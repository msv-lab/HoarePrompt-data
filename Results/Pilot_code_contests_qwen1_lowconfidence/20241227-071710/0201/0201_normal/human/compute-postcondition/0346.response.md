The code `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the index `new_nodes[j] + 1` in the `nodes` list. Given that `j` is equal to `len(new_nodes)`, this means that the last element of `new_nodes` is being used to determine the index.

From the initial state:
- `new_nodes` is a list of values
- `p` is the final value
- `abort` is `True`
- `c` is `-len(new_nodes)`
- `nodes` is unchanged except `nodes[-1] = -1` and `nodes[new_nodes[len(new_nodes) - 1] + 1] = -1`
- `count` is 0
- `i` is `n-1`
- `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks
- `c` is less than 0
- `j` is `len(new_nodes)`
- `len(new_nodes)` must be greater than 0

Given that `j` is equal to `len(new_nodes)`, the code modifies `nodes` at the index `new_nodes[len(new_nodes) - 1] + 1`. From the initial state, we know that `nodes[new_nodes[len(new_nodes) - 1] + 1]` is already set to `-1`. However, the code will overwrite this value, setting it again to `-1`.

Therefore, the value of `nodes[new_nodes[len(new_nodes) - 1] + 1]` remains `-1` after the code execution.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is a list of values, `p` is the final value, `abort` is `True`, `c` is `-len(new_nodes)`, `nodes` is unchanged except `nodes[-1] = -1` and `nodes[new_nodes[len(new_nodes) - 1] + 1] = -1`, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks, `c` is less than 0, `j` is `len(new_nodes)`, `len(new_nodes)` must be greater than 0**
