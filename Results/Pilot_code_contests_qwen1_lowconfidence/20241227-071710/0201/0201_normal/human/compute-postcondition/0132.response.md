`new_nodes` is appended with the value of `p`. The value of `p` is `(4 * n - 2) * 2`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code, so they remain as per the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 4 * `n` - 2, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[p]`, `p` is (4 * `n` - 2) * 2, `abort` is True if `flag` equals -1, and `abort` remains False if `flag` does not equal -1 and does not equal (4 * `n` - 2) * 2 + 1. If `flag` equals 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
