Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is a list containing all the elements appended during the loop, `p` is the last index of `new_nodes` (or -1 if `new_nodes` is empty). If `c >= 0`, then `abort` is `False`, `nodes[p + 1]` for each `p` in `new_nodes` is `1`, `c` is `0`, and `count` is `0`. Otherwise, all `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` for `j` in the range `[-len(new_nodes), -1]` are `-1`, and `j` is `-len(new_nodes) - 1`.***
