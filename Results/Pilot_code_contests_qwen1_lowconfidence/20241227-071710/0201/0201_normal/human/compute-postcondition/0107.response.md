The code `stack_append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the stack. Based on the initial state, `nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, and `v` is the value at index `t + 1` in the `storage` list. If `v` equals `parent_index`, the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the value of `v` is appended to the stack.

Since `v` is not explicitly assigned a new value in the given code snippet, the only change is that `v` is added to the stack. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, and `v` is the value at index `t + 1` in the `storage` list; the value of `v` is appended to the stack.**
