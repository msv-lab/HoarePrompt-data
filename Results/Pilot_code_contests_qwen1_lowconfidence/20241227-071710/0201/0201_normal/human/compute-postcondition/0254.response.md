According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p`. The loop iterates over each element in `new_nodes`. At the end of the previous iteration, `new_nodes` must have at least one element, `p` is the last index of `new_nodes` or -1 if `new_nodes` is empty, `abort` and `nodes` will be updated within the loop, and `c` is greater than or equal to 0. Since `p` is set to the last index of `new_nodes` (or -1 if `new_nodes` is empty), for the loop to execute again, `new_nodes` must have at least two elements. This way, `p` will point to the second-to-last element of `new_nodes`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `new_nodes` must have at least one element.
- `p` is the last index of `new_nodes` or -1 if `new_nodes` is empty.
- `abort` and `nodes` will be updated within the loop.
- `c` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `nodes[p + 1]` is 1.

For the loop to execute again, `new_nodes` must have at least two elements, so that `p` points to the second-to-last element, and `nodes[p + 1]` remains 1.

State: **`new_nodes` must have at least two elements, `p` is the second-to-last index of `new_nodes` or -1 if `new_nodes` has only one element, `abort` and `nodes` will be updated within the loop, `c` is greater than or equal to 0; `nodes[p + 1]` is 1**
