The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables and simply exits the loop or the most internal loop or if statement. Given the initial state and the fact that no variables are being updated or reassigned in the `break` statement, the only thing that changes is that we break out of the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is `(n-1) * 2`, `abort` is `False`, `c` is unknown, `nodes` is unchanged, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `flag` is `nodes[(n-1) * 2 + 1]`, and `flag` is equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
