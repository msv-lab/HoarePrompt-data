According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `new_nodes`. For the loop to execute again, `new_nodes` must contain at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `new_nodes` must have contained at least one element, and `nodes[p + 1]` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `new_nodes` must still contain at least one element. The value of `p` will change with each iteration, but the condition for the loop to continue is that `new_nodes` must not be empty.

State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one element, `nodes[p + 1]` is 1**
