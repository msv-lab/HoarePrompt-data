`p` is set to the first element in `new_nodes`. The code then assigns the value `1` to `nodes[p + 1]`. Since `p` was set to the first element in `new_nodes`, `p + 1` refers to the second element in the `nodes` list. The value of `new_nodes` remains unchanged, and the value of `p` also remains the same because the assignment does not affect `p`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` contains at least one element, `p` is the first element in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is now 1**
