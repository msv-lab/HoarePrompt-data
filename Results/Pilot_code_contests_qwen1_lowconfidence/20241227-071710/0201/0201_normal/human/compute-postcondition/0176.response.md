The code `nodes[p + 1] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the element in the list `nodes` at index `p + 1`. The value of `p` is not specified in the initial state, but it does not affect the general understanding that `nodes[p + 1]` is being set to 1. The precondition that `new_nodes` must contain at least one element and `abort` must be `False` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` contains at least one element, `abort` is `False`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `1`**
