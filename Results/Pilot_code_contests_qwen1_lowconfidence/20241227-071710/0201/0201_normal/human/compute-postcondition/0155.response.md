Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0; `i` is \(4 \times n - 2\); `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p]`; `abort` remains `False`; `index` is `nodes[p]`; `flag` is the value at index `p + 1` in the `nodes` list; `p` is `index * 2`, and if `flag` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `flag` is not 1, the state remains unchanged.***
