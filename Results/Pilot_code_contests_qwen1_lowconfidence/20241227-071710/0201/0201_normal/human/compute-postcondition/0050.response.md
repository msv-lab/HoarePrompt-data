The `continue` statement in the given code does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the containing loop. Since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the only impact is that the loop (if present) would skip the remaining part of the current iteration.

Given the initial state and the fact that no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `u`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with all elements set to 0, `stack` now contains `u`, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is `n`, `parent_index` is `0`, `t` is `u`, `v` is `u`, and `nodes[u * 2]` is `n`.**
