The code assigns the value of `nodes[p]` to `index`. From the initial state, we know that `p` is `(4 * n - 3) * 2`. Since `nodes` is a list containing one element `(4 * n - 3) * 2`, and this element is `(4 * n - 3) * 2`, it follows that `nodes[p]` is `(4 * n - 3) * 2`. Therefore, `index` is set to `(4 * n - 3) * 2`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `4 * n - 3`; `new_nodes` is a list containing one element `(4 * n - 3) * 2`; `abort` is `True` if `flag` equals `-1`; otherwise, `abort` remains `False`; `index` is `(4 * n - 3) * 2`; `c` is an integer; `p` is `(4 * n - 3) * 2`; `flag` is `-1` if `flag` equals `-1`; otherwise, `flag` is `1`.**
