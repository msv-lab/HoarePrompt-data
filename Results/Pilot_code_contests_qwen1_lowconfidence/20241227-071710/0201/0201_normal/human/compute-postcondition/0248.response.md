The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not include a loop, so the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The `continue` statement simply indicates that the loop would continue to its next iteration if it were present.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is the last index of `new_nodes` (or -1 if `new_nodes` is empty), `abort` is `True` if any `flag` at `p + 1` was `-1` when the loop stopped, otherwise `abort` is `False`, and `nodes` is updated such that for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`.**
