`t` is assigned the value of `storage[t + 1]`, and `v` is assigned the value of `storage[t + 1]`. After executing `t = storage[t]`, the value of `t` changes to the value stored in `storage[t + 1]`. The state of `v` remains unchanged as it was initially assigned the value of `storage[t + 1]`.

Output State: **`storage[t + 1]' is assigned to `v', `t` is the value of `storage[t + 1]'**
