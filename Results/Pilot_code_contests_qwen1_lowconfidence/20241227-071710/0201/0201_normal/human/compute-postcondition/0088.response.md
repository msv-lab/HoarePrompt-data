Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations.

### Initial State Recap:
- `storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`
- `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`
- `lookup[v]` is undefined
- `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`
- `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[u * 2]` set to `n` and all other elements set to 0
- `stack` now contains one less occurrence of `u`
- `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`
- `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`
- `index` is the new value of the last element in the stack (which was `n`)
- `parent_index` is `n`
- `t` is `lookup[index]` which is `4 * n - 2`
- `v` is `u`
- `nodes[u * 2]` is `n`

### Loop Analysis:
The loop condition is `while t >= 0:`. The loop updates `v` and `t` based on the values in the `storage` array. Specifically:
- `v = storage[t + 1]`
- `t = storage[t]`
- If `v == parent_index`, the loop continues without further updates.
- Otherwise, `nodes[v * 2] = index` and `stack_append(v)`.

From the given output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we observe that:
- After each iteration, `v` increases by 1.
- `t` remains `4 * n - 2` throughout the iterations.
- `stack` accumulates values of `v` starting from `u`.

### Final State Determination:
- Since `t` starts at `4 * n - 2` and the loop continues until `t < 0`, the loop will iterate `4 * n - 2` times.
- Each iteration increments `v` by 1, so after `4 * n - 2` iterations, `v` will be `u + 4 * n - 2`.
- During these iterations, `nodes[v * 2]` is set to `index` for each `v` from `u` to `u + 4 * n - 2`.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, the state of the variables will be:
- `storage[storage_index]` remains `4 * n - 2`
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` remains `u`
- `lookup[u]` remains `4 * n - 2`
- `lookup[v]` remains undefined since `v` only gets updated within the loop.
- `storage_index` remains `8 * n - 4`
- `nodes` will have `nodes[u * 2]` and `nodes[(u + 4 * n - 2) * 2]` set to `n`, and `nodes[v * 2]` for `v` from `u + 1` to `u + 4 * n - 3` set to `n`.
- `stack` will contain all values from `u` to `u + 4 * n - 2`.
- `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`
- `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`
- `index` will be `u + 4 * n - 2`
- `parent_index` remains `n`
- `v` will be `u + 4 * n - 2`
- `nodes[u * 2]` remains `n`
- `t` will be `-1` since the loop exits when `t < 0`
