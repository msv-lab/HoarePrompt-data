The `storage_index` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `storage_index` was `storage_index + 12`. After incrementing by 2, the new value of `storage_index` is `(storage_index + 12) + 2`, which simplifies to `storage_index + 14`.

The other variables (`storage[storage_index]`, `storage[storage_index + 1]`, `lookup[u]`, `lookup[v]`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index + 10`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index + 10`, `lookup[v]` is `storage_index + 12`, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 14**
