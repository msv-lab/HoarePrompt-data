`p` is assigned the value `index * 2`. The value of `index` is `nodes[p]`, so `p` becomes `nodes[p] * 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `flag` is equal to `nodes[p + 1]`, `new_nodes` contains the original elements plus `p`, and `index` is `nodes[p]`; `p` is now `nodes[p] * 2`.

Output State: **`flag` is equal to `nodes[p + 1]`, `new_nodes` contains the original elements plus `p`, and `index` is `nodes[p]`; `p` is now `nodes[p] * 2`.**
