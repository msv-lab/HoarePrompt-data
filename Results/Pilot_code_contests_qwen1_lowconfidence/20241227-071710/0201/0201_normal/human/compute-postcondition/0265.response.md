The code snippet assigns the value `-1` to `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]`. This means that the element in the `nodes` list at the index `new_nodes[j] + 1` is updated to `-1`. The other elements in the `nodes` list and any other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is -1**
