`new_nodes.append(p)` appends the value of `p` to the list `new_nodes`. The value of `p` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `flag` is equal to `nodes[p + 1]`, and either `flag` equals -1 in which case `abort` is `True`, or no changes are made to the variables, maintaining the precondition state.

Since `new_nodes` is being appended to, it will contain the updated list with `p` added to it. The other variables (`flag`, `nodes`, `abort`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.

Output State: **`flag` is equal to `nodes[p + 1]`, `new_nodes` contains the original elements plus `p`, and either `flag` equals -1 in which case `abort` is `True`, or no changes are made to the variables, maintaining the precondition state.**
