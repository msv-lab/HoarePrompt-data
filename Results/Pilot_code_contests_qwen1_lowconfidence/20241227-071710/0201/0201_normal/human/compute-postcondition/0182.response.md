The code `count = c` assigns the current value of `c` to `count`. According to the initial state, `c` is equal to `count - len(new_nodes)`, and since `new_nodes` is an empty list, `len(new_nodes)` is 0. Thus, `c` is equal to `count`.

After executing the line `count = c`, the value of `count` is updated to the current value of `c`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `abort` is `False`, `nodes[p + 1]` for each valid `p` in `new_nodes` is `1`, `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`, `count` is equal to `c`**
