The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block that the `break` statement would exit, the variables remain unchanged. The precondition remains valid after the code execution.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `4 * n - 3`; `new_nodes` is a list containing one element `(4 * n - 3) * 2`; `abort` remains `True` if `flag` equals `-1`; otherwise, `abort` remains `False`; `index` is `(4 * n - 3) * 2`; `c` is an integer; `p` is `(4 * n - 3) * 2`; `flag` is `-1` if `flag` equals `-1`; otherwise, `flag` is `1`; `index` is less than or equal to 0**
