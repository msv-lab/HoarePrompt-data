The code `break` does not assign any new values to the variables. It only exits the current loop or match-case statement. Since no such loop or match-case was provided in the initial state, the only thing that happens is breaking out of the most internal loop or match-case we were inside, if there was one. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`flag` is equal to `nodes[p + 1]'**
