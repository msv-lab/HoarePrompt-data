`abort` is assigned the value `True`. This changes the value of `abort` from its previous state, while the values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0; `i` is \(4 \times n - 2\); `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p]`; `abort` is `True`; `index` is `nodes[p]`; `flag` is the value at index `p + 1` in the `nodes` list; `p` is `index * 2`.
