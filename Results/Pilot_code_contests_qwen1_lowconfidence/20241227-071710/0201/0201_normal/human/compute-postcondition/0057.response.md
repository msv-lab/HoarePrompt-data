The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, the initial state is that `storage[t + 1]` is assigned to `v`, and `t` is the value of `storage[t + 1]`. The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but skips the remaining part of the current loop iteration.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`storage[t + 1]' is assigned to `v', `t` is the value of `storage[t + 1]'**
