Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 4 * `n` - 2, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p, p, ...]` with each element following the pattern until no further valid `p` can be found, `abort` is `True`, `index` is the last valid value of `index` before the loop breaks or all elements in `new_nodes` are exhausted.***

This postcondition retains all the information from the precondition and includes the fact that the if condition (`abort`) is true.
