Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: We start with the following states:
   - `new_nodes` is a list of values.
   - `p` is the final value.
   - `abort` is `True`.
   - `c` is `-len(new_nodes)`.
   - `nodes` is unchanged.
   - `count` is 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks.
   - `c` is less than 0.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for j in xrange(-c):`. This means the loop will run from `j = -c` to `j = 0`.

3. **Condition Analysis**:
   - For the loop to start, `c` must be negative (which it is since `c` is set to `-len(new_nodes)` and `len(new_nodes)` is non-negative).
   - The loop will iterate as long as `j` is in the range from `-c` to `0`.

4. **Required Adjustments**:
   - `c` should be a negative number, and it already is since `c` is set to `-len(new_nodes)`.
   - The loop will start when `j` is `-c` and decrement until `j` reaches `0`. Therefore, the initial value of `j` must be `-c`.
   - Since `c` is defined as `-len(new_nodes)`, we need to ensure `len(new_nodes)` is positive (since `c` is negative).

5. **Final States**:
   - `c` must be a negative number (which it is).
   - The loop will start with `j` being `-c`, so `j` must be initialized to `-c`.
   - To ensure the loop runs at least once, `len(new_nodes)` must be greater than 0.

Given these points, the necessary adjustments are:
- Ensure `len(new_nodes)` is greater than 0.
- Set `j` to `-c`.

The modified state is:
**`new_nodes` is a list of values, `p` is the final value, `abort` is `True`, `c` is `-len(new_nodes)`, `nodes` is unchanged, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks, `c` is less than 0, `j` is `-c`, and `len(new_nodes)` must be greater than 0.**

State: **`new_nodes` is a list of values, `p` is the final value, `abort` is `True`, `c` is `-len(new_nodes)`, `nodes` is unchanged, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks, `c` is less than 0, `j` is `-c`, `len(new_nodes)` must be greater than 0**
