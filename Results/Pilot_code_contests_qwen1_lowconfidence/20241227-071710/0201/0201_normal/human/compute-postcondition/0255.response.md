The code `nodes[p + 1] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the element at the index `p + 1` in the list `nodes`. According to the initial state, `nodes[p + 1]` was already 1, so this assignment does not change its value. However, the assignment operation itself is performed.

Output State: **`new_nodes` must have at least two elements, `p` is the second-to-last index of `new_nodes` or -1 if `new_nodes` has only one element, `abort` and `nodes` will be updated within the loop, `c` is greater than or equal to 0; `nodes[p + 1]` is 1**
