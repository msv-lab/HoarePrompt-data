Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We are given the postconditions for the loop. The key points from these postconditions are:
   - `new_nodes` contains all the elements appended during the loop.
   - `p` is the last index of `new_nodes` (or -1 if `new_nodes` is empty).
   - `abort` is `True` if any `flag` at `p + 1` was `-1` when the loop stopped; otherwise, `abort` is `False`.
   - `nodes` is updated such that for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`.
   - `c` is greater than `len(new_nodes)`.

2. **Loop Range**: The loop runs from `j = -c` to `j < 0`. This means the loop will run for `c` iterations in reverse order starting from `-c`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `c` must be greater than or equal to 1 because the loop will run from `-c` to `-1` (inclusive), meaning `c` should be at least 1.
   - Since the loop is defined to run in reverse, we don't need to consider the initial values of `new_nodes`, `p`, `abort`, or `nodes` directly within the loop. Instead, we need to ensure the conditions that would lead to these postconditions being met after the loop.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - To ensure the loop can run, `c` must be at least 1.
   - The initial state of `new_nodes` does not affect the loop condition itself but will be modified during the loop. However, we need to ensure that the loop will run as specified, which is determined by `c`.
   - The state of `p`, `abort`, and `nodes` is dependent on what happens inside the loop, but since the loop condition is based on `c`, these do not need to be adjusted specifically in the pre-loop state.

Therefore, the key adjustment needed is to ensure `c` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

**State:**
**`c` must be greater than or equal to 1**
