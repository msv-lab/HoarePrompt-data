Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is a list of values, `p` is the final value, `abort` is `True`, `c` is 0, `nodes` is unchanged, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks.***

Explanation: Since the condition `c >= 0` is met, `c` must be updated to 0 as per the typical behavior of such conditions in loops. The other variables retain their states as described in the precondition.
