The code appends the value of `p` to `new_nodes`. Given the initial state, let's break down the changes:

- `new_nodes` is initially `[n-1] * 2, index * 2`.
- `p` is `index * 2`.
- The code appends `p` to `new_nodes`.

So, `new_nodes` will now be `[n-1] * 2, index * 2, index * 2`.

The other variables (`c`, `nodes`, `count`, `i`, `index`, `flag`, `abort`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `new_nodes` is `[n-1] * 2, index * 2, index * 2`, `p` is `index * 2`, `c` is unknown, `nodes` is unchanged, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `index` is `nodes[index * 2]`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 2]`, and `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on the value of `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[n-1] * 2, index * 2, index * 2`, `p` is `index * 2`, `c` is unknown, `nodes` is unchanged, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `index` is `nodes[index * 2]`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 2]`, and `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on the value of `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`.**
