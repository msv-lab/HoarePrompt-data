Let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index + 2`
   - `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `v`
   - `lookup[u]` is `storage_index + 4`
   - `storage_index` is `storage_index + 6`

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code sets `storage[storage_index]` to `lookup[v]`.
   
   - From the initial state, we know:
     - `storage[storage_index]` is initially `storage_index + 2`.
     - `lookup[u]` is `storage_index + 4`.
     - `storage_index` is now `storage_index + 6` (after the assignment in the initial state).

3. **Calculation**:
   - Since `storage[storage_index]` is being updated to `lookup[v]`, and `lookup[v]` is `storage_index + 4` (based on the initial state), the new value of `storage[storage_index]` will be `storage_index + 4`.

4. **Updated Values**:
   - `storage[storage_index]` is now `storage_index + 4`.
   - `storage[storage_index + 1]` remains `v`.
   - `lookup[u]` remains `storage_index + 4`.
   - `storage_index` remains `storage_index + 6`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index + 4`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `v`, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index + 4`, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 6`**.
