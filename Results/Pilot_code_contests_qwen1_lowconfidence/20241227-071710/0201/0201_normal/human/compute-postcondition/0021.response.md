Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - We start with the state where `storage_index` was incremented by 6 initially, making it `storage_index + 6`.
   - After the line `storage_index += 2`, the value of `storage_index` becomes `storage_index + 8`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition for the given for loop is iterating over the `edges` tuple.
   - The loop body is omitted, but the key part here is the increment of `storage_index` by 2.

3. **Current State Before Next Iteration:**
   - `storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index + 4`.
   - `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`.
   - `lookup[u]` is `storage_index + 4`.
   - `lookup[v]` is `storage_index`.
   - `storage_index` is `storage_index + 8`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next pair `(u, v)` from the `edges` list needs to be processed.
   - After processing, `storage_index` will be incremented by 2 again, making it `storage_index + 10`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - The state of `storage[storage_index]` will be updated based on the current value of `storage_index`.
   - The state of `storage[storage_index + 1]` will be updated based on the current value of `storage_index`.
   - The state of `lookup[u]` and `lookup[v]` will be updated accordingly.
   - The new value of `storage_index` will be `storage_index + 10`.

Thus, the updated state before the next iteration of the loop should be:

**`storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index + 6`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index + 6`, `lookup[v]` is `storage_index + 8`, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 10**
