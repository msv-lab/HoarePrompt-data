Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 4 * `n` - 2, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[p]`, `p` is (4 * `n` - 2) * 2, `abort` is True if `flag` equals -1, and `abort` remains False if `flag` does not equal -1 and does not equal (4 * `n` - 2) * 2 + 1, `index` is `[p]`. The current value of `index` is less than or equal to 0.**
