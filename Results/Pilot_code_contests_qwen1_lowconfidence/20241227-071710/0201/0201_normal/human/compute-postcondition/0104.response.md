The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables outside the loop. Therefore, the values of `nodes[v * 2]` and `v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `u + 4 * n - 2`, `v` is the value at index `t + 1` in the `storage` list**
