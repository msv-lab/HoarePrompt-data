The code `nodes[p + 1] = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the index `p + 1` in the list `nodes`. According to the initial state, `nodes[nodes[new_nodes[0]] + 1]` is already `-1`, which means the value at this index was already `-1` before the assignment. Since the value at `nodes[p + 1]` was also `-1` initially, the assignment does not change its value. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`new_nodes` must have at least 1 element, `nodes[nodes[new_nodes[0]] + 1]` is `-1`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`**
