The line `stack_append = stack.append` assigns the `append` method of the `stack` list to the variable `stack_append`. This does not change the values of the other variables, but it does make `stack_append` a reference to the `append` method.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is `4 * n - 4`, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with all elements set to 0, `stack` is `[n]`, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`.
