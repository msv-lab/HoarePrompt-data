The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or block of code. Since no loops or blocks are specified in the given code snippet, the variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is `(n-1) * 2`, `abort` is `True`, `c` is unknown, `nodes` is unchanged, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `flag` is -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
