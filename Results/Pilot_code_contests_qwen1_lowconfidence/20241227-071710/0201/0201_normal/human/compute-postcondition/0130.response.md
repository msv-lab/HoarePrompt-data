Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 4 * n - 2, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is (4 * n - 2) * 2, `abort` is False, and `flag` is not (4 * n - 2) * 2 + 1. If `flag` equals 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if `flag` does not equal 1.***
