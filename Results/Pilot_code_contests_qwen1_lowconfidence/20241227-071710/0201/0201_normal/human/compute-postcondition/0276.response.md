According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute as long as the condition is not explicitly broken (e.g., by setting `abort` to `True`). The only variable that could potentially affect the execution of the loop is `abort`, which is currently set to `False`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we do not need to adjust any other state variables because the loop is unconditional (`while True`). The loop will continue to execute until `abort` is set to `True`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the given states.

State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is `(n-1) * 2`, `abort` is `False`, `c` is unknown, `nodes` is unchanged, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`**
