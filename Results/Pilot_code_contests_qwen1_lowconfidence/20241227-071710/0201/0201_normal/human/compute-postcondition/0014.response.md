The code `storage[storage_index + 1] = v` assigns the value `v` to `storage[storage_index + 1]`. According to the initial state, `storage[storage_index + 1]` was equal to the next `u`. After executing the code, this value is updated to `v`.

Here's the breakdown:

- `storage[storage_index]` is still `storage_index - 2`
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` is now `v` (previously it was the next `u`)
- `lookup[u]` is still `storage_index - 2`
- `storage_index` is still `storage_index + 4`

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index - 2`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `v`, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index - 2`, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 4`**
