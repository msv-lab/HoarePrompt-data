Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is \(4 \times n - 2\), `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4]`, `abort` remains `True` if `flag` equals \(-(8n - 4) - 1\), `abort` remains `False` if `flag` does not equal \(-(8n - 4) - 1\) and does not equal \(8n - 3\), `index` is `[16n - 8]`, `flag` is assigned the value at index \(8n - 3\) of the `nodes` list.**
