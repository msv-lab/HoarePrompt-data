The code assigns `u` to `storage[storage_index + 1]`. Based on the initial state:
- `storage[storage_index]` is equal to `lookup[v]`
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` is equal to `v`
- `lookup[u]` is equal to `storage_index - 2`
- `storage_index` is `storage_index + 2`

After executing the line `storage[storage_index + 1] = u`, the value of `storage[storage_index + 1]` changes to `u`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is equal to `lookup[v]`; `storage[storage_index + 1]` is equal to `u`; `lookup[u]` is equal to `storage_index - 2`; `storage_index` is `storage_index + 2`**
