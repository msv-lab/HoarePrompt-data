The code `new_nodes.append(p)` appends the value of `p` to the list `new_nodes`. Initially, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4]`. After appending `p`, the list will contain two elements: `[8n - 4, p]`.

Other variables such as `n`, `i`, `abort`, `index`, and `flag` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is \(4 \times n - 2\); `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p]`; `abort` remains `True` if `flag` equals \(-(8n - 4) - 1\), `abort` remains `False` if `flag` does not equal \(-(8n - 4) - 1\) and does not equal \(8n - 3\); `index` is `[16n - 8]`; `flag` is assigned the value at index \(8n - 3\) of the `nodes` list.**
