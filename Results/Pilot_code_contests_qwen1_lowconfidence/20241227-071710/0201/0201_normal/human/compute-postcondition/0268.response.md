According to the code, the loop runs using the variable `j` and it starts from `-c` and increments `j` by 1 each time until `j` reaches 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `nodes[new_nodes[0] + 1]` is -1, and `j` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than -c. Since `j` is currently 0, we need to decrease `j` by 1 to make it -1. This means the loop will execute again if `j` is -1.

Additionally, since the loop condition depends on `j` being less than `-c`, we need to ensure that `j` is -1 for the next iteration to occur. The value of `nodes[new_nodes[0] + 1]` does not change based on the loop iteration and remains -1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`nodes[new_nodes[0] + 1]` is -1, `j` is -1**
