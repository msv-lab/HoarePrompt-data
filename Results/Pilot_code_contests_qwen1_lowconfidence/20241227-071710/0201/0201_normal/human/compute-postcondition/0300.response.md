The code `index = nodes[p]` assigns the value of `nodes[p]` to the variable `index`. The value of `index` is already defined as `nodes[p]`, so this assignment does not change the value of `index`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[n-1] * 2, p`, `p` is `index * 2` if `index > 0` else `(n-1) * 2`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on the value of `nodes[p + 1]`, `c` is unknown, `nodes` is unchanged, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `index` is `nodes[p]`, `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`.**
