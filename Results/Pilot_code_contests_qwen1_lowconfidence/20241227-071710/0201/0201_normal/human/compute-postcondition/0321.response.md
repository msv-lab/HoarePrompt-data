The code updates the value of `nodes[p + 1]` to `-1`. The initial state tells us that `new_nodes` must have at least 1 element and `nodes[nodes[new_nodes[0]] + 1]` is `-1`. However, the value of `p` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `nodes[p + 1]` without knowing `p`. We know that `nodes[p + 1]` is being set to `-1`.

Since the initial state of `nodes[nodes[new_nodes[0]] + 1]` is `-1`, this condition remains true after the code execution.

Output State: **`new_nodes` must have at least 1 element, `nodes[nodes[new_nodes[0]] + 1]` is `-1`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`**
