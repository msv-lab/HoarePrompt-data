Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is `[n-1] * 2`, `p` is `index * 2` if `index > 0` else `(n-1) * 2`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on the value of `nodes[p + 1]`, `c` is unknown, `nodes` is unchanged, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `index` is `nodes[p]`, `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`, and if `flag == 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.***
