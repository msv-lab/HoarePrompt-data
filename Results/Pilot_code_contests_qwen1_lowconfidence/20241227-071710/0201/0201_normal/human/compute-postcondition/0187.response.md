To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given conditions and the loop statement:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `i` is `4 * n - 2`
   - `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p, p, ...]` with each element following the pattern until no further valid `p` can be found
   - `abort` is `True`
   - `index` is the last valid value of `index` before the loop breaks or all elements in `new_nodes` are exhausted
   - `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`
   - `c` is less than 0

2. **Loop Condition:**
   ```
   for j in xrange(-c):
   ```

The loop will iterate from `-c` to `0` (inclusive), but since `c` is less than 0, `-c` will be a positive integer.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `c` is less than 0, `-c` will be a positive integer. This means the loop will execute as long as `j` takes values from `0` to `-c - 1`.
   - The loop will execute if `j` ranges from `0` to `-c - 1`, where `-c` is a positive integer.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `c` is less than 0, which it already is according to the initial state. We also need to ensure that `new_nodes` has enough elements to support the loop iterations, and `index` should be properly set.

### Adjusted States:
- `c` is less than 0 (already satisfied)
- `new_nodes` must have at least `-c` elements, because the loop will run `-c` times.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `4 * n - 2`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p, p, ...]` with each element following the pattern until no further valid `p` can be found, `abort` is `True`, `index` is the last valid value of `index` before the loop breaks or all elements in `new_nodes` are exhausted, `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)` and must be less than 0, `new_nodes` must have at least `-c` elements**
