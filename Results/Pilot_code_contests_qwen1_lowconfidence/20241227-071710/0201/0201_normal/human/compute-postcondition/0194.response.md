Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `4 * n - 2`, `new_nodes` is a list, `abort` is a boolean, `index` is an integer, and `c` is an integer. If `c >= 0`, then `new_nodes` is an empty list, `abort` is `False`, `nodes[p + 1]` for each valid `p` in `new_nodes` is `1`, `c` is `0`, and `count` is equal to `0`. Otherwise, `i` is `4 * n - 2`, `abort` is `True`, `index` is the last valid value of `index` before the loop breaks or all elements in `new_nodes` are exhausted, `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)` and must be less than 0, `new_nodes` must have at least `-c` elements, and `nodes` has `-1` at the indices specified by `new_nodes[j] + 1` for every valid `j` in the range of `-c`.***
