Let's go through the code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `i` is \(4 \times n - 2\)
   - `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p]`
   - `abort` remains `False`
   - `index` is `nodes[p]`
   - `flag` is assigned the value at index \(8n - 3\) of the `nodes` list
   - `p` is `index * 2`

2. Code Execution:
   ```python
   flag = nodes[p + 1]
   ```
   This line of code assigns the value at index `p + 1` in the `nodes` list to the variable `flag`.

3. Updated Values:
   - `flag` now holds the value at index `p + 1` in the `nodes` list.
   - All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is \(4 \times n - 2\)
- `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p]`
- `abort` remains `False`
- `index` is `nodes[p]`
- `flag` is the value at index `p + 1` in the `nodes` list
- `p` is `index * 2`

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is \(4 \times n - 2\); `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p]`; `abort` remains `False`; `index` is `nodes[p]`; `flag` is the value at index `p + 1` in the `nodes` list; `p` is `index * 2`**
