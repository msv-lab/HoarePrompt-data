The code `stack_pop = stack.pop` assigns the method `pop` of the `stack` list to the variable `stack_pop`. This does not change the contents of the `stack` list itself but just changes the name used to reference the `pop` method.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the assignment of the method:

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is `4 * n - 4`, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with all elements set to 0, `stack` is `[n]`, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`.**
