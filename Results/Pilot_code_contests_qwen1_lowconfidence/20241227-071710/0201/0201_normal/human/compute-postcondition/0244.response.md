`nodes[p + 1]` is assigned the value `-1`. Given the initial state, `p` is 1, so `nodes[p + 1]` is equivalent to `nodes[2]`. The value of `new_nodes` is unchanged, and `abort` remains `True`. The value of `nodes[1]` is still `-1`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one element, `p` is 1, `abort` is `True`, and `nodes[1]` is `-1`; `nodes[2]` is `-1`**
