Let's break down the problem step by step.

We start with the following states right before the `while True` loop:

- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `4 * n - 3`
- `new_nodes` is an empty list
- `abort` is `False`
- `index` is an integer
- `c` is an integer
- `p` is `(4 * n - 3) * 2`

The loop condition for this `while True` loop is always true, meaning the loop will definitely execute at least one time regardless of the current state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to any of the variables for the loop to proceed.

However, since we need to provide a modified state to indicate that the loop can proceed, we will simply repeat the given state as there are no necessary adjustments.

State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `4 * n - 3`; `new_nodes` is an empty list; `abort` is `False`; `index` is an integer; `c` is an integer; `p` is `(4 * n - 3) * 2`**
