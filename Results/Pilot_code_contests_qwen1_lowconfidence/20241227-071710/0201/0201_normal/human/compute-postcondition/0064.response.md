The code `parent_index = nodes[index * 2]` assigns the value of `nodes[index * 2]` to `parent_index`. Given that `index` is the new value of the last element in the stack (which was `n`), `parent_index` will be the value of `nodes[n * 2]`.

From the initial state, we know that `nodes[u * 2]` is `n`. Since `v` is `u`, `nodes[u * 2]` is also `n`. Therefore, `parent_index` will be `n`.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[u * 2]` set to `n` and all other elements set to 0, `stack` now contains one less occurrence of `u`, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is the new value of the last element in the stack (which was `n`), `parent_index` is `n`, `t` is a negative number, `v` is `u`, and `nodes[u * 2]` is `n`.
