The code `index = stack_pop()` pops the top element from the `stack` and assigns it to `index`. Given the initial state, the stack `stack` contains `[n]`. Popping this element means `index` will be assigned `n`, and the stack will be left empty.

Here is the updated state:

- `storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`
- `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`
- `lookup[v]` is `4 * n - 4`
- `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`
- `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with all elements set to 0
- `stack` is now an empty list
- `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`
- `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`
- `index` is `n`

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is `4 * n - 4`, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with all elements set to 0, `stack` is an empty list, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is `n**
