Let's break down the given information and the for loop step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- `new_nodes` is a list of values.
- `p` is the final value.
- `abort` is `True`.
- `c` is `-len(new_nodes)`.
- `nodes` is unchanged except `nodes[-1] = -1`.
- `count` is 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks.
- `c` is less than 0.
- `j` is `-c`.
- `len(new_nodes)` must be greater than 0.

### For Loop:
```
for j in xrange(-c):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The loop runs from `j` starting at `-c` and ends when `j` is no longer in the range specified by `xrange(-c)`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range defined by `xrange(-c)`. 

3. **Current State**:
   - `c` is `-len(new_nodes)`.
   - `j` is `-c`.

Given that `c` is less than 0, `-c` will be a positive integer. Specifically, `-c` is equal to `len(new_nodes)`, which is greater than 0.

4. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will run for each value of `j` from `-c` (which is `len(new_nodes)`) down to 0.
   - Since `len(new_nodes)` is greater than 0, `j` will decrement from `len(new_nodes)` to 1 and finally to 0.

5. **State Adjustments**:
   - After the loop completes, `j` will be 0 because it starts at `-c` and decrements until it reaches 0.
   - The loop condition will no longer be satisfied since `j` will be 0 and `xrange(-c)` does not include 0 (it includes numbers from `-c` to 1).

6. **Required State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be in the range `xrange(-c)`. This means `j` must be a positive number less than `-c`.
   - Therefore, `j` must be `-c - 1` (the next value before 0).

### Final State:
- `new_nodes` remains unchanged.
- `p` remains the same.
- `abort` remains `True`.
- `c` remains `-len(new_nodes)`.
- `nodes` remains unchanged except `nodes[-1] = -1`.
- `count` remains 0.
- `i` remains `n-1`.
- `index` remains the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks.
- `c` remains less than 0.
- `j` is `-c - 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `new_nodes` is a list of values, `p` is the final value, `abort` is `True`, `c` is `-len(new_nodes)`, `nodes` is unchanged except `nodes[-1] = -1`, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks, `c` is less than 0, `j` is `-c - 1`, `len(new_nodes)` must be greater than 0**
