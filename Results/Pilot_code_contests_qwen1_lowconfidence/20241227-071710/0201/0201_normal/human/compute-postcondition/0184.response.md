The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the loop or the most nested loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `abort` is `False`, `nodes[p + 1]` for each valid `p` in `new_nodes` is `1`, `c` is `0`, `count` is equal to `0`**
