The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`. 

- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n.
- `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a bidirectional edge between two distinct districts (u, v) in Panel.
- The constraint 2 * (n + 1) ≥ 4 * n applies.

The function does not explicitly state a return value in the given information, but we know from the context that it likely returns some form of result based on the parameters and the edges provided.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept positive integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ k < n, and a list of tuples representing bidirectional edges between districts, and process this information according to the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k < n), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing bidirectional edges between districts), and processes this information based on the given constraints.**
