The line `sys.setcheckinterval(2147483647)` sets the interval for garbage collection in the Python interpreter. However, this does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `k`, or `edges`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n` ≤ 10^6, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the districts connected by a path.**
