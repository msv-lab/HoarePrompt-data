`nodes[v * 2]` is assigned the value of `index`. Given that `v` is equal to `u` and `index` is equal to `n`, the value of `nodes[u * 2]` will be updated to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[u * 2]` set to `n` and `nodes[v * 2]` set to `n`, `stack` now contains `u` and `u + 1`, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is `n`, `parent_index` is `n`, `v` is `u`, `t` is `4 * n - 2` or `u` depending on its initial value.**
