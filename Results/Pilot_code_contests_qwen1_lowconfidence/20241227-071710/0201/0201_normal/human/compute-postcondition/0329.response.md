Let's break down the given state and the for loop statement step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given State:
- `new_nodes` is a list of values.
- `p` is the final value (though this is irrelevant for determining the initial state).
- `abort` is `True`.
- `c` is 0.
- `nodes` is unchanged.
- `count` is 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for p in new_nodes:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `new_nodes`. The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `new_nodes`.

2. **Initial State**:
   - The variable `p` will take on the values from `new_nodes` one by one.
   - The initial value of `p` is `n-1` (though this is the value of `i` at the start, it does not directly influence the loop's condition).

3. **List `new_nodes`**: Since the loop iterates over `new_nodes`, `new_nodes` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `abort` being `True` is not directly related to the loop condition but could affect the behavior inside the loop.
   - `c`, `count`, `i`, and `index` are not directly relevant to the loop condition itself but will be updated within the loop body.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute, the only state that needs to be adjusted is that `new_nodes` must contain at least one element. 

### Final Answer:
State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one element**
