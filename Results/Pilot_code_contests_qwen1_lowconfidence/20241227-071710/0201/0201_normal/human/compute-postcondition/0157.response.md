The code snippet appends the value of `p` to the `new_nodes` list. The value of `p` is defined as `index * 2`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is \(4 \times n - 2\)
- `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p]`
- `abort` remains unchanged (either `True` or `False`)
- `index` is `nodes[p]`
- `flag` is the value at index `p + 1` in the `nodes` list
- `p` is `index * 2`

The value of `p` is already determined from the initial state, so appending `p` to `new_nodes` changes its contents. The updated `new_nodes` will now contain `[8n - 4, p, p]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is \(4 \times n - 2\); `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p, p]`; `abort` remains unchanged (either `True` or `False`); `index` is `nodes[p]`; `flag` is the value at index `p + 1` in the `nodes` list; `p` is `index * 2`.**
