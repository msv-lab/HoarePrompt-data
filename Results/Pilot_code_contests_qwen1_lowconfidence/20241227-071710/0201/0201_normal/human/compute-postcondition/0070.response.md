The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not have any direct impact on the variables outside of the loop scope. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[u * 2]` set to `n` and all other elements set to 0, `stack` now contains one less occurrence of `u`, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is the new value of the last element in the stack (which was `n`), `parent_index` is `n`, `v` is `u`, `nodes[u * 2]` is `n`, `t` is `4 * n - 2`, and the value of `v` is equal to the value of `parent_index`.**
