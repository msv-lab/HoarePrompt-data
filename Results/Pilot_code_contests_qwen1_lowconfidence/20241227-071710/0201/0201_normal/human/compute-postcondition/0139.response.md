First, let's determine the value of `i` based on the initial state:
- Initial State: `i` is \(4 \times n - 2\)

Next, let's determine the value of `p` based on the initial state:
- Initial State: `new_nodes` is a list containing `[p]` where \(p = (4 \times n - 2) \times 2\)
Thus, \(p = (4 \times n - 2) \times 2 = 8n - 4\).

The code snippet is:
```python
flag = nodes[p + 1]
```

Since `nodes` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot directly determine its contents. However, the value of `p + 1` is \(8n - 4 + 1 = 8n - 3\). This means `flag` is assigned the value at index \(8n - 3\) of the `nodes` list.

Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is \(4 \times n - 2\), `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4]`, `abort` remains `True` if `flag` equals \(-(8n - 4) - 1\), `abort` remains `False` if `flag` does not equal \(-(8n - 4) - 1\) and does not equal \(8n - 3\), `index` is `[16n - 8]`, `flag` is assigned the value at index \(8n - 3\) of the `nodes` list.**
