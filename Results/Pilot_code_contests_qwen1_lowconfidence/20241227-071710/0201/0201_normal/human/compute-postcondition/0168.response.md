According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in `new_nodes`. At the end of the previous iteration, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`, where `p` is the last value processed in the previous iteration.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. The variable `p` will take the next value from `new_nodes` in the current iteration.
2. For the loop to execute again, `p` must be a valid element in `new_nodes`.

Let's assume the last value of `p` was `p_last` (the last value processed in the previous iteration). For the loop to continue, `p` needs to be the next value in `new_nodes`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `p` will be the next value in `new_nodes` after `p_last`.
- Consequently, `nodes[p + 1]` will be checked, and it should be initialized or set appropriately for the next iteration.

Since the exact value of `p_last` is not specified, let's denote the next value of `p` as `p_next`.

State: **`nodes[p_next + 1]` is uninitialized or -1, where `p_next` is the next value in `new_nodes` after `p_last`**.
