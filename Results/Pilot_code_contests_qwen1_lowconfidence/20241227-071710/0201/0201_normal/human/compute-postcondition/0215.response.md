To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the `while True` loop.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `4 * n - 3`.
- `new_nodes` is a list containing one element `(4 * n - 3) * 2`.
- `abort` remains `True` if `flag` equals `-1`; otherwise, `abort` remains `False`.
- `index` is less than or equal to 0.
- `c` is an integer.
- `p` is `0`.
- `flag` is `-1` if `flag` equals `-1`; otherwise, `flag` is `1`.

### Analysis of the `while True` Loop:
- The `while True` loop runs indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of the loop.

### Conditions for Continuing the Loop:
Since the loop is `while True`, the loop will continue to execute as long as no explicit break statement is encountered within the loop. There are no conditions in the loop header itself that affect the continuation of the loop. Therefore, we need to focus on any changes or adjustments that might prevent the loop from continuing if they occur inside the loop.

### Possible Adjustments:
Given the current states and the nature of the `while True` loop, no specific states need to be modified for the loop to execute one more time because the loop will continue to run indefinitely unless there is an internal break condition or similar mechanism.

### Conclusion:
No states need to be adjusted specifically for the `while True` loop to execute one more time.

### Final Answer:
State: **No adjustments needed**
