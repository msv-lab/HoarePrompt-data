The code `lookup[v] = storage_index` updates the value of `lookup[v]` to `storage_index`. Let's break down the changes:

- Initially, `storage[storage_index]` is equal to `lookup[v]`.
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` is equal to `u`.
- `lookup[u]` is equal to `storage_index - 2`.
- `storage_index` is updated to `storage_index + 2`.

After executing `lookup[v] = storage_index`, the new state is:
- `storage[storage_index]` is still equal to `lookup[v]` (now `lookup[v]` is equal to `storage_index`).
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` is still equal to `u`.
- `lookup[u]` is still equal to `storage_index - 2`.
- `storage_index` is now equal to `storage_index + 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`storage[storage_index]` is equal to `lookup[v]` (which is now `storage_index`); `storage[storage_index + 1]` is equal to `u`; `lookup[u]` is equal to `storage_index - 2`; `storage_index` is equal to `storage_index + 2`.**
