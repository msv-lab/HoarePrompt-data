The code `nodes[p + 1] = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the element at the index `p + 1` in the list `nodes`. Since this is the only change made, the other variables remain unaffected. The initial state was that `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`, which is now confirmed after the assignment.

Output State: **`nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`**
