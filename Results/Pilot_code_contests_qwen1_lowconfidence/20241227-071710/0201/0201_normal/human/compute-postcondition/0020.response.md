The code `storage_index += 2` increments the value of `storage_index` by 2. From the initial state, we know that `storage_index` was `storage_index + 6`. After executing this line, the new value of `storage_index` will be `(storage_index + 6) + 2`, which simplifies to `storage_index + 8`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index + 4`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index + 4`, `lookup[v]` is `storage_index`, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 8`**
