According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `new_nodes`. The loop will execute if `new_nodes` contains at least one element. At the end of the previous iteration, `new_nodes` must contain at least one element, `p` is 1, `abort` is `True`, and `nodes[1]` is `-1`, `nodes[2]` is `-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `new_nodes` must still contain at least one element. The value of `p` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2. Since we don't know the exact contents of `new_nodes` at the start of the next iteration, we only need to ensure that it still contains at least one element.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one element, `p` is 2, `abort` is `True`, and `nodes[1]` is `-1`, `nodes[2]` is `-1`**
