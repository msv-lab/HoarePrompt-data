Let's break down the given Python code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `storage[storage_index]` is equal to the next `lookup[v]`
   - `storage[storage_index + 1]` is equal to the next `u`
   - `lookup[u]` is equal to `storage_index - 2`
   - `storage_index` is equal to `storage_index + 4`

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   storage[storage_index] = lookup[u]
   ```

3. Analyzing the impact:
   - `storage[storage_index]` is being updated to the value of `lookup[u]`.
   - `storage[storage_index + 1]` and `lookup[u]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
   - `lookup[u]` is initially set to `storage_index - 2`.
   - `storage_index` was supposed to be updated to `storage_index + 4`, but this assignment was not executed due to the code snippet provided.

4. Updating the values:
   - Since `storage[storage_index]` is now updated to `lookup[u]`, and `lookup[u]` is `storage_index - 2`, we have `storage[storage_index]` now equals `storage_index - 2`.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `storage[storage_index]` is now `storage_index - 2`
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` remains as the next `u`
- `lookup[u]` remains as `storage_index - 2`
- `storage_index` remains as `storage_index + 4` (though it wasn't executed, the intention is noted)

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index - 2`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is the next `u`, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index - 2`, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 4`.**
