`nodes[p + 1]` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `new_nodes` is not specified in the code snippet, but it is mentioned that it must contain at least one element, which remains unchanged. Therefore, the only updated variable is `nodes[p + 1]`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one element, `nodes[p + 1]` is 1**
