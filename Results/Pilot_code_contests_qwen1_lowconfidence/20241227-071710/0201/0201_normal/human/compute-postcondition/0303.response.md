The code `p = index * 2` updates the value of `p`. Given the initial state, `p` is defined as `index * 2` if `index > 0` else `(n-1) * 2`. After executing `p = index * 2`, `p` will be set to `index * 2`. 

If `index <= 0`, the code would break out of the most internal loop or match-case statement, but since the assignment to `p` is done regardless of the condition, this break statement does not affect the current step.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `new_nodes` remains `[n-1] * 2, p`
- `p` is now `index * 2`
- `abort` remains either `True` or `False` depending on the value of `nodes[p + 1]`
- `c` remains unknown
- `nodes` remains unchanged
- `count` remains 0
- `i` remains `n-1`
- `index` remains `nodes[p]`
- `flag` remains `nodes[p + 1]`

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[n-1] * 2, index * 2`, `p` is `index * 2`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on the value of `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`, `c` is unknown, `nodes` is unchanged, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `index` is `nodes[index * 2]`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`**
