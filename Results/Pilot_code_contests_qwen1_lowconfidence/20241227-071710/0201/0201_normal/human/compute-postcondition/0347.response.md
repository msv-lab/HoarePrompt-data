Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the output state after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State Recap
- `new_nodes` is a list of values.
- `p` is the final value.
- `abort` is `True`.
- `c` is `-len(new_nodes)`.
- `nodes` is unchanged.
- `count` is 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks.
- `c` is less than 0.

### Loop Code
```
for j in xrange(-c):
    nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1
```

### Analysis of the Loop
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs `c` times (since `c` is `-len(new_nodes)` and `j` starts from `-c` and increments by 1 each iteration).
2. **Effect of Each Iteration**:
   - On each iteration, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is set to `-1`.
   - The index `new_nodes[j] + 1` ensures that the node at position `new_nodes[j] + 1` in the `nodes` list is marked as `-1`.

### Final State After All Iterations
- Since the loop runs `c` times, which is equal to `-len(new_nodes)`, it means the loop will run exactly `len(new_nodes)` times.
- Therefore, `nodes[new_nodes[0] + 1], nodes[new_nodes[1] + 1], ..., nodes[new_nodes[len(new_nodes) - 1] + 1]` will all be set to `-1`.

### Variables After the Loop
- `new_nodes`: Remains unchanged as the loop does not modify it.
- `p`: Remains unchanged as the loop does not modify it.
- `abort`: Remains `True` as the loop does not change it.
- `c`: Remains `-len(new_nodes)` since it is not modified within the loop.
- `nodes`: The elements at positions `new_nodes[0] + 1, new_nodes[1] + 1, ..., new_nodes[len(new_nodes) - 1] + 1` are set to `-1`.
- `count`: Remains `0` as the loop does not modify it.
- `i`: Remains `n-1` as the loop does not modify it.
- `index`: Remains the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks as the loop does not modify it.
- `j`: The last value of `j` will be `len(new_nodes) - 1` after the loop finishes.

### Conclusion
After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state is:
- `new_nodes` is a list of values.
- `p` is the final value.
- `abort` is `True`.
- `c` is `-len(new_nodes)`.
- `nodes` is unchanged except for the elements at positions `new_nodes[0] + 1, new_nodes[1] + 1, ..., new_nodes[len(new_nodes) - 1] + 1` being set to `-1`.
- `count` is `0`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks.
- `j` is `len(new_nodes) - 1`.
- `len(new_nodes)` must be greater than 0.

### Output State
Output State: **`new_nodes` is a list of values, `p` is the final value, `abort` is `True`, `c` is `-len(new_nodes)`, `nodes` is unchanged except for the elements at positions `new_nodes[0] + 1, new_nodes[1] + 1, ..., new_nodes[len(new_nodes) - 1] + 1` being set to `-1`, `count` is `0`, `i` is `n-1`, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks, `j` is `len(new_nodes) - 1`, `len(new_nodes)` must be greater than 0.**
