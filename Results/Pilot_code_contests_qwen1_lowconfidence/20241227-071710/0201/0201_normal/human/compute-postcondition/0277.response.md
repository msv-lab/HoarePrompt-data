`flag` is assigned the value of `nodes[p + 1]`. Given that `p` is `(n-1) * 2`, `flag` will be `nodes[(n-1) * 2 + 1]`. The value of `c` is unknown and is not affected by this line of code. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is `(n-1) * 2`, `abort` is `False`, `c` is unknown, `nodes` is unchanged, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `flag` is `nodes[(n-1) * 2 + 1]`**
