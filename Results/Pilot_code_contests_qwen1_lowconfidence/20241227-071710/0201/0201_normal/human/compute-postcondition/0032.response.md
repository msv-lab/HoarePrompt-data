The code initializes a stack with the value of `n`. The variable `stack` is now a list containing `[n]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is `4 * n - 4`, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with all elements set to 0, `stack` is `[n]`.**
