`lookup[u]` is assigned the value of `storage_index`. The value of `storage[storage_index]` remains equal to `lookup[u]`, and the value of `storage[storage_index + 1]` remains equal to `v`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is equal to `lookup[u]`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is equal to `v`, `lookup[u]` is equal to `storage_index`**
