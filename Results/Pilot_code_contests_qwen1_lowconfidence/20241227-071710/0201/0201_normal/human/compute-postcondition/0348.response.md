Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is a list of values, `p` is the final value, `abort` is `True`, `nodes` is unchanged (except potentially at positions specified in the else part), `count` is `0`, `i` is `n-1`, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks. If `c >= 0`, `new_nodes` contains only one element and `nodes[p + 1]` is `1`. Otherwise, `new_nodes` is a list of values, `nodes[new_nodes[0] + 1], nodes[new_nodes[1] + 1], ..., nodes[new_nodes[len(new_nodes) - 1] + 1]` are set to `-1`, and the length of `new_nodes` is greater than `0`.***
