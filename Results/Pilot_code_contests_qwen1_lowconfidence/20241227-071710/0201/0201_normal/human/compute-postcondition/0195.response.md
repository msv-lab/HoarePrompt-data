Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `4 * n - 2`.
   - `new_nodes` is a list.
   - `abort` is a boolean.
   - `index` is an integer.
   - `c` is an integer.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates from `n` to 1 (inclusive) in steps of -1. Therefore, the loop condition is `i` should be greater than 0.

3. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `4 * n - 2`.

4. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 0.
   - Since `i` is currently `4 * n - 2`, we need to check if `4 * n - 2 > 0`. This simplifies to `n > 0.5`. Given that `n` is greater than 0, this condition is always true.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - After decrementing `i` by 1, `i` will become `4 * n - 3`.
   - The values of `new_nodes`, `abort`, `index`, and `c` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them.

6. **Updated State:**
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `i` becomes `4 * n - 3`.
   - `new_nodes`, `abort`, `index`, and `c` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `4 * n - 3`, `new_nodes` is a list, `abort` is a boolean, `index` is an integer, and `c` is an integer.**
