According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `new_nodes` list. The condition for the loop to execute again depends on the value of `p`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`. For the loop to execute again, `p` must be a valid index in `new_nodes`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue:**
   - The loop continues as long as `p` is a valid index in `new_nodes`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - Since `p` must be an index in `new_nodes`, we need to identify the next possible value for `p`.
   - Given that `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1` at the end of the previous iteration, `p` was the last index processed.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `p` must be the next index in `new_nodes` such that `nodes[p + 1]` remains `-1`.

State: **`nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`, `p` must be the next index in `new_nodes`**
