The code updates the value of `p` to `index * 2`. Given the initial state where `index` is `nodes[p] * 2`, we substitute this into the new assignment:

- Initially, `p` is equal to `nodes[p] * 2`.
- After the code runs, `p` is updated to `index * 2`, which is `(nodes[p] * 2) * 2`.

Therefore, the new value of `p` is `nodes[p] * 4`.

The other variables (`flag`, `new_nodes`, `index`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`flag` is equal to `nodes[p + 1]`, `new_nodes` contains the original elements plus `p` and includes `nodes[p] * 2`, `index` is `nodes[p] * 2`, and `p` is `nodes[p] * 4`.**
