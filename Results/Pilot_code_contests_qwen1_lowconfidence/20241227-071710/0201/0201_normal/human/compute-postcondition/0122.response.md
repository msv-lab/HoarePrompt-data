Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The given loop is `while True`, which means the loop will always execute as long as the loop body does not change the termination condition.

2. **Determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - Since the loop is `while True`, there are no conditions that need to be checked within the loop itself. The loop will execute indefinitely unless explicitly stopped from within the loop.

3. **Check the provided state**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is set to `4 * n - 2`.
   - `new_nodes` is an empty list.
   - `p` is set to `(4 * n - 2) * 2`.
   - `abort` is False.

4. **Verify if any adjustments are needed**:
   - There are no conditions in the loop that depend on `i`, `new_nodes`, `p`, or `abort` to determine whether the loop should execute.
   - The only variable `n` is required to be greater than 0, but this is already satisfied based on the provided state.

Since the loop is `while True`, it will execute indefinitely as long as the loop body does not change the termination condition. Therefore, no additional state adjustments are needed.

**Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 4 * n - 2, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is (4 * n - 2) * 2, `abort` is False**
