`nodes[v * 2]` is assigned the value of `index`. Given that `index` is the new value of the last element in the stack (which was `n`), `nodes[v * 2]` becomes `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`
- `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`
- `lookup[v]` is undefined
- `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`
- `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[u * 2]` set to `n` and all other elements set to 0, and now `nodes[v * 2]` is also set to `n`
- `stack` now contains one less occurrence of `u`
- `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`
- `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`
- `index` is the new value of the last element in the stack (which is `n`)
- `parent_index` is `n`
- `v` is `u`
- `nodes[u * 2]` is `n`
- `t` is `4 * n - 2`

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[u * 2]` and `nodes[v * 2]` set to `n` and all other elements set to 0, `stack` now contains one less occurrence of `u`, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is `n`, `parent_index` is `n`, `v` is `u`, `nodes[u * 2]` is `n`, `t` is `4 * n - 2`**
