The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the loop or the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, it would exit the loop or if statement that it is in. Since there is no loop or if statement specified, the only impact is that the execution would break out of such a structure. All other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 4 * `n` - 2, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is (4 * `n` - 2) * 2, `abort` is True, `flag` is nodes[(4 * `n` - 2) * 2 + 1], and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
