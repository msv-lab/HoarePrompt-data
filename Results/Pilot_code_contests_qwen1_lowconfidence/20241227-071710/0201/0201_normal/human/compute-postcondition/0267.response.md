The code `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` updates the value of `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` to `-1`. Given that `j` is `0`, this translates to updating `nodes[new_nodes[0] + 1]` to `-1`. According to the initial state, `nodes[new_nodes[0] + 1]` is already `-1`, so no change occurs.

Output State: **`nodes[new_nodes[0] + 1]` is -1, `j` is 0**
