Output State: **`nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `nodes[p_next + 1]` is uninitialized or -1, `index` is the last valid value of `index` before the loop breaks or all elements in `new_nodes` are exhausted, `abort` is `True`, `i` is 4 * `n` - 2, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p, p, ...]` with each element following the pattern until no further valid `p` can be found.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution and Pattern:**
   - The loop iterates over the `new_nodes` list and sets `nodes[p + 1]` to -1 for each `p` in `new_nodes`.
   - After each iteration, `p` is updated to the next valid value in `new_nodes`.

2. **Final State Analysis:**
   - If the loop executes fully, it will set `nodes[p + 1]` to -1 for all valid `p` values in `new_nodes`.
   - Once all elements in `new_nodes` are exhausted, the loop will break, leaving `nodes[p + 1]` set to -1 for the last valid `p` and `nodes[p_next + 1]` (if any) either uninitialized or -1.
   - Since the loop does not modify `abort`, `index`, `i`, or `new_nodes` during its execution, these variables retain their original values.
   
3. **Non-Execution Case:**
   - If the loop does not execute (e.g., because `new_nodes` is empty), the values of `nodes`, `index`, `abort`, `i`, and `new_nodes` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Thus, the final state of the program after all iterations of the loop have finished, or after the loop breaks, is as described above.
