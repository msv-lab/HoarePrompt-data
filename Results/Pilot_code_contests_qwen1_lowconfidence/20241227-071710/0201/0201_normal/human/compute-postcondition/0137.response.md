The code assigns `index * 2` to `p`. Given that `index` is equal to `[p]` and its current value is less than or equal to 0, `index * 2` would be a list containing the element `2 * [p]`. However, since `index` is a list and we are multiplying it by 2, this operation will not produce a scalar value but rather a new list where each element is doubled.

The initial state of `index` being less than or equal to 0 means that the new list `index` will contain the element `2 * [p]`. Since the initial value of `index` is `[p]`, the new value of `index` will be `[2 * p]`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the given code snippet. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 4 * `n` - 2, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[p]`, `p` is (4 * `n` - 2) * 2, `abort` remains True if `flag` equals -1, and `abort` remains False if `flag` does not equal -1 and does not equal (4 * `n` - 2) * 2 + 1, `index` is `[2 * p]`**.
