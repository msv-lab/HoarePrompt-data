Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is -1

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `-c` to `0` (inclusive).

3. **Current Value of `j`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` must have been the value that caused `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` to be -1.

4. **Next Value of `j`:**
   - Since the loop increments `j` towards 0 (or decreases it if `j` was positive), the next value of `j` would be `j + 1`.
   - If `j` was `-1`, then the next value would be `0`.

5. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute again if `j` is within the range of `-c` to `0`.

6. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - We need to ensure that `j` is set to its new value, which is `0` if `j` was `-1`.
   - The condition `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` should still hold true for the next iteration, but since we are moving to the next `j`, we need to check the corresponding element in the `nodes` array for `j = 0`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `j` is now `0`.
- The condition `nodes[new_nodes[0] + 1]` must be checked, but since the problem does not specify the value of `new_nodes[0]`, we only know that the loop will continue as long as `j` is within the specified range.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`nodes[new_nodes[0] + 1]` is -1, `j` is 0**
