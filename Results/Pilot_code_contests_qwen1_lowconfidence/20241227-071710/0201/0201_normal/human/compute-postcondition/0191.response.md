Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `4 * n - 2`
   - `abort` is `True`
   - `index` is the last valid value of `index` before the loop breaks or all elements in `new_nodes` are exhausted
   - `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)` and must be less than 0
   - `new_nodes` must have at least `-c` elements
   - `nodes` has an additional value `-1` at the index specified by `new_nodes[-c] + 1`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for j in xrange(-c):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `j = -c` to `j = -1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to the next value, which would be `j = -c + 1`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `j` starts at `-c` and increments by 1 each iteration, the new state should reflect this.
   - The variable `abort` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but it is given as `True` and no change is expected here.
   - The variable `index` remains unchanged as the loop does not affect it directly.
   - The variable `c` remains unchanged as the loop does not affect it directly.
   - The variable `new_nodes` and its length remain unchanged as the loop does not affect it directly.
   - The variable `nodes` remains unchanged as the loop does not affect it directly.

5. **Final State Before the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` remains `4 * n - 2`
   - `abort` remains `True`
   - `index` remains the same
   - `c` remains the same
   - `new_nodes` remains the same
   - `nodes` remains the same

**State:**
**`i` is `4 * n - 2`, `abort` is `True`, `index` is the last valid value of `index` before the loop breaks or all elements in `new_nodes` are exhausted, `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)` and must be less than 0, `new_nodes` must have at least `-c` elements, `nodes` has an additional value `-1` at the index specified by `new_nodes[-c] + 1`, `j` is `-c + 1`**
