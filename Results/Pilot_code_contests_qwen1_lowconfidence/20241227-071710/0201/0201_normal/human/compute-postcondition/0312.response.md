The code updates the value of `index` to `nodes[p]`. Initially, `p` is set to `index * 2`. Given this, `index` will be updated to `nodes[index * 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state will be:

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[n-1] * 2, index * 2, index * 2`, `p` is `index * 2`, `c` is unknown, `nodes` is unchanged, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `index` is `nodes[index * 2]`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 2]`, and `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on the value of `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`.**
