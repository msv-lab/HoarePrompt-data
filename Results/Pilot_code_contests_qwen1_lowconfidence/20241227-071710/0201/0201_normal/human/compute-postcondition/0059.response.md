The code `nodes[v * 2] = index` assigns the value of `index` to the element at position `v * 2` in the list `nodes`. Given the initial state:

- `storage[t + 1]` is assigned to `v`, meaning `v` holds the value of `storage[t + 1]`.
- `t` is the value of `storage[t + 1]`.
- If `v` equals `parent_index`, then no change occurs, otherwise, the assignment happens.

Since `v` is assigned the value of `storage[t + 1]`, and the code assigns `index` to `nodes[v * 2]`, the value of `nodes[v * 2]` changes to `index`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage[t + 1]` is assigned to `v`, `t` is the value of `storage[t + 1]`; `nodes[v * 2]` is now `index`.**
