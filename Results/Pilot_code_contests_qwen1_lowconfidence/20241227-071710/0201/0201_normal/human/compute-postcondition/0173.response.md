`c` is assigned the value of `count - len(new_nodes)`. The previous values of `count` and `new_nodes` are not explicitly given, but the length of `new_nodes` is subtracted from `count` to calculate `c`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `4 * n - 2`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p, p, ...]` with each element following the pattern until no further valid `p` can be found, `abort` is `True`, `index` is the last valid value of `index` before the loop breaks or all elements in `new_nodes` are exhausted, `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`**
