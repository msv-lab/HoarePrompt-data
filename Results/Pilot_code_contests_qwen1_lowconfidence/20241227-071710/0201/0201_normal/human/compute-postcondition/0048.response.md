The code `v = storage[t + 1]` assigns the value at index `t + 1` in the `storage` list to the variable `v`. Given the initial state, `storage[t + 1]` is `u` because `t` is the same as `storage_index`, which is `8 * n - 4`. So, `v` is assigned the value `u`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:
**`storage[storage_index]` is `u`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with all elements set to 0, `stack` now contains `v`, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is `n`, `parent_index` is `0`, `t` must be non-negative (i.e., `u` must be non-negative), `v` is `u`, and `nodes[v * 2]` is `n`.**

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `u`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with all elements set to 0, `stack` now contains `u`, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is `n`, `parent_index` is `0`, `t` must be non-negative (i.e., `u` must be non-negative), `v` is `u`, and `nodes[u * 2]` is `n`.**
