The code snippet updates the value of `nodes[v * 2]` to be equal to `index`. Before the update, `nodes[v * 2]` is `u + 4 * n - 2`. After the update, `nodes[v * 2]` becomes `index`.

The variable `v` is the value at index `t + 1` in the `storage` list, and it remains unchanged. The variable `parent_index` is not directly involved in this update, so its value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, and `v` is the value at index `t + 1` in the `storage` list. If `v` equals `parent_index`, the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains unchanged.**
