Output State: **`new_nodes` is a list containing only one element, `nodes[p + 1]` is 1, `abort` is `True`, `c` is 0, `nodes` is unchanged except for the updated value at index `p + 1`, `count` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in `new_nodes`. For each iteration, it sets `nodes[p + 1]` to 1.
- After the loop finishes executing, `new_nodes` must contain exactly one element (since the loop can only execute if `new_nodes` is not empty, and it continues until `new_nodes` is exhausted).
- Once the loop completes, `nodes[p + 1]` will be set to 1 for the single remaining element `p` in `new_nodes`.
- All other variables (`abort`, `c`, `nodes` (except for the updated index), `count`, `i`, and `index`) remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
