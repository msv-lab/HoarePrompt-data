According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p` and the list `new_nodes`. The loop will continue as long as `new_nodes` contains at least one element and `p` is within the bounds of `new_nodes`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `new_nodes` contains at least one element.
- `abort` is `False`.
- `p` is the next element in `new_nodes`.
- `nodes[p + 1]` is `1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must hold:
1. `new_nodes` must still contain at least one element.
2. `p` should be updated to the next element in `new_nodes`.

Since we are starting a new iteration, we assume `p` will be the next element in `new_nodes`. Also, `new_nodes` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `new_nodes` must still contain at least one element.
- `abort` remains `False`.
- `p` will be the next element in `new_nodes`.
- The condition `nodes[p + 1]` is `1` is not explicitly required to be maintained for the next iteration (since it was true for the current iteration, and the loop continues as long as `new_nodes` is not empty).

State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one element, `abort` is `False`, `p` will be the next element in `new_nodes`**
