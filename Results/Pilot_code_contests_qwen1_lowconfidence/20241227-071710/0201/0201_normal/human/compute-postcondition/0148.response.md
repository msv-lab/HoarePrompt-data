Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0; `i` is \(4 \times n - 2\); `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p]`; `abort` remains `True` if `flag` equals \(-(8n - 4) - 1\), `abort` remains `False` if `flag` does not equal \(-(8n - 4) - 1\) and does not equal \(8n - 3\); `index` is now `nodes[p]`; `flag` is assigned the value at index \(8n - 3\) of the `nodes` list. Since the else part is not provided, the postcondition remains as per the if condition.***
