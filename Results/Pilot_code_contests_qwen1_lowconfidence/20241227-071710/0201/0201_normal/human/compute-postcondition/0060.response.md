`stack_append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the stack. The value of `v` is assigned from `storage[t + 1]`. Therefore, the stack now contains the value of `storage[t + 1]`.

The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. The initial conditions remain true, except for the stack which now includes the value of `storage[t + 1]`.

Output State: **`storage[t + 1]` is assigned to `v`, `t` is the value of `storage[t + 1]`; `nodes[v * 2]` is now `index`; the stack contains the value of `storage[t + 1]`.**
