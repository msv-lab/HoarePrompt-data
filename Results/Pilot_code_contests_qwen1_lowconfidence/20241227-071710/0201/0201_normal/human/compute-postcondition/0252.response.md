Let's break down the given state and the for loop to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given State:
- `new_nodes` contains all the elements appended during the loop.
- `p` is the last index of `new_nodes` (or -1 if `new_nodes` is empty).
- `abort` is `True` if any `flag` at `p + 1` was `-1` when the loop stopped, otherwise `abort` is `False`.
- `nodes` is updated such that for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`.
- `c` is greater than or equal to 0.

### For Loop:
```
for p in new_nodes:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over each element `p` in `new_nodes`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `new_nodes` must contain at least one element. This means `new_nodes` should not be empty.

2. **Variable Adjustments**:
   - `new_nodes` must have at least one element. If `new_nodes` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - `p` is automatically set to the last index of `new_nodes` or -1 if `new_nodes` is empty within the loop.
   - The state of `abort` and `nodes` will be determined within the loop based on the conditions inside the loop body, which we don't know yet.
   - `c` being greater than or equal to 0 is not directly related to the loop execution but may be used elsewhere in the code.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute, the primary state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring `new_nodes` contains at least one element.

### Final Answer:
State: **`new_nodes` must have at least one element, `p` is the last index of `new_nodes` or -1 if `new_nodes` is empty, `abort` and `nodes` will be updated within the loop, `c` is greater than or equal to 0**.
