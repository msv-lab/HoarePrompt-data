The variable `abort` is assigned the value `True`, which means the program will abort the current operation. The values of the other variables (`flag`, `new_nodes`, `index`, and `p`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`flag` is equal to `nodes[p + 1]`, `new_nodes` contains the original elements plus `p`, `index` is `nodes[p]`, `p` is `nodes[p] * 2`, and `abort` is `True`.**
