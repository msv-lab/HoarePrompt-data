Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from `-c` to 0 (exclusive). This means the loop will run as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0.

2. **Current States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `i` is `4 * n - 2`
   - `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p, p, ...]` with each element following the pattern until no further valid `p` can be found
   - `abort` is `True`
   - `index` is the last valid value of `index` before the loop breaks or all elements in `new_nodes` are exhausted
   - `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)` and must be less than 0
   - `new_nodes` must have at least `-c` elements
   - `nodes` has an additional value `-1` at the index specified by `new_nodes[j] + 1`

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be greater than or equal to 0. Since `j` starts from `-c` and goes up to 0, it will continue if `j` is still within this range.
   - Since `c` is less than 0, `-c` is a positive number. Therefore, the loop will run for `j = -c`.

4. **Update the States**:
   - `i` remains the same as `4 * n - 2` since the loop variable `i` is not involved in the loop condition.
   - `abort` remains `True` unless explicitly changed inside the loop.
   - `index` remains the same as it was the last valid value before the loop broke.
   - `c` remains `count - len(new_nodes)` and is still less than 0.
   - `new_nodes` remains the same list unless elements are added or removed inside the loop.
   - `nodes` will have an additional value `-1` at the index specified by `new_nodes[j] + 1` for the new value of `j`.

Given these points, the updated states for the next iteration are:

- `i` is `4 * n - 2`
- `abort` is `True`
- `index` is the last valid value of `index` before the loop breaks or all elements in `new_nodes` are exhausted
- `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)` and must be less than 0
- `new_nodes` must have at least `-c` elements
- `nodes` has an additional value `-1` at the index specified by `new_nodes[-c] + 1`

Thus, the final state is:

**State: `i` is `4 * n - 2`, `abort` is `True`, `index` is the last valid value of `index` before the loop breaks or all elements in `new_nodes` are exhausted, `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)` and must be less than 0, `new_nodes` must have at least `-c` elements, `nodes` has an additional value `-1` at the index specified by `new_nodes[-c] + 1`**.
