The code `abort = False` assigns the value `False` to the variable `abort`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `new_nodes`, or `p`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 4 * n - 2, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is (4 * n - 2) * 2, `abort` is False**
