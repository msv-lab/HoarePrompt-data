According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `new_nodes`. For the loop to execute again, `new_nodes` must contain at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `new_nodes` must contain at least one element.
- `nodes[p + 1]` is 1, where `p` is the value of the last element processed in the loop.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The variable `p` must be set to the first element in `new_nodes`.
- `nodes[p + 1]` will then be evaluated for the new value of `p`.

Let's assume that `new_nodes` contains elements starting from index 0 (since it must contain at least one element). Therefore, the first element in `new_nodes` would be used as the new value for `p`.

State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one element, `p` is set to the first element in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` must be valid for the new value of `p`**
