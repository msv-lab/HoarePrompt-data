`nodes[p + 1]` is assigned the value `-1`. The value of `p_next + 1` was either uninitialized or `-1` before the execution of the code. After executing the code, `nodes[p + 1]` is now `-1`. The value of `p_next + 1` remains unchanged because it was not directly affected by the assignment operation.

Output State: **`nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `nodes[p_next + 1]` is uninitialized or -1**
