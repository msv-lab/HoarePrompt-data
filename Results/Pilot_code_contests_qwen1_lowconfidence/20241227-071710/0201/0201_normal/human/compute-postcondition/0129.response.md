The code `break` does not change any variable values; it only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no loop or conditional statement is mentioned in the code snippet provided, the only effect is that we break out of the current loop or conditional context.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 4 * n - 2, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is (4 * n - 2) * 2, `abort` is False, `flag` is not (4 * n - 2) * 2 + 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
