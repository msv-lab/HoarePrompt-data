The code `new_nodes.append(p)` appends the value of `p` to the list `new_nodes`. Given the initial state, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is `(n-1) * 2`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on the value of `flag`, `c` is unknown, `nodes` is unchanged, `count` is 0, and `i` is `n-1`.

Since `new_nodes` is initially an empty list and `p` is `(n-1) * 2`, after appending `p` to `new_nodes`, `new_nodes` will contain `[p]` which is `[n-1] * 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[n-1] * 2`, `p` is `(n-1) * 2`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on the value of `flag`, `c` is unknown, `nodes` is unchanged, `count` is 0, and `i` is `n-1`**
