The code assigns the value of `index * 2` to `p`. Here, `index` is `nodes[p]`, which was derived from the value at index \(8n - 3\) in the `nodes` list. Since `index` itself is not explicitly defined as a numerical value, it is kept as `nodes[p]` in the output state. All other variables remain unchanged except for `p`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is \(4 \times n - 2\)
- `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p]`
- `abort` remains `True` if `flag` equals \(-(8n - 4) - 1\), `abort` remains `False` if `flag` does not equal \(-(8n - 4) - 1\) and does not equal \(8n - 3\)
- `index` is `nodes[p]`
- `flag` is assigned the value at index \(8n - 3\) of the `nodes` list

After the code runs, `p` is updated to `index * 2`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is \(4 \times n - 2\); `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p]`; `abort` remains `True` if `flag` equals \(-(8n - 4) - 1\), `abort` remains `False` if `flag` does not equal \(-(8n - 4) - 1\) and does not equal \(8n - 3\); `index` is `nodes[p]`; `flag` is assigned the value at index \(8n - 3\) of the `nodes` list; `p` is `index * 2`.**
