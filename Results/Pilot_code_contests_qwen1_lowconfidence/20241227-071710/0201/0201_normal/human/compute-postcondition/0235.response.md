The code `index = nodes[p]` simply reassigns the value of `index` to be the same as `nodes[p]`. According to the initial state, `index` is already equal to `nodes[p] * 2`. Therefore, after executing this line, `index` will still be equal to `nodes[p] * 2`.

The other variables (`flag`, `new_nodes`, and `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`flag` is equal to `nodes[p + 1]`, `new_nodes` contains the original elements plus `p` and includes `nodes[p] * 2`, `index` is `nodes[p] * 2`, and `p` is `nodes[p] * 2`**
