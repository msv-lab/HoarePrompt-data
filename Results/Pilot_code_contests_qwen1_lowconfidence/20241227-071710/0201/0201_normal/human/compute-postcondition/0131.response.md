Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 4 * `n` - 2, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is (4 * `n` - 2) * 2, `abort` is True if `flag` equals -1, and `abort` remains False if `flag` does not equal -1 and does not equal (4 * `n` - 2) * 2 + 1. If `flag` equals 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
