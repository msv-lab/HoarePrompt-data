According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p` and the list `new_nodes`. For the loop to execute again, `p` must be an element of `new_nodes` and `new_nodes` must have at least 1 element (as it did in the previous iteration).

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `new_nodes` must have at least 1 element.
- `nodes[nodes[new_nodes[0]] + 1]` is `-1`.
- `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`.

For the loop to execute again, `p` must be an element of `new_nodes`. Since `new_nodes` must still have at least 1 element, the condition `nodes[nodes[new_nodes[0]] + 1]` is `-1` remains unchanged, and `nodes[p + 1]` being `-1` also remains unchanged.

State: **`new_nodes` must have at least 1 element, `nodes[nodes[new_nodes[0]] + 1]` is `-1`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`**
