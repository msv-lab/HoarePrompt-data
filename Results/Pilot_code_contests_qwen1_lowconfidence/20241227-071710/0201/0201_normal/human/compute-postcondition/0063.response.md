The code `index = stack_pop()` pops the last element from the `stack` and assigns it to `index`. Before the pop operation, `index` was `n`. After popping, `index` will be updated to the new value of the last element in the stack, which was `n`.

The output state after executing the code will be:
- `storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`
- `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`
- `lookup[v]` is undefined
- `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`
- `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[u * 2]` set to `n` and all other elements set to 0
- `stack` now contains one less occurrence of `u` (since `n` was popped)
- `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`
- `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`
- `index` is the new value of the last element in the stack (which was `n`)
- `parent_index` is `0`
- `t` is a negative number
- `v` is `u`
- `nodes[u * 2]` is `n`

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[u * 2]` set to `n` and all other elements set to 0, `stack` now contains one less occurrence of `u`, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is the new value of the last element in the stack (which was `n`), `parent_index` is `0`, `t` is a negative number, `v` is `u`, and `nodes[u * 2]` is `n`.
