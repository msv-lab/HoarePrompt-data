Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` contains all the elements appended during the loop, `p` is 0, `abort` is `True` if `flag` at `p + 1` was `-1` when the loop stopped, otherwise `abort` is `False`, and `index` is non-positive. The current value of `abort` is `True` since the if condition checks if `abort` is `True`.***
