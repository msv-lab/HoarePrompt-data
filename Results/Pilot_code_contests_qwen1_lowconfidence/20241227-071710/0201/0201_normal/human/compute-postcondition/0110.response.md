`t` is assigned the value of `storage[t]`. The value of `t` before this assignment was greater than or equal to 0. Since `t` is now set to `storage[t]`, the exact value of `t` depends on the value stored in `storage[t]`. However, we know that `storage[t]` must also be a non-negative integer because `t` was initially greater than or equal to 0.

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `v` is the new value at `storage[t + 1]`, `t` is now `storage[t]`**
