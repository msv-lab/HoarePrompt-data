The code `stack_append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the `stack`. Given the initial state, `v` is defined as `storage[4 * n - 1]`, which means `v` is `storage[4 * n - 1]`.

After executing this line, the value of `v` is appended to the `stack`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `u`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with all elements set to 0, `stack` now contains `v`, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is `n`, `parent_index` is `0`, `t` is `u`, `v` is `storage[4 * n - 1]`, and `nodes[v * 2]` is `n`.
