The code reads from `sys.stdin` and creates a list of tuples `edges` containing integers representing the districts connected by paths. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `n` and `k`, and these values do not change, the only variable that changes is `edges`. 

The impact of the code is that `edges` is now populated with tuples read from standard input. The number of tuples will be `n - 1` as specified.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are specific integers such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n` ≤ 10^6, `edges` is a list of `n - 1` tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the districts connected by a path.**
