The code `new_nodes.append(p)` appends the value of `p` to the list `new_nodes`. Based on the initial state:

- `new_nodes` is `[n-1] * 2`
- `p` is `index * 2` if `index > 0` else `(n-1) * 2`
- `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on the value of `nodes[p + 1]`
- `c` is unknown
- `nodes` is unchanged
- `count` is 0
- `i` is `n-1`
- `index` is `nodes[p]`
- `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`

After executing `new_nodes.append(p)`, the value of `new_nodes` will become `[n-1] * 2, p`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`new_nodes` is `[n-1] * 2, p`, `p` is `index * 2` if `index > 0` else `(n-1) * 2`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on the value of `nodes[p + 1]`, `c` is unknown, `nodes` is unchanged, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `index` is `nodes[p]`, `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`.**
