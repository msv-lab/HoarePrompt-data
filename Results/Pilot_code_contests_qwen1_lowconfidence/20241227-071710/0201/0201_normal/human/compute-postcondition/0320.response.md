Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `new_nodes` must have at least 1 element.
- `nodes[nodes[new_nodes[0]] + 1]` is `-1`.

### Loop Information:
```
for p in new_nodes:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each element `p` in `new_nodes`.
2. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `new_nodes` has at least one element, and `nodes[nodes[new_nodes[0]] + 1]` is `-1`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

1. **Element Removal from `new_nodes`**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over elements of `new_nodes`, one element `p` from `new_nodes` is being processed.
   - Therefore, `new_nodes` will have one fewer element after this iteration.

2. **Updating the Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `new_nodes` must still have at least one element.
   - After removing one element from `new_nodes`, it must still have at least one element, meaning it had at least 2 elements before this iteration.

3. **Updating the Specific Condition**:
   - The specific condition involving `nodes` and `new_nodes` is `nodes[nodes[new_nodes[0]] + 1]` is `-1`.
   - This condition is evaluated using the first element of `new_nodes`, which is now the second element (since we removed one element).

### Final State:
- `new_nodes` must have at least 1 element (originally had at least 2 elements).
- `nodes[nodes[new_nodes[0]] + 1]` is still `-1`.

Thus, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`new_nodes` must have at least 1 element, `nodes[nodes[new_nodes[0]] + 1]` is `-1`**
