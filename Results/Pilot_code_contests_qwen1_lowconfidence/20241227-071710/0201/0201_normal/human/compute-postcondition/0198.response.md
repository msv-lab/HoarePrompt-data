The variable `abort` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `new_nodes`, `index`, `c`, `p`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `4 * n - 3`; `new_nodes` is an empty list; `abort` is `False`; `index` is an integer; `c` is an integer; `p` is `(4 * n - 3) * 2`**
