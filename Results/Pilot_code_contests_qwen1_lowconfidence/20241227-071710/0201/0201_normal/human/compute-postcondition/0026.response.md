The code `storage[storage_index] = lookup[v]` updates the value of `storage[storage_index]` to the value of `lookup[v]`. From the initial state, we know that `lookup[v]` is `storage_index + 10`.

Therefore, the updated value of `storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index + 10`.

- The value of `storage[storage_index + 1]` remains unchanged and is still `v`.
- The value of `lookup[u]` remains unchanged and is still `storage_index + 10`.
- The value of `lookup[v]` remains unchanged and is still `storage_index + 8`.
- The value of `storage_index` remains unchanged and is still `storage_index + 12`.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index + 10`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `v`, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index + 10`, `lookup[v]` is `storage_index + 8`, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 12`**
