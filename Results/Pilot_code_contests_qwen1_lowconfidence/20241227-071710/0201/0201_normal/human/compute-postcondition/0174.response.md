Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `4 * n - 2`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p, p, ...]` with each element following the pattern until no further valid `p` can be found, `abort` is `True`, `index` is the last valid value of `index` before the loop breaks or all elements in `new_nodes` are exhausted, `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`, and `c` is greater than or equal to 0**
