The code assigns the value of `nodes[p]` to `index`. Given that `p = index * 2`, this means `index` is being reassigned to itself, since `p` is already calculated as `index * 2`. Therefore, `index` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is \(4 \times n - 2\); `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p, p]`; `abort` remains unchanged (either `True` or `False`); `index` is `nodes[p]`; `flag` is the value at index `p + 1` in the `nodes` list; `p` is `index * 2`.**
