Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0; `i` is \(4 \times n - 2\); `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p, p]`; `abort` remains unchanged (either `True` or `False`); if `index` is less than or equal to 0, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, `index` and `flag` retain their original states as `nodes[p]` and the value at index `p + 1` in the `nodes` list, respectively; `p` is `index * 2`.***
