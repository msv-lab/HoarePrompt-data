The code assigns the value of `index` to `nodes[v * 2]`. According to the initial state, `nodes[v * 2]` was previously `index`. The code does not affect the values of `v`, `storage[t + 1]`, or `storage[t]`. Therefore, the value of `v` remains the same, and the updated value of `nodes[v * 2]` is `index`.

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `v` is the new value at `storage[t + 1]`, `t` is now `storage[t]`**
