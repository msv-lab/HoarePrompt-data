The code `t = storage[t]` updates the value of `t` to be the value at the index `t` in the `storage` list. Initially, `v` is the value at index `t + 1` in the `storage` list, so updating `t` with the value at the index `t` means that `v` will now hold the same value it previously held because `v` was defined as `storage[t + 1]`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `nodes[v * 2]` remains `u + 4 * n - 2` (since `v` is unchanged).
- `v` is now the value at index `t + 1` in the `storage` list, which is the same as its original value before the code execution.

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `u + 4 * n - 2`, `v` is the value at index `t + 1` in the `storage` list**
