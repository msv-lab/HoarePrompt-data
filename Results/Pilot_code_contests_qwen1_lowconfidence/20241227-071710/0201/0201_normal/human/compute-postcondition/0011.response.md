Initially, we have:
- `storage[storage_index]` is equal to `lookup[v]` (which is now `storage_index`).
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` is equal to `u`.
- `lookup[u]` is equal to `storage_index - 2`.
- `storage_index` is equal to `storage_index + 2`.

After executing `storage_index += 2`:
- The value of `storage_index` is incremented by 2.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`storage[storage_index]` is equal to `lookup[v]` (which is now `storage_index`); `storage[storage_index + 1]` is equal to `u`; `lookup[u]` is equal to `storage_index - 2`; `storage_index` is equal to `storage_index + 2 + 2`.**

Simplifying the final state:
- `storage[storage_index]` is equal to `lookup[v]` (which is now `storage_index`).
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` is equal to `u`.
- `lookup[u]` is equal to `storage_index - 2`.
- `storage_index` is equal to `storage_index + 4`.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is equal to `lookup[v]` (which is now `storage_index`); `storage[storage_index + 1]` is equal to `u`; `lookup[u]` is equal to `storage_index - 2`; `storage_index` is equal to `storage_index + 4`.**
