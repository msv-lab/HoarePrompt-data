`nodes[p + 1]` is assigned the value `-1`. Initially, `p` is 0, so `p + 1` is 1. The value of `new_nodes` is unchanged, and `abort` remains `True`. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_nodes` must contain at least one element, `p` is 0, `abort` is `True`, and `nodes[1]` is `-1`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one element, `p` is 0, `abort` is `True`, and `nodes[1]` is `-1`**
