The code `p = i * 2` assigns the value of `i * 2` to the variable `p`. Given the initial state where `i` is `n-1`, the value of `p` will be `(n-1) * 2`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is (n-1) * 2, `c` is unknown, `abort` is unknown, `nodes` is unchanged, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`.**
