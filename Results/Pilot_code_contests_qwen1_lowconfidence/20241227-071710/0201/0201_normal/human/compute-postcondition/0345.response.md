Let's analyze the given information and determine the necessary adjustments step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `new_nodes` is a list of values.
   - `p` is the final value.
   - `abort` is `True`.
   - `c` is `-len(new_nodes)`, which means `c` is negative because `len(new_nodes)` is greater than 0.
   - `nodes` is unchanged except `nodes[-1] = -1` and `nodes[new_nodes[len(new_nodes) - 1] + 1] = -1`.
   - `count` is 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks.
   - `c` is less than 0.
   - `j` is `len(new_nodes) - 1`.
   - `len(new_nodes)` must be greater than 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs for `j` in `xrange(-c)`. Since `c` is negative, `-c` is positive. Therefore, the loop will run from `j = -c` to `j = 0`.

3. **Loop Iteration Analysis:**
   - Initially, `j` is set to `len(new_nodes) - 1`.
   - As the loop iterates, `j` decreases by 1 each time until it reaches 0.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - Let's assume the loop just finished its previous iteration. This means `j` was decremented to 0, and now `j` should be initialized to `-c` for the next iteration.
   - Since `c` is `-len(new_nodes)`, `-c` would be `len(new_nodes)`.
   - Thus, `j` will start from `len(new_nodes) - 1` (the initial value before the loop started) and will be set to `len(new_nodes)` for the next iteration.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `new_nodes` remains unchanged.
   - `p` remains unchanged.
   - `abort` remains `True`.
   - `c` remains `-len(new_nodes)`, which is still less than 0.
   - `nodes` remains unchanged.
   - `count` remains 0.
   - `i` remains `n-1`.
   - `index` remains the same as before the loop broke.
   - `j` will start from `len(new_nodes)` for the next iteration.

6. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - `len(new_nodes)` must still be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**

State: **`new_nodes` is a list of values, `p` is the final value, `abort` is `True`, `c` is `-len(new_nodes)`, `nodes` is unchanged except `nodes[-1] = -1` and `nodes[new_nodes[len(new_nodes) - 1] + 1] = -1`, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks, `c` is less than 0, `j` is `len(new_nodes)`, `len(new_nodes)` must be greater than 0**
