`nodes[p + 1]` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `new_nodes` is unchanged, `abort` remains `False`, and `p` remains the next element in `new_nodes`. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_nodes` contains at least one element, `abort` is `False`, `p` is the next element in `new_nodes`, and `nodes[p + 1]` is `1`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` contains at least one element, `abort` is `False`, `p` is the next element in `new_nodes`, and `nodes[p + 1]` is `1`**
