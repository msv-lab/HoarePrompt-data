The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, representing the number of districts.
- `k`: an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, representing the number of contestants to be removed.
- `edges`: a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `a` and `b` representing the districts connected by a path.

Based on the given output cases, the function does not explicitly return a value but seems to perform some operation related to removing `k` contestants from the districts and possibly analyzing the connectivity of the remaining districts. However, since the exact return value is not specified, we will focus on the parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `edges`, where `n` is the number of districts, `k` is the number of contestants to be removed, and `edges` is a list of tuples representing connections between districts.**
