The code `nodes[p + 1] = 1` assigns the value 1 to `nodes[p + 1]`. Given the initial state where `nodes[p + 1]` is 1, this assignment does not change its value since it is already set to 1. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one element, `nodes[p + 1]` is 1**
