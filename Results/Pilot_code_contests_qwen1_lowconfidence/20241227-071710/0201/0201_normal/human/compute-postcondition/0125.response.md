The variable `abort` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `new_nodes`, `p`, and `flag`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 4 * `n` - 2, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is (4 * `n` - 2) * 2, `abort` is True, `flag` is nodes[(4 * `n` - 2) * 2 + 1], and the current value of `flag` is -1.
