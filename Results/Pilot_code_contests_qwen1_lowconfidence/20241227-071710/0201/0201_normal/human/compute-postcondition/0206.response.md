The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `4 * n - 3`; `new_nodes` is an empty list; `abort` is `False`; `index` is an integer; `c` is an integer; `p` is `(4 * n - 3) * 2`; `flag` is 1**
