Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is `(n-1) * 2`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on the value of `flag`. Specifically, if `flag == -1`, then `abort` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `flag == 1`, then `abort` is set to `False` and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. In all other cases, `abort` remains `False` and no changes occur to other variables. `c` is unknown, `nodes` is unchanged, `count` is 0, and `i` is `n-1`.***
