`storage_index` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `storage_index` was `storage_index`. After the increment, `storage_index` is now `storage_index + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is equal to `lookup[u]`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is equal to `v`, `lookup[u]` is equal to `storage_index`, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 2`**
