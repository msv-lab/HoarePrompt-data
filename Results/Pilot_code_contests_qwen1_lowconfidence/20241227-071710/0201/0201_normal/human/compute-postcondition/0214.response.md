The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `4 * n - 3`
- `new_nodes` is a list containing one element `(4 * n - 3) * 2`
- `abort` remains `True` if `flag` equals `-1`; otherwise, `abort` remains `False`
- `index` is less than or equal to 0
- `c` is an integer
- `p` is `(4 * n - 3) * 2`
- `flag` is `-1` if `flag` equals `-1`; otherwise, `flag` is `1`

The code snippet updates `p` as follows:
```python
p = index * 2
```

Given that `index` is less than or equal to 0, let's consider the possible values for `index`. Since no specific value is given for `index`, the only specific value we know is that it is less than or equal to 0. Let's assume the most straightforward case where `index` is 0 (since it's a common default value when no specific value is given).

If `index` is 0:
- `p` will be `0 * 2 = 0`.

Other variables remain unchanged based on their initial conditions.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `4 * n - 3`
- `new_nodes` is a list containing one element `(4 * n - 3) * 2`
- `abort` remains `True` if `flag` equals `-1`; otherwise, `abort` remains `False`
- `index` is less than or equal to 0
- `c` is an integer
- `p` is `0`
- `flag` is `-1` if `flag` equals `-1`; otherwise, `flag` is `1`

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `4 * n - 3`; `new_nodes` is a list containing one element `(4 * n - 3) * 2`; `abort` remains `True` if `flag` equals `-1`; otherwise, `abort` remains `False`; `index` is less than or equal to 0; `c` is an integer; `p` is `0`; `flag` is `-1` if `flag` equals `-1`; otherwise, `flag` is `1**
