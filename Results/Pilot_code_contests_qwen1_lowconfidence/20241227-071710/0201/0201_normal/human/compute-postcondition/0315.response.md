The code snippet sets `p` to `index * 2`. Given the initial state, the value of `p` is updated, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `p` is `index * 2`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[n-1] * 2, index * 2, index * 2`, `p` is `index * 2`, `c` is unknown, `nodes` is unchanged, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `index` is `nodes[index * 2]`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 2]`, and `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on the value of `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`.**
