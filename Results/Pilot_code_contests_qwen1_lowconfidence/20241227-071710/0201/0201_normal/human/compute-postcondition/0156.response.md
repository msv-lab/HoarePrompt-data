Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0; `i` is \(4 \times n - 2\); `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p]`; `abort` remains unchanged (either `True` or `False`); `index` is `nodes[p]`; `flag` is the value at index `p + 1` in the `nodes` list; `p` is `index * 2`. If `flag` is `-1` or `1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
