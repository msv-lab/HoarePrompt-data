The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables, but it indicates that the loop will continue its next iteration without executing the remaining part of the current iteration's body.

Given the initial state:
- `nodes[p + 1]` is -1
- `nodes[p_next + 1]` is uninitialized or -1
- `index` is the last valid value of `index` before the loop breaks or all elements in `new_nodes` are exhausted
- `abort` is `True`
- `i` is `4 * n - 2`
- `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p, p, ...]` with each element following the pattern until no further valid `p` can be found

Since the `continue` statement does not modify any variables, the values of the variables remain the same as they were before the statement was executed.

Output State: **`nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `nodes[p_next + 1]` is uninitialized or -1, `index` is the last valid value of `index` before the loop breaks or all elements in `new_nodes` are exhausted, `abort` is `True`, `i` is `4 * n - 2`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p, p, ...]` with each element following the pattern until no further valid `p` can be found.**
