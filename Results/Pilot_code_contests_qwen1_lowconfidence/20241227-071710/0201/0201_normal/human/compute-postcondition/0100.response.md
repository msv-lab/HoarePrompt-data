`stack_append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the stack. The initial state specifies that the value of `nodes[v * 2]` is now `u + 4 * n - 2`. This code does not affect any other variables or the value of `nodes[v * 2]`. Therefore, the only change is the appending of `v` to the stack.

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `u + 4 * n - 2`, v is appended to the stack**
