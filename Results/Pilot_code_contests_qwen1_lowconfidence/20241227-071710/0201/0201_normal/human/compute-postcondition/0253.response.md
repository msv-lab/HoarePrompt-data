The code updates `nodes[p + 1]` to 1. Given the initial state:

- `new_nodes` must have at least one element
- `p` is the last index of `new_nodes` or -1 if `new_nodes` is empty
- `abort` and `nodes` will be updated within the loop
- `c` is greater than or equal to 0

After the code runs, the following changes occur:
- `p + 1` is used as an index to update `nodes`. Since `p` is the last index of `new_nodes` (or -1 if `new_nodes` is empty), `p + 1` would be the next index in the list, which means this index is being set to 1.

Therefore, the value of `nodes` at the index `p + 1` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` must have at least one element, `p` is the last index of `new_nodes` or -1 if `new_nodes` is empty, `abort` and `nodes` will be updated within the loop, `c` is greater than or equal to 0; `nodes[p + 1]` is 1**
