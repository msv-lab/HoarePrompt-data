Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `new_nodes` must have at least two elements.
   - `p` is the second-to-last index of `new_nodes` or -1 if `new_nodes` has only one element.
   - `abort` and `nodes` will be updated within the loop.
   - `c` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `nodes[p + 1]` is 1.

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `new_nodes`.
   - For the first iteration, `p` would be the second-to-last index of `new_nodes`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `p` is set to the second-to-last index of `new_nodes` in the first iteration, for the next iteration, `p` should be decremented by 1 (or -1 if `new_nodes` has only one element).
   - If `new_nodes` has only one element, `p` remains -1, and the loop stops.

4. **Ensuring Loop Continues:**
   - To ensure the loop continues, `new_nodes` must have at least two elements.
   - If `new_nodes` has exactly two elements, `p` will be 0, and the loop will continue to the last element.

5. **Updating Other Variables:**
   - `abort` and `nodes` will be updated within the loop.
   - `c` must remain greater than or equal to 0.
   - `nodes[p + 1]` should still be 1 for the next iteration.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `new_nodes` must have at least two elements.
- `p` should be the second-to-last index of `new_nodes` (or -1 if `new_nodes` has only one element).
- `abort` and `nodes` will be updated within the loop.
- `c` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `nodes[p + 1]` should still be 1.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: `new_nodes` must have at least two elements, `p` is the second-to-last index of `new_nodes` (or -1 if `new_nodes` has only one element), `abort` and `nodes` will be updated within the loop, `c` is greater than or equal to 0, `nodes[p + 1]` is 1**.
