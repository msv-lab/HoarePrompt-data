The `continue` statement in the provided code snippet does not change any variable values or affect the current loop iteration. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not alter the state of the variables outside of a loop context.

Given the initial state, the `continue` statement does not change any of the values of the variables mentioned. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[u * 2]` set to `n` and `nodes[(u + 4 * n - 2) * 2]` set to `n`, `nodes[v * 2]` for `v` from `u + 1` to `u + 4 * n - 3` set to `n`, `stack` now contains `u` to `u + 4 * n - 3`, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is `u + 4 * n - 2`, `parent_index` is `n`, `v` is `storage[t + 1]` (where `t` is `lookup[u + 4 * n - 2]` and is non-negative), `nodes[u * 2]` is `n`, `t` is `lookup[u + 4 * n - 2]` (non-negative), `t` is assigned the value `storage[t]`, and `v` is equal to `parent_index`.**
