`parent_index` is assigned the value of `nodes[index * 2]`. Given the initial state, `index` is `n`, so `parent_index` becomes `nodes[n * 2]`. The value of `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with all elements set to 0, so `nodes[n * 2]` is `0`. Therefore, `parent_index` is `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is `4 * n - 4`, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with all elements set to 0, `stack` is an empty list, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is `n`, `parent_index` is `0`**
