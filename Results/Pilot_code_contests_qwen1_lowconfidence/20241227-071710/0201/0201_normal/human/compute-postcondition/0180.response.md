`nodes[p + 1]` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `p` is the next element in `new_nodes`, so `nodes[p + 1]` is updated to `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one element, `abort` is `False`, `p` is the next element in `new_nodes`; `nodes[p + 1]` is `1`**
