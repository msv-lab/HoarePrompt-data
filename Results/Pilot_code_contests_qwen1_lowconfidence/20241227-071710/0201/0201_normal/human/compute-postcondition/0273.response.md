The code `new_nodes = []` initializes an empty list for `new_nodes`. This means that `new_nodes` is now an empty list. All other variables (`p`, `c`, `abort`, `nodes`, `count`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is -1, `c` is unknown, `abort` is unknown, `nodes` is unchanged, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`.**
