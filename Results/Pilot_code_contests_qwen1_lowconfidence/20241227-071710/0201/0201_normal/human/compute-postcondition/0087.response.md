The code `stack_append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the `stack`. Given that `v` is equal to `u` from the initial state, the `stack` will append `u`.

Let's list the updated values of the variables:
- `storage[storage_index]` remains `4 * n - 2`.
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` remains `u`.
- `lookup[u]` remains `4 * n - 2`.
- `lookup[v]` remains undefined since no value was assigned to it in this code snippet.
- `storage_index` remains `8 * n - 4`.
- `nodes` remains a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[u * 2]` set to `n` and `nodes[v * 2]` set to `n`.
- `stack` now contains `u` and `u + 1` plus the newly appended `u`.
- `stack_pop` and `stack_append` remain unchanged as they are methods.
- `index` remains `n`.
- `parent_index` remains `n`.
- `v` remains `u`.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[u * 2]` set to `n` and `nodes[v * 2]` set to `n`, `stack` now contains `u`, `u + 1`, and `u`, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is `n`, `parent_index` is `n`, `v` is `u`**.
