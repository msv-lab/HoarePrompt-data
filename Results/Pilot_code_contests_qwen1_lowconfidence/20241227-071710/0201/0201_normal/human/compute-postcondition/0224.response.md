The `break` statement does not change any variable values but indicates that the program will exit the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block to exit here, the only change is that the program will exit wherever this statement is located.

Output State: **`flag` is equal to `nodes[p + 1]`, `new_nodes` contains the original elements plus `p`, `index` is `nodes[p]`, and either `flag` equals -1 in which case `abort` is `True`, or no changes are made to the variables, and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.**
