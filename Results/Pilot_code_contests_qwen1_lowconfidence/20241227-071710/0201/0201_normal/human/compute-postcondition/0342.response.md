The code `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` updates the value of the element in the `nodes` list at the index `new_nodes[j] + 1` to `-1`. 

Let's break down the values:
- `new_nodes[j]` is a value from the `new_nodes` list, and since `j` is defined as `-c`, and `c` is `-len(new_nodes)`, we have `j = -(-len(new_nodes)) = len(new_nodes)`.
- Thus, `new_nodes[j]` is `new_nodes[len(new_nodes)]`, which is out of bounds for the list `new_nodes` because list indices are zero-based and cannot be equal to the length of the list.

Since accessing an out-of-bounds index in a list would typically raise an error in Python, this line of code would raise an `IndexError`. However, following the instructions, we will assume the code execution proceeds with updating the value at the calculated index, even though this is not typical behavior.

Given the above, let's proceed with the calculation:

- The value of `new_nodes[j]` (which is `new_nodes[len(new_nodes)]`) is not directly accessible, but we know the operation is trying to access an index that is out of bounds.
- Assuming the code attempts to update the value, the effective value being updated is `nodes[-1]` because `new_nodes[j] + 1` would be `new_nodes[len(new_nodes)] + 1`, and since `len(new_nodes)` is a non-negative integer, `new_nodes[len(new_nodes)]` is out of bounds, making the actual index accessed `nodes[-1]`.

Therefore, the value of `nodes[-1]` is updated to `-1`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is a list of values, `p` is the final value, `abort` is `True`, `c` is `-len(new_nodes)`, `nodes` is unchanged except `nodes[-1] = -1`, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks, `c` is less than 0, `j` is `-c`, `len(new_nodes)` must be greater than 0**
