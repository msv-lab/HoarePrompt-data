The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only causes the exit from the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the given code snippet, we assume that the `break` statement is part of a loop or condition outside this snippet. Given that the code snippet itself does not alter any variables, the values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is \(4 \times n - 2\); `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p, p]`; `abort` remains unchanged (either `True` or `False`); `index` is `nodes[p]`; `flag` is the value at index `p + 1` in the `nodes` list; `p` is `index * 2`.**
