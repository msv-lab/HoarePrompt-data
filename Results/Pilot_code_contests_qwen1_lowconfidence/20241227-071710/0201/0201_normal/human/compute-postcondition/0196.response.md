The code initializes `new_nodes` as an empty list, which overwrites the previous value of `new_nodes`. The values of `n`, `i`, `abort`, `index`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of `new_nodes` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `4 * n - 3`, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `abort` is a boolean, `index` is an integer, and `c` is an integer.**
