The code `nodes[p + 1] = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the element in the list `nodes` at index `p + 1`. Since the initial state does not provide any specific value for `p` or `nodes`, we can only state that the element at index `p + 1` in the list `nodes` is now `-1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **nodes[p + 1] is -1**
