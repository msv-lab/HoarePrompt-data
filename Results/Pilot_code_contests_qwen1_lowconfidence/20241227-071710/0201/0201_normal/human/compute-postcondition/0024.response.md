The code updates the value of `lookup[u]` to be `storage_index`. From the initial state, we know that `lookup[u]` was `storage_index + 6`, and `storage_index` is being updated to `storage_index + 10`.

Therefore, after executing the line `lookup[u] = storage_index`, the value of `lookup[u]` will be updated to `storage_index + 10`.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index + 6`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `v`, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index + 10`, `lookup[v]` is `storage_index + 8`, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 10**
