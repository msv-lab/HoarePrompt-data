The code appends the value of `p` to `new_nodes`. The value of `p` is `nodes[p] * 2`. The other variables (`flag`, `nodes`, `index`, and `p`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `flag` is equal to `nodes[p + 1]`
- `new_nodes` contains the original elements plus `p` and now includes `p` (which is `nodes[p] * 2`)
- `index` is `nodes[p]`
- `p` is `nodes[p] * 2`

Output State: **`flag` is equal to `nodes[p + 1]`, `new_nodes` contains the original elements plus `p` and includes `nodes[p] * 2`, `index` is `nodes[p]`, and `p` is `nodes[p] * 2`**
