The code assigns `i * 2` to the variable `p`. Given the initial state where `i` is `4 * n - 2`, the value of `p` is calculated as `(4 * n - 2) * 2`. The values of `n` and `new_nodes` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 4 * n - 2, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is (4 * n - 2) * 2**
