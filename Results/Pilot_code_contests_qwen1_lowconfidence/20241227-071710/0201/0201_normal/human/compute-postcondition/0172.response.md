Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `4 * n - 2`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p, p, ...]` with each element following the pattern until no further valid `p` can be found, `abort` is `True`, `index` is the last valid value of `index` before the loop breaks or all elements in `new_nodes` are exhausted. If `abort` is `True`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1` and `nodes[p_next + 1]` is uninitialized or `-1`. Otherwise, there is no change in these variables.***
