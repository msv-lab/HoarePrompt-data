`i` is updated to `i * 2`, which means `p` is assigned the value of `i * 2`. The initial value of `i` is `4 * n - 3`, so `p` will be `(4 * n - 3) * 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `4 * n - 3`; `new_nodes` is an empty list; `abort` is a boolean; `index` is an integer; `c` is an integer; `p` is `(4 * n - 3) * 2`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `4 * n - 3`; `new_nodes` is an empty list; `abort` is a boolean; `index` is an integer; `c` is an integer; `p` is `(4 * n - 3) * 2`**
