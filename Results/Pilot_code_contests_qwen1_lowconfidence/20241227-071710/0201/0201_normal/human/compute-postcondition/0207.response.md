Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `4 * n - 3`; `new_nodes` is an empty list; `abort` is `False`; `index` is an integer; `c` is an integer; `p` is `(4 * n - 3) * 2`; `flag` is 1. Since the else part is not provided and there is no modification to the variables outside the if condition, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition within the if condition.***
