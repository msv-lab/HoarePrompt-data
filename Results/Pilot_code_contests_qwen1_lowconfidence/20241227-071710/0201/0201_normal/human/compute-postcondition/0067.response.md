The code `v = storage[t + 1]` assigns the value of `storage[t + 1]` to `v`. Since `t` is defined as `lookup[n]` and `lookup[n]` is `4 * n - 2`, we substitute `t` with `4 * n - 2`. Therefore, `v` is assigned the value of `storage[(4 * n - 2) + 1]`, which simplifies to `storage[4 * n - 1]`. The value of `storage[4 * n - 1]` is equal to `u` from the initial state. Thus, `v` is now `u`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[u * 2]` set to `n` and all other elements set to 0, `stack` now contains one less occurrence of `u`, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is the new value of the last element in the stack (which was `n`), `parent_index` is `n`, `v` is `u`, and `nodes[u * 2]` is `n`.**
