Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `new_nodes` is a list containing all the elements appended during the loop.
   - `p` is the last index of `new_nodes` (or -1 if `new_nodes` is empty).
   - If `c >= 0`, then `abort` is `False`, `nodes[p + 1]` for each `p` in `new_nodes` is `1`, `c` is `0`, and `count` is `0`.
   - Otherwise, all `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` for `j` in the range `[-len(new_nodes), -1]` are `-1`, and `j` is `-len(new_nodes) - 1`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i` in `range(n, 0, -1)`. This means the loop starts from `n` and decrements `i` until `i` reaches `0`.

3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, we need to determine the new values of `i` and the conditions that must hold true.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - The value of `i` decreases by 1 in each iteration, starting from `n` and ending at `1` (inclusive).
   - Since the loop is decrementing, the next value of `i` will be `i - 1` from the current value.
   - The other variables (`new_nodes`, `p`, `abort`, `nodes`, etc.) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no specific loop body is provided, we assume they retain their current values.

5. **Final Adjusted State**: Given the loop runs in reverse order, the only change required is the value of `i`:
   - If `i` was previously `n`, it will now be `n-1`.
   - If `i` was any other value, it will decrease by 1.

Since the loop is decrementing `i` from `n` down to `1`, the next value of `i` will be `n-1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`new_nodes` is a list containing all the elements appended during the loop, `p` is the last index of `new_nodes` (or -1 if `new_nodes` is empty). If `c >= 0`, then `abort` is `False`, `nodes[p + 1]` for each `p` in `new_nodes` is `1`, `c` is `0`, and `count` is `0`. Otherwise, all `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` for `j` in the range `[-len(new_nodes), -1]` are `-1`, and `j` is `-len(new_nodes) - 1`. And `i` is `n-1`.**
