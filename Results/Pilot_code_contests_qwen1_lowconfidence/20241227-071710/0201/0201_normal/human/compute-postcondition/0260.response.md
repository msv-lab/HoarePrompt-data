Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is a list containing all the elements appended during the loop, `p` is the last index of `new_nodes` (or -1 if `new_nodes` is empty), `abort` is `False` if no `flag` at `p + 1` was `-1` when the loop stopped, otherwise `abort` is `True`, and `nodes` is updated such that for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `1`; `c` is equal to `0`; `count` is equal to `0`.***
