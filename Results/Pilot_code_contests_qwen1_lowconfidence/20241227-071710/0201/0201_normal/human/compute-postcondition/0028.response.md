`lookup[v]` is updated to `storage_index`. Given the initial state, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 12`, and `lookup[v]` was previously `storage_index + 8`. After the assignment, `lookup[v]` becomes `storage_index + 12`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index + 10`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index + 10`, `lookup[v]` is `storage_index + 12`, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 12**
