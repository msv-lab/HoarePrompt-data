The function `func_1(n, k, edges)` is called with the given parameters. However, the function itself is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we cannot determine the exact changes it will make to the variables. The only thing we can infer is that the function may modify the values of `n`, `k`, or `edges`, but without knowing the implementation of `func_1`, we cannot specify those changes.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are specific integers such that \(1 \leq k < n \leq 10^6\)
- `edges` is a list of \(n - 1\) tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the districts connected by a path

Since the function's behavior is unknown, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are specific integers such that \(1 \leq k < n \leq 10^6\), `edges` is a list of \(n - 1\) tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the districts connected by a path**
