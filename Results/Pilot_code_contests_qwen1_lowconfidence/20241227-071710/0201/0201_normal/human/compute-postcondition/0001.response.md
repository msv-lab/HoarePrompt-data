The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from standard input and splits them using `map(int, ...)` and then assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means that the values of `n` and `k` are now specific integers as per the input, and the list `edges` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are specific integers such that 1 â‰¤ `k` < `n` â‰¤ 10^6, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the districts connected by a path.**
