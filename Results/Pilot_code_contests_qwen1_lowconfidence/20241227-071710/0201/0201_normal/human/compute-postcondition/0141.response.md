The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged after executing the `break` statement. Therefore, the output state includes the original values of all variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is \(4 \times n - 2\), `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4]`, `abort` is `True`, `index` is `[16n - 8]`, `flag` is the value at index \(8n - 3\) of the `nodes` list.**
