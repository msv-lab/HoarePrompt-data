The code `index = nodes[p]` assigns the value of `nodes[p]` to the variable `index`. However, the value of `nodes` is unchanged from its initial state. The values of `new_nodes`, `p`, `abort`, `c`, `count`, and `i` are also unchanged from their initial states.

Given the initial state:
- `new_nodes` is `[n-1] * 2`
- `p` is `(n-1) * 2`
- `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on the value of `flag`
- `c` is unknown
- `nodes` is unchanged
- `count` is 0
- `i` is `n-1`

After executing the line of code, the value of `index` is set to `nodes[p]`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[n-1] * 2`, `p` is `(n-1) * 2`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on the value of `flag`, `c` is unknown, `nodes` is unchanged, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `index` is `nodes[p]`.**
