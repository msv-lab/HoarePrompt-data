The code snippet sets `nodes[p + 1]` to `-1` during each iteration, where `p` takes on the value of each element in `new_nodes`. Since `new_nodes` must have at least one element, `p` will take on the value of the first element in `new_nodes` and the corresponding `nodes[p + 1]` will be set to `-1`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` must have at least 1 element, `nodes[nodes[new_nodes[0]] + 1]` is `-1`**
