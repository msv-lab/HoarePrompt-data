Postcondition: **`storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[u * 2]` set to `n` and `nodes[(u + 4 * n - 2) * 2]` set to `n`, `nodes[v * 2]` for `v` from `u + 1` to `u + 4 * n - 3` set to `n`, `stack` now contains `u` to `u + 4 * n - 3`, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is `u + 4 * n - 2`, `parent_index` is `n`, `v` is `storage[t + 1]` (where `t` is `lookup[u + 4 * n - 2]` and is non-negative), `nodes[u * 2]` is `n`, `t` is `lookup[u + 4 * n - 2]` (non-negative), `t` is assigned the value `storage[t]`, and `v` is equal to `parent_index`.**
