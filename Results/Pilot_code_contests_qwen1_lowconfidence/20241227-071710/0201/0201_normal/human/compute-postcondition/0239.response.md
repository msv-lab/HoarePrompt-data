Let's analyze the given loop and determine its final state after all iterations have executed.

### Initial State:
- \( n \) is greater than 0.
- \( i \) is \( 4 \times n - 3 \).
- \( new\_nodes \) is an empty list.
- \( abort \) is `False`.
- \( index \) is an integer.
- \( c \) is an integer.
- \( p \) is \( (4 \times n - 3) \times 2 \).

### Loop Code:
```python
while True:
    flag = nodes[p + 1]
    if flag == -1:
        abort = True
        break
    elif flag == 1:
        break
    new_nodes.append(p)
    index = nodes[p]
    if index <= 0:
        break
    p = index * 2
```

### Observations from the Given Output States:

1. **After 1 iteration:**
   - `new_nodes` contains one element, which is \( (4 \times n - 3) \times 2 \).
   - If `flag` at position \( p + 1 \) is `-1`, then `abort` becomes `True`.
   - Otherwise, `abort` remains `False`.
   - `index` is less than or equal to 0, so the loop breaks here.
   - `p` becomes `0`.

2. **After 2 iterations:**
   - `new_nodes` contains the original element plus \( p \).
   - `index` is `nodes[p]`.
   - `p` is now `nodes[p] * 2`.

3. **After 3 iterations:**
   - `new_nodes` contains the original elements plus `p` and includes `nodes[p] * 2`.
   - `index` is `nodes[p] * 2`.
   - `p` is `nodes[p] * 4`.

### General Pattern:
- The loop continues appending values to `new_nodes` until either `flag` at position `p + 1` is `-1` or `index` is less than or equal to 0.
- `abort` becomes `True` if `flag` at `p + 1` is `-1`.
- The loop stops when `index` is non-positive.

### Final State Analysis:
- Since the loop is `while True`, it will continue executing until the condition inside the loop fails (either `flag` at `p + 1` is `-1` or `index` is non-positive).
- The loop will stop when `index` is non-positive, meaning the loop will eventually terminate with `index <= 0`.
- Therefore, the final value of `p` will be `0` because the loop will stop appending new values once `index` becomes non-positive.
- `new_nodes` will contain all the values appended during the iterations.
- `abort` will be `True` if `flag` at `p + 1` was `-1` at the point where the loop stopped.

### Output State:
Output State: **`new_nodes` contains all the elements appended during the loop, `p` is 0, `abort` is `True` if `flag` at `p + 1` was `-1` when the loop stopped, otherwise `abort` is `False`, and `index` is non-positive.**
