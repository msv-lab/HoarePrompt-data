Postcondition: ***`flag` is equal to `nodes[p + 1]`, `new_nodes` contains the original elements plus `p`, and `index` is `nodes[p]`. If `index <= 0`, `abort` is set to `True` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement. Otherwise, the variables remain unchanged, maintaining the precondition state.***
