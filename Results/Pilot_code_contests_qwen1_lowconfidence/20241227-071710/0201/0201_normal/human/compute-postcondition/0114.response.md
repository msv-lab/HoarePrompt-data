The code `stack_append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the stack. Based on the initial state, `v` is the new value at `storage[t + 1]`, and `nodes[v * 2]` is `index`. After executing the code, `v` is appended to the stack, but its value in `storage[t + 1]` does not change. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `v` is the new value at `storage[t + 1]` and is appended to the stack, `t` is now `storage[t]`**
