The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables; it simply continues the loop. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `v` is the new value at `storage[t + 1]`, `t` is now `storage[t]`**
