The code snippet `continue` does not change any variable values but instead moves to the next iteration of the enclosing loop. Since the initial values of the variables are not altered by this statement, we only note that we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[u * 2]` set to `n` and `nodes[v * 2]` set to `n`, `stack` now contains `u` and `u + 1`, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is `n`, `parent_index` is `n`, `v` is `u`, `t` is `4 * n - 2` or `u` depending on its initial value, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
