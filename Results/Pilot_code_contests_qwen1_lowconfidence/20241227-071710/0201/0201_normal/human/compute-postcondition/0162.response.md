Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 4 * `n` - 2, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p, p, ...]` with each element following the pattern until no further valid `p` can be found, `abort` remains `True` if `flag` at any point was `-1`, otherwise `abort` remains `False`, `index` is the last valid value of `index` before the loop breaks or all elements in `new_nodes` are exhausted.**
