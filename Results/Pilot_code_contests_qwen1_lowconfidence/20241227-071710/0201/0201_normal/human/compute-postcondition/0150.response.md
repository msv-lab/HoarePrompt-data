Let's break down the given state and the `while True` loop to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given States:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is \(4 \times n - 2\)
- `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p]`
- `abort` remains `True` if `flag` equals \(-(8n - 4) - 1\), `abort` remains `False` if `flag` does not equal \(-(8n - 4) - 1\) and does not equal \(8n - 3\)
- `index` is `nodes[p]`
- `flag` is assigned the value at index \(8n - 3\) of the `nodes` list
- `p` is `index * 2`

### Analysis of the Loop:
The `while True` loop means the loop will continue indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Therefore, we need to check if any conditions can prevent the loop from executing one more time.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
The loop continues as long as there are no explicit exit conditions provided in the loop body. However, based on the current states, we need to ensure that all conditions necessary for the loop to continue are met.

### Steps to Determine Adjustments:
1. **Check `n`**: Since `n` is already greater than 0, this condition is always satisfied.
2. **Check `i`**: The value of `i` is \(4 \times n - 2\). This is already calculated and does not affect the loop continuation directly.
3. **Check `new_nodes`**: The list `new_nodes` contains `[8n - 4, p]`. This is a computed value based on `n` and does not affect the loop directly.
4. **Check `abort`**: 
   - `abort` remains `True` if `flag` equals \(-(8n - 4) - 1\).
   - `abort` remains `False` if `flag` does not equal \(-(8n - 4) - 1\) and does not equal \(8n - 3\).

For the loop to continue, `abort` must be `False`. The only way `abort` could be `True` is if `flag` equals \(-(8n - 4) - 1\). Therefore, we need to ensure that `flag` does not equal \(-(8n - 4) - 1\).

5. **Check `index` and `flag`**:
   - `index` is `nodes[p]`.
   - `flag` is assigned the value at index \(8n - 3\) of the `nodes` list.
   - For the loop to continue, `flag` should not be \(-(8n - 4) - 1\).

6. **Check `p`**: 
   - `p` is `index * 2`.

Since `p` is derived from `index`, and `index` itself is derived from `nodes[p]`, `p` is correctly set based on the current values of `nodes` and `index`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop continues, we need to ensure that `flag` does not equal \(-(8n - 4) - 1\).

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is \(4 \times n - 2\), `new_nodes` is a list containing `[8n - 4, p]`, `abort` remains `False` (i.e., `flag` does not equal \(-(8n - 4) - 1\)), `index` is `nodes[p]`, `flag` is assigned the value at index \(8n - 3\) of the `nodes` list, `p` is `index * 2`**.
