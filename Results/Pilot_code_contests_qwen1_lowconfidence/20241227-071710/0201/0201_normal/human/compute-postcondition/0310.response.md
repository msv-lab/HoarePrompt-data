Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is `[n-1] * 2, index * 2`, `p` is `index * 2`, `c` is unknown, `nodes` is unchanged, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `index` is `nodes[index * 2]`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 2]`. If `flag == -1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `abort` is set to `True`. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is exited regardless of the condition, and `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on the value of `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`.***
