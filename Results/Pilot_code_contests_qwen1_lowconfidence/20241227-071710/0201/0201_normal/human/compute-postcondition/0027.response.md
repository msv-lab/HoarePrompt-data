Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index + 10`
   - `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `v`
   - `lookup[u]` is `storage_index + 10`
   - `lookup[v]` is `storage_index + 8`
   - `storage_index` is `storage_index + 12`

2. Code Execution:
   - The code sets `storage[storage_index + 1] = u`.

3. Impact on Variables:
   - `storage[storage_index + 1]` is now `u`.
   - `storage_index` remains unchanged because the assignment does not directly affect its value.

4. Updated Values:
   - `storage[storage_index]` is still `storage_index + 10`.
   - `storage[storage_index + 1]` is now `u`.
   - `lookup[u]` is still `storage_index + 10`.
   - `lookup[v]` is still `storage_index + 8`.
   - `storage_index` is still `storage_index + 12`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index + 10`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index + 10`, `lookup[v]` is `storage_index + 8`, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 12`**
