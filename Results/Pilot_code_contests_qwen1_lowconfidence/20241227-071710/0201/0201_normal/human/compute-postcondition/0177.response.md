According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p` and the list `new_nodes`. For the loop to execute again, `p` must be an element of `new_nodes` and `new_nodes` must contain at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `new_nodes` contains at least one element.
- `abort` is `False`.
- `nodes[p + 1]` is `1`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `p` must be an element of `new_nodes`.
- `new_nodes` must still contain at least one element (since the condition for the loop to continue is that `new_nodes` contains at least one element).

Given these conditions, let's assume `p` takes the next value from `new_nodes` (as it iterates through the elements). Therefore, `p` will be set to the next element in `new_nodes`, and `new_nodes` will still contain at least one element since we are iterating through its elements.

State: **`new_nodes` contains at least one element, `abort` is `False`, `nodes[p + 1]` is not specified as it changes with each iteration but `p` is now the next element in `new_nodes`**.

To be precise and ensure clarity, we can specify `p` as the next element in `new_nodes`:

State: **`new_nodes` contains at least one element, `abort` is `False`, `p` is the next element in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is not specified as it changes with each iteration but is valid for the current `p`**.
