The code assigns the value of `index` to `nodes[v * 2]`. From the initial state, we know that `v` is `storage[4 * n - 1]` and `index` is `n`. Therefore, `nodes[v * 2]` is updated to `n`.

Here is the step-by-step calculation:

1. `v` is `storage[4 * n - 1]`.
2. `index` is `n`.
3. The code updates `nodes[v * 2]` to `index`, which means `nodes[v * 2]` is now `n`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `u`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with all elements set to 0, `stack` is an empty list, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is `n`, `parent_index` is `0`, `t` is `u`, `v` is `storage[4 * n - 1]`, and `nodes[v * 2]` is `n`.**
