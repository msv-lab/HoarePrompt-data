Let's analyze the loop and its behavior step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `new_nodes` contains all the elements appended during the loop.
- `p` is the last index of `new_nodes` (or -1 if `new_nodes` is empty).
- `abort` is `True` if any `flag` at `p + 1` was `-1` when the loop stopped, otherwise `False`.
- `nodes` is updated such that for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`.
- `c` is greater than `len(new_nodes)`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(-c):
    nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1
```

### Understanding the Loop:
- The loop runs for `c` iterations, but since `range(-c)` generates a range starting from `-c` and ending at `-1`, the loop will run for `abs(c)` iterations.
- In each iteration, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is set to `-1`.

### Output State After Each Iteration:
- After 1 iteration (`j = -1`):
  - `nodes[new_nodes[-1] + 1]` is set to `-1`.
  - `j` is `-1`.
- After 2 iterations (`j = -2`):
  - `nodes[new_nodes[-2] + 1]` is set to `-1`.
  - `j` is `-2`.
- After 3 iterations (`j = -3`):
  - `nodes[new_nodes[-3] + 1]` is set to `-1`.
  - `j` is `-3`.

### Final Analysis:
- Since `c` is greater than `len(new_nodes)`, the loop will always run for `len(new_nodes)` iterations because `new_nodes` is the limiting factor.
- After all iterations, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` for all `j` in the range `[-len(new_nodes), -1]` will be set to `-1`.
- The value of `j` will be `-len(new_nodes) - 1` after the loop finishes.

### Final Output State:
- All `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` for `j` in the range `[-len(new_nodes), -1]` will be `-1`.
- `j` will be `-len(new_nodes) - 1`.

### Formatted Output State:
Output State: **all `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` for `j` in the range `[-len(new_nodes), -1]` are `-1`, `j` is `-len(new_nodes) - 1`.**
