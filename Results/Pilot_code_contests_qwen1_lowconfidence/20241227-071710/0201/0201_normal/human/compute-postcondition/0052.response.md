The code assigns the value of `index` to `nodes[v * 2]`. Given that `v` is equal to `u` and `index` is equal to `n`, the value of `nodes[u * 2]` changes to `n`. All other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `u`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with all elements set to 0, `stack` now contains `u`, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is `n`, `parent_index` is `0`, `t` is `u`, `v` is `u`, and `nodes[u * 2]` is `n`.
