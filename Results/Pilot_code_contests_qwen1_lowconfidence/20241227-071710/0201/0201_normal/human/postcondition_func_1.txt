The function reads the number of districts \( n \), the number of contestants to be removed \( k \), and a list of connections between districts from standard input. It then calls another function `func_1` with these parameters. After `func_1` completes its execution, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that the variable `edges` contains the list of connections between districts, and `n` and `k` hold the values read from the input. Potential edge cases include invalid input formats or values, which would result in undefined behavior as no error handling is explicitly mentioned in the provided code.
