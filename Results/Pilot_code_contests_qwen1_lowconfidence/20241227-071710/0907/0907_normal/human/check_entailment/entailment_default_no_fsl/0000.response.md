Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly count all possible opposite couples. Specifically, the code only considers the counts of opposite pairs within the range from -10 to 10 and does not handle the case where zero is involved properly. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5
-3 3 0 0 3
```

The correct output should be 3 because there are three opposite couples: (-3, 3), (-3, 3), and (0, 0). However, the provided code will only count the pairs involving non-zero values, thus it will only count 2 out of the 3 possible couples. Additionally, the calculation for zero is incorrect. The correct way to handle zero would be to use the combination formula \( \binom{a[0]}{2} \), which is \( \frac{a[0] * (a[0] - 1)}{2} \), but the current implementation does not correctly account for this.

To fix this, the code should include the following adjustments:

1. Properly handle the zero case using the combination formula.
2. Ensure that all opposite pairs are considered, including those involving zero.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    a = [0] * 21  # Array to count occurrences of each t value from -10 to 10
    n = int(input())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    for val in t:
        a[val + 10] += 1  # Adjust index to be from 0 to 20
    
    ans = 0
    for i in range(10):
        ans += a[i] * a[19 - i]  # Count pairs (i, -i)
    
    ans += a[10] * (a[10] - 1) // 2  # Handle zero case using combination formula
    
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that all possible opposite couples are counted correctly, including those involving zero.
