Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program expects the first line to contain an integer `n`, representing the number of registered clients.
   - The second line is expected to contain a space-separated list of integers representing the parameter `t` for each customer.
   - These inputs are handled via `input()` and `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which correctly parse the input into a list of integers.

2. **Counting Frequencies:**
   - A dictionary `a` is initialized to count the frequency of each possible value in the range from `-10` to `10`.
   - The program iterates over the list of integers and updates the counts in the dictionary.

3. **Calculating Opposite Pairs:**
   - The program iterates over the range from `-10` to `0` and calculates the product of the counts of each number `i` and its opposite `-i`.
   - This ensures that all pairs of numbers that are additive inverses are counted.
   - Additionally, it accounts for the special case of `0` by calculating the combination of pairs of zeros using the formula `a[0] * (a[0] - 1) / 2`.

4. **Output:**
   - The final result is printed, which is the sum of the products of the counts of pairs of integers that are additive inverses, including the adjusted count for zeros.

### Summary:
The program correctly follows the problem description by:
- Accepting the correct input format.
- Properly counting the frequencies of each possible value.
- Calculating the number of opposite pairs correctly, including handling the special case of zero.
- Providing the correct output.

Thus, the program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.
