Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic for counting opposite couples. Specifically, the code only considers the counts of positive and negative pairs without properly handling the case where both positive and negative versions of the same number (like 0) are present. The code snippet only iterates through the range from -10 to -1, which means it misses the cases where 0 might appear multiple times, leading to an incorrect count.

For example, consider the input:

```
5
-3 3 0 0 3
```

The correct number of opposite couples should be 3 (pairs (-3, 3), (3, -3), and (0, 0)), but the given code would only count the pairs involving non-zero numbers and would miss the pair (0, 0), leading to an incorrect result.
