Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the number of opposite couples based on the provided problem description. Specifically, the following issues exist:

1. **Handling of Zero (0):**
   - The problem description states that 0 is considered opposite to itself. However, the program incorrectly handles zero by adding `a[0] * (a[0] - 1) / 2` to the final answer. This calculation counts the number of ways to choose 2 zeros from `a[0]` clients, which is not the correct approach. Instead, the correct way to handle zero would be to simply multiply `a[0]` by itself and divide by 2, as there are `a[0]^2 / 2` pairs of zeros.

2. **Range of `i`:**
   - The program uses a range from `-10` to `0` in the for loop to calculate the number of opposite couples. However, the problem requires checking both positive and negative values. The correct range should be from `-10` to `10`, but only considering pairs `(i, -i)` where `i` is not zero. This means the loop should run from `-10` to `10` and exclude zero.

### Corrected Program:

Here is a corrected version of the program that adheres to the problem description:

```python
def func():
    a = [0] * 21  # Create an array to store counts from -10 to 10
    n = int(input())  # Read the number of clients
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the list of parameters
    
    for num in t:
        a[num + 10] += 1  # Store the count of each parameter
    
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, 11):  # Iterate over positive numbers from 1 to 10
        ans += a[i] * a[-i + 10]  # Calculate pairs (i, -i)
    
    # Handle zero separately
    ans += a[10] * (a[10] - 1) // 2  # Calculate pairs of zeros
    
    print(ans)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Initialization:**
   - An array `a` of size 21 is initialized to store counts from -10 to 10. This is done by creating an array of 21 elements and setting each index to zero.

2. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of clients `n` is read.
   - The list of parameters `t` is read and converted to a list of integers.

3. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - For each parameter `num` in the list `t`, the corresponding index in `a` is incremented. Since the array is zero-indexed, `num + 10` is used to map the value to the correct index.

4. **Calculating Pairs:**
   - A loop runs from 1 to 10 to count pairs `(i, -i)`.
   - For each `i` in the range, `a[i] * a[-i + 10]` calculates the number of pairs of opposite values.

5. **Handling Zero:**
   - The number of pairs of zeros is calculated using the formula `a[10] * (a[10] - 1) // 2`.

6. **Output:**
   - The total number of opposite couples is printed.

This corrected program ensures that the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
