To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- The loop iterates over the range from -10 to 10, inclusive.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is within the range \([-10, 10]\).
- `a[i]` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(-10, 11):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Range of `i`:**
   - The loop will iterate through all integer values from -10 to 10, inclusive.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was within this range.

2. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range \([-10, 10]\).
   - After the last iteration, `i` was at its maximum value (10) because if it was less than 10, the loop would have continued.

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` was 10 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 11.
   - However, 11 is not within the range \([-10, 10]\), so the loop will terminate after the current iteration.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop condition checks if `i` is within the range \([-10, 10]\), and `i` is currently 10, the loop will not execute again because 11 is outside this range.

### Final State:
The loop cannot execute one more time because `i` is already at its upper limit (10) and the next value (11) is out of the specified range.

**State: **`i` is 10, `a[i]` is 0**
