The code snippet `print(ans)` simply prints the current value of the variable `ans`. No other operations are performed on `ans` or any other variables. Therefore, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is -10, `n` is the length of the list `t`, `a[t[i]]` is the count of each element in the list `t` that falls within the range from -10 to 10, `ans` is `ans + k * (k - 1) / 2`**
