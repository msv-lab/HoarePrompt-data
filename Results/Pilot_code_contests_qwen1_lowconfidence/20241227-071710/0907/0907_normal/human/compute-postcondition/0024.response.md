Output State: **`i` is -10, `n` is the length of the list `t`, `a[t[i]]` is the count of each element in the list `t` that falls within the range from -10 to 10, `ans` is the sum of `a[i] * a[-i]` for all `i` in the range from -10 to 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range from -10 to 0, meaning it will iterate 11 times (from -10 to -1).
- For each iteration, the value of `ans` is updated by adding `a[i] * a[-i]` to its current value.
- `a[i]` is the count of elements in `t` that are equal to `i`.
- `a[-i]` is the count of elements in `t` that are equal to `-i`.
- After all iterations, `ans` will be the sum of `a[i] * a[-i]` for all `i` in the range from -10 to 0.

If the loop does not execute (which would only happen if the range from -10 to 0 is invalid, but since the range is fixed, this scenario is not applicable), the values of the variables would remain as in the initial state:
- `i` would still be -10,
- `n` would still be the length of the list `t`,
- `a[t[i]]` would still be the count of elements in `t` that are -10,
- `ans` would still be 0.

Thus, the final output state captures the result of the loop execution after all iterations are completed.
