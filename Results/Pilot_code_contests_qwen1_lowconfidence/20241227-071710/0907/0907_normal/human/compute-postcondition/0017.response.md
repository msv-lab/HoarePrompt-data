The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or `a[t[i]]`. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`i` is in the range from -10 to 10, `n` is the length of the list `n`, `a[t[i]]` is the count of each element in the list `t` that falls within the range from -10 to 10; `ans` is 0**
