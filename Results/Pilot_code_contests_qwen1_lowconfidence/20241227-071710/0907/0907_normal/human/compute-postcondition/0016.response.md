Output State: **`i` is in the range from -10 to 10, `n` is the length of the list `n`, `a[t[i]]` is the count of each element in the list `t` that falls within the range from -10 to 10.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is in the range from -10 to 10, and `n` is a list of integers. The variable `a[k]` is 0 for every integer `k` in the range from -10 to 10.
- The loop iterates over the list `n`, where each iteration increments `a[t[i]]` by 1 for each `i` in the range of the length of `n`.
- After the loop executes, `i` will still be in the range from -10 to 10 because the loop only modifies the values within this range.
- The value of `n` becomes the length of the list `n` because the loop runs exactly `len(n)` times.
- The variable `a[t[i]]` will store the count of how many times each index `t[i]` appears in the range from -10 to 10. Since `t[i]` is an index into the list `a`, which has a fixed size of 21 (from -10 to 10 inclusive), `a[t[i]]` will increment for each occurrence of `t[i]` in the loop.

In the case where the loop does not execute (i.e., when `n` is an empty list), the values of the variables remain as follows:
- `i` is in the range from -10 to 10 (unchanged).
- `n` is an empty list (length is 0).
- `a[t[i]]` remains 0 for all indices `t[i]` in the range from -10 to 10 (unchanged).
