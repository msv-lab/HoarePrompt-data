`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which reads a line of text from the standard input and converts it to a string. The value of `i` remains within the range from -10 to 10, and for every integer `k` in this range, `a[k]` is still 0.

Output State: **`i` is in the range from -10 to 10; `n` is a string from the input; for every integer `k` in the range from -10 to 10, `a[k]` is 0.**
