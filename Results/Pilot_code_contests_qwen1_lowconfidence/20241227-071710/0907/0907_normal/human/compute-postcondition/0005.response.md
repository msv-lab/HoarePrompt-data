State at the end of the previous iteration: `i` is 10, `a[10]` is 0.

The for loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(-10, 11):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Let's break this down step by step:

1. The `range(-10, 11)` generates numbers from -10 to 10 inclusive.
2. Initially, `i` starts at -10 and increments by 1 until it reaches 10.
3. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 10.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the next value of `i` that the loop would generate, which is 11.

Since 11 is not within the range `-10` to `10`, the loop will not execute one more time.

However, for completeness, let's adjust the states assuming the loop were to continue hypothetically (which it won't):

- `i` would be incremented to 11.
- No changes needed for `a[10]` since the array index does not change during the loop iterations.

State: **`i` is 11, `a[10]` is 0**
