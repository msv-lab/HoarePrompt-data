According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is in the range from -10 to 10, and `n` is a positive integer (at least 1). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

To determine the new state, we need to consider the following:

1. Since `i` was in the range from -10 to 10 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
2. For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must be less than `n`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer and `i` was within the range from -10 to 10, the new value of `i` will still be within this range or potentially outside it depending on the exact value of `i` and `n`.

Let's assume the worst-case scenario where `i` was at its maximum value, 10. If `n` is greater than 10, then `i + 1` would still be less than `n` and the loop would continue.

Therefore, the new state for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`i` is in the range from -10 to 9, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1)**

However, to be precise and cover all cases, we should state that `i` will be incremented by 1 and check if it is still less than `n`.

State: **`i` is in the range from -10 to 9, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1)**
