The code `t = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and then converts each element to an integer. Since `n` is a string from the input, it gets split and converted to a list of integers. 

- `i` remains unchanged and is still within the range from -10 to 10.
- `n` originally was a string, but now it has been transformed into a list of integers.
- `a` remains unchanged, with all its values being 0.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `i` is in the range from -10 to 10.
- `n` is a list of integers.
- `a[k]` is 0 for every integer `k` in the range from -10 to 10.

Output State: **`i` is in the range from -10 to 10; `n` is a list of integers; `a[k]` is 0 for every integer `k` in the range from -10 to 10.**
