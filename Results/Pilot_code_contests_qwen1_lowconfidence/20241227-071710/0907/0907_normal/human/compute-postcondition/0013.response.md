The code `a[t[i]] += 1` increments the value of `a[t[i]]` by 1. Here, `i` is in the range from -10 to 9, and `n` is a positive integer. The variable `t` is not defined in the initial state, and neither is `a`. Since the exact values of `t[i]` and `a` are not specified, we can only say that `a[t[i]]` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is in the range from -10 to 9, `n` is a positive integer, `a[t[i]]` is incremented by 1.**
