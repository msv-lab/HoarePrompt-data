`ans` is updated by adding `a[i] * a[-i]` to its current value. Given that `i` is -10, we need to determine the values of `a[i]` and `a[-i]`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `a[t[i]]` is the count of each element in the list `t` that falls within the range from -10 to 10.
- Since `i` is -10, `a[i]` is the count of elements in `t` that are -10.
- Similarly, `a[-i]` is the count of elements in `t` that are 10.

Let's denote:
- `count_of_minus_10` as the number of times -10 appears in `t`.
- `count_of_10` as the number of times 10 appears in `t`.

So, `a[i] = count_of_minus_10` and `a[-i] = count_of_10`.

Given `ans` is initially 0, the new value of `ans` will be `0 + count_of_minus_10 * count_of_10`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is -10, `n` is the length of the list `t`, `a[t[i]]` is the count of each element in the list `t` that falls within the range from -10 to 10, `ans` is count_of_minus_10 * count_of_10.**
