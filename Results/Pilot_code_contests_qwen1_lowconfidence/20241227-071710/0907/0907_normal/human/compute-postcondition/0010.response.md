Let's break down the given situation step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is in the range from -10 to 10.
   - `n` is a list of integers.
   - `a[k]` is 0 for every integer `k` in the range from -10 to 10.

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The for loop iterates over `range(n)`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and `n` should be at least 1 for the loop to start).

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is already in a specific range (-10 to 10), we don't need to adjust this.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is a positive integer, as `range(n)` requires `n` to be at least 1.
   - We don't need to adjust `a[k]` because the problem statement specifies that `a[k]` is 0 for all `k` in the specified range, and this doesn't affect the execution of the loop.

4. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - `i` is in the range from -10 to 10.
   - `n` must be a positive integer (at least 1).
   - `a[k]` remains 0 for every integer `k` in the range from -10 to 10.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`i` is in the range from -10 to 10, `n` must be a positive integer (at least 1), `a[k]` is 0 for every integer `k` in the range from -10 to 10**.
