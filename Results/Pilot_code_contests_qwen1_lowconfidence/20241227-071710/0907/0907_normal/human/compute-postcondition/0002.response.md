The code `a[i] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the element of list `a` at index `i`. Since `i` is in the range from -10 to 10 (inclusive), the value of `a[i]` is now `0`. The values of other variables and the condition of `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is in the range from -10 to 10, inclusive; `a[i]` is 0**
