The code snippet `a[t[i]] += 1` increments the value at index `t[i]` of the list `a` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `a`, `i`, and `t`. We know that `i` is in the range from -10 to 9 and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, but these conditions do not affect the list `a` or its indexing.

Since no specific values for `a`, `i`, and `t` are given, we can only say that `a[t[i]]` has been incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state descriptions.

Output State: **`i` is in the range from -10 to 9, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, and `a[t[i]]` has been incremented by 1.**
