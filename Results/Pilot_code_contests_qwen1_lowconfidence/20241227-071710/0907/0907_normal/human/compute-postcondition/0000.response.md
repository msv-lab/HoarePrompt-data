The code `a = dict()` creates an empty dictionary and assigns it to the variable `a`. This operation does not affect the values of `t` or any other existing variables. Therefore, the only change is that `a` now holds an empty dictionary.

Output State: **The input is a list of integers representing the parameter t for each customer, where the length of the list is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and each element ti satisfies -10 ≤ ti ≤ 10; `a` is an empty dictionary.**
