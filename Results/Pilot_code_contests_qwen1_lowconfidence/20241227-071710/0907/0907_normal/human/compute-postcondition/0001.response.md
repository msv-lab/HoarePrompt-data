According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the range from -10 to 10, inclusive. Since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to adjust the state related to the list `t` or the dictionary `a`.

To ensure the loop executes correctly, we need to confirm that the variable `i` takes values from -10 to 10, inclusive. Given the initial state provided, we don't need to make any adjustments to the list `t` or the dictionary `a` since they are not involved in the loop's execution.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be considered is the range of values `i` will take, which is already defined in the loop itself.

State: **`i` is in the range from -10 to 10, inclusive**
