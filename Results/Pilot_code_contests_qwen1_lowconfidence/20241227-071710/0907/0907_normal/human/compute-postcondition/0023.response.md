First, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

- Initial State: `i` is -8, `n` is the length of the list `t`, `a[t[i]]` is the count of elements in `t` that fall within the range from -10 to 10, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `a[-9] * a[9]`.

- Code Snippet: `ans += a[i] * a[-i]`

Given `i` is -8, we substitute `-i` with 8. Therefore, the code becomes:

`ans += a[-8] * a[8]`

Now, let's determine the values of `a[-8]` and `a[8]` using the initial state information:

- `a[t[i]]` is the count of elements in `t` that fall within the range from -10 to 10.

Since `i` is -8, `a[t[-8]]` is the count of elements in `t` that fall within the range from -10 to 10.

However, the exact value of `a[-8]` and `a[8]` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot compute their specific values without additional information about the list `t`. 

Thus, the updated `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `a[-8] * a[8]`.

Output State: **`i` is -8, `n` is the length of the list `t`, `a[t[-8]]` is the count of elements in `t` that fall within the range from -10 to 10, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `a[-8] * a[8]`.**
