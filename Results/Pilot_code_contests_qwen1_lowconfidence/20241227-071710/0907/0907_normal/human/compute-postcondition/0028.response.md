Functionality: **The function `func` accepts a list of integers representing the parameter `t` for each customer. It checks if all values in the list fall within the range `-10 ≤ ti ≤ 10`. If any value is outside this range, the function raises an error. If all values are within the specified range, the function calculates a specific output based on the counts of pairs of integers that are additive inverses (i.e., if `a` is in the list, then `-a` is also counted towards the result). The final output is the sum of the products of the counts of these pairs plus the adjusted count for zero (if it appears in the list). If zero appears more than once, the adjusted count considers combinations of zero pairs.**

Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where the input list `t` is empty. This would result in a division by zero error in the calculation of `ans` when `a[0]` is considered.
- The function does not provide a clear error message or indication for the case where the input list `t` is empty. It simply proceeds with the calculations, which might lead to incorrect results or errors due to division by zero.
- The function does not explicitly check for the type of the input. While the code expects a list of integers, if non-integer types are provided, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
