Output State: **`i` is in the range from -10 to 10, inclusive; for every integer `k` in this range, `a[k]` is 0.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range from -10 to 10, inclusive.
- For each value of `i` in this range, the dictionary `a` is updated to set `a[i]` to 0.
- Since the loop runs for all values in the range, after the loop completes, `a` will have keys from -10 to 10, and all corresponding values will be 0.
- If the loop does not execute (which would only happen if the range from -10 to 10 is not being traversed, but in this case, the loop always executes as specified), the values in `a` will still be set according to the loop, meaning all keys from -10 to 10 will have a value of 0.
