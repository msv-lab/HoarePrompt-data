The code `a[t[i]] += 1` increments the value of `a[t[i]]` by 1. Here, `t[i]` is an index into the list `a`, and `a` is initialized such that `a[k]` is 0 for every integer `k` in the range from -10 to 10. The value of `i` is in the range from -10 to 10, and `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), which is not affected by this line of code.

Since `a[k]` is initially 0 for all `k` in the range from -10 to 10, the specific value of `a[t[i]]` will become 1 after the increment. The value of `i` is in the range from -10 to 10, and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is in the range from -10 to 10, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `a[t[i]]` is 1**
