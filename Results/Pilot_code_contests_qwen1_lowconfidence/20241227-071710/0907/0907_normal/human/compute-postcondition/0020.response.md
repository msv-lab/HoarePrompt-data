Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We know that at the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is -10.
   - `a[t[i]]` is the count of each element in the list `t` that falls within the range from -10 to 10.
   - `ans` is updated by adding `a[i] * a[-i]` to its current value.

2. **For Loop**: The loop iterates over `i` in the range from -10 to 0 (exclusive). This means the loop will run from -10 to -1.

3. **Current Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is -10. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should increment to -9.

4. **Updating States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to -9.
   - We need to calculate the new value of `ans` based on the new value of `i`. The new value of `ans` will be the sum of `ans` from the previous iteration and `a[i] * a[-i]` where `i` is now -9.
   - `a[i]` for `i = -9` is the count of elements in `t` that are -9.
   - `a[-i]` for `i = -9` is the count of elements in `t` that are 9.

5. **New State**: After the next iteration of the loop:
   - `i` will be -9.
   - `ans` will be the previous value of `ans` plus the product of `a[-9]` and `a[9]`.

Given these steps, the adjusted states are:

**State: `i` is -9, `n` is the length of the list `t`, `a[t[i]]` is the count of each element in the list `t` that falls within the range from -10 to 10, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `a[-9] * a[9]`.**

However, since the exact values of `a[-9]` and `a[9]` are not provided, the general form of the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is -9, `n` is the length of the list `t`, `a[t[i]]` is the count of each element in the list `t` that falls within the range from -10 to 10, `ans` is updated by adding `a[-9] * a[9]` to its current value.**
