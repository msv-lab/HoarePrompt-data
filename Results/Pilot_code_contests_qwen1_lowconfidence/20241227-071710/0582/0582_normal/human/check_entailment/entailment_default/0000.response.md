Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` and the overall logic do not correctly calculate the number of distinct names among the k-sons of a given person. Here are a few key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of k-ancestors**: The code attempts to traverse the tree and collect k-ancestors, but the logic for traversing and collecting the correct set of k-sons is flawed. The current implementation does not properly handle the traversal and collection of k-sons for each query.

2. **Incorrect Merging of Sets**: The merging of sets in the `ans` dictionary is overly complex and does not correctly aggregate the distinct names of k-sons. The logic for merging sets between parent and child nodes is incorrect and can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Missing Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases such as when a person has no direct or indirect ancestors, or when the k-ancestor level is greater than the actual depth of the tree.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
