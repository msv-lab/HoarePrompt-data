You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarpus got hold of a family tree. The found tree describes the family relations of n people, numbered from 1 to n. Every person in this tree has at most one direct ancestor. Also, each person in the tree has a name, the names are not necessarily unique.

We call the man with a number a a 1-ancestor of the man with a number b, if the man with a number a is a direct ancestor of the man with a number b.

We call the man with a number a a k-ancestor (k > 1) of the man with a number b, if the man with a number b has a 1-ancestor, and the man with a number a is a (k - 1)-ancestor of the 1-ancestor of the man with a number b.

In the tree the family ties do not form cycles. In other words there isn't a person who is his own direct or indirect ancestor (that is, who is an x-ancestor of himself, for some x, x > 0).

We call a man with a number a the k-son of the man with a number b, if the man with a number b is a k-ancestor of the man with a number a.

Polycarpus is very much interested in how many sons and which sons each person has. He took a piece of paper and wrote m pairs of numbers vi, ki. Help him to learn for each pair vi, ki the number of distinct names among all names of the ki-sons of the man with number vi.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of people in the tree. Next n lines contain the description of people in the tree. The i-th line contains space-separated string si and integer ri (0 ≤ ri ≤ n), where si is the name of the man with a number i, and ri is either the number of the direct ancestor of the man with a number i or 0, if the man with a number i has no direct ancestor. 

The next line contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 105) — the number of Polycarpus's records. Next m lines contain space-separated pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers vi, ki (1 ≤ vi, ki ≤ n).

It is guaranteed that the family relationships do not form cycles. The names of all people are non-empty strings, consisting of no more than 20 lowercase English letters.

Output

Print m whitespace-separated integers — the answers to Polycarpus's records. Print the answers to the records in the order, in which the records occur in the input.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where a person can have multiple names correctly. Specifically, the program assumes that each person has a unique name, which is not necessarily true according to the problem description. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
6
valera 0
valera 1
valera 1
gerald 0
valera 4
kolya 4
7
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
4 1
5 1
6 1
```

In this case, the person with number 1, 2, and 4 all have the name "valera". However, the program will treat each occurrence of "valera" as a different name, leading to incorrect results. For instance, for the query `1 1`, the program should output `3` because there are three distinct names ("valera") among the 1-sons of the man with number 1. However, the program will output `1` because it does not account for the multiple occurrences of the same name.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the requirement of counting distinct names among the k-sons of a given person, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

n = int(raw_input())

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
