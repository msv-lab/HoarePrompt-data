Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to count the number of distinct names among all names of the k-sons of the man with number \( v_i \). Specifically, the following issues are present:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Ancestors and Sons**: The function `func_1` does not correctly manage the traversal and counting of distinct names for k-sons. The code uses sets (`{}`) to store names but does not properly aggregate the distinct names across all levels of ancestors.

2. **Merging Sets**: The merging logic for sets in `ans` is flawed. The code attempts to merge sets in a way that does not ensure the distinctness of names across different k-ancestors.

3. **Query Processing**: The query processing part of the code does not correctly handle the accumulation and merging of names for different k-ancestor levels. The logic to update `answer` based on the merged sets is not implemented correctly.

Given these issues, the code fails to produce the correct output for the given problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
