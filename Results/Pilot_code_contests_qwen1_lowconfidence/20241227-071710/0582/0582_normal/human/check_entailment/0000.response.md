Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the `func_1` function and related logic for counting distinct names among the k-sons of a given person do not handle the recursive nature of the problem correctly.

Here are the issues:

1. **Recursive Nature Not Fully Handled**: The function `func_1` attempts to recursively process nodes but does not properly accumulate and combine the results for all k-sons across different levels of recursion. This leads to incorrect counts for the number of distinct names among the k-sons.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Queries**: The program processes queries using a nested set approach, which may lead to incorrect results due to the way sets and dictionaries are updated and combined.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
6
pasha 0
gerald 1
gerald 1
valera 2
igor 3
olesya 1
5
1 1
1 2
1 3
3 1
6 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
2
0
1
0
```

**Actual Output:**
The program may produce incorrect outputs due to the flawed logic in handling recursive queries and accumulating results.

Given these issues, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description, hence the output is **False**.
