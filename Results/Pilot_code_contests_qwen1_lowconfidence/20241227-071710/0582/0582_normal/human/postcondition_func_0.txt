The function `func_1` processes a list of tuples `x`, where each tuple contains a name (string) and an integer (representing the direct ancestor's index or 0 if no ancestor), and a list of pairs `dep` of integers (vi, ki) representing the person's index and the k-ancestor level to query. It traverses the tree structure defined by `x` and calculates the set of names for each queried k-ancestor level, storing these sets in the dictionary `ans`. After the traversal, the function ensures that the dictionary `ans` contains the merged sets of names for all ancestors up to the root node for the root node itself, and for other nodes, it contains the sets of names for their respective depths. If the k-ancestor does not exist, it sets the corresponding value in the `answer` array to 0. The function handles edge cases such as when a node has no children or when the k-ancestor level exceeds the available depth.
