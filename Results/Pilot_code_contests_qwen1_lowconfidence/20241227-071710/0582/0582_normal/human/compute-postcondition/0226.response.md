The code updates the value of `answer[j]` to be the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`. Let's break down the steps:

1. `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`.
2. `x` is assigned the value of `fa[x]`.
3. `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`.
4. The value of `answer[j]` is updated to `len(ans[x][dep + i])`.

After these steps, the following changes occur:
- The value of `i` is set to `query[x][nowlistindex]`.
- The value of `x` is set to `fa[x]`.
- The value of `j` remains unchanged from its original value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`.
- The value of `answer[j]` is now `len(ans[x][dep + i])`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`query[x][nowlistindex]` is assigned to `i`; `x` is the value of `fa[x]` and `fa[x]` must not be `-1`; `i` is the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`; `j` is the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`; `answer[j]` is `len(ans[x][dep + i])`**
