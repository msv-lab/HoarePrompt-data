`ans[x][j].clear()` clears the list at `ans[x][j]`. This means that the contents of the list located at `ans[x][j]` are removed. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nowlistindex` is `len(query[x]) - 2`, `i` is the last element in `query[x]` before every second element, `j` is the next element in `ans[fa[x]]` after the previous `j`, `ans[x][j]` is an empty list, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the bitwise OR of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`**
