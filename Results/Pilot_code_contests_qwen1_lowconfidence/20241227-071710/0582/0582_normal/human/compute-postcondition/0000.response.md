Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the initial state step by step.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while x != -1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means that the loop will continue as long as `x` is not equal to `-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name (string) and an integer (representing the direct ancestor's index or 0 if no ancestor).
- `dep` is a list of pairs of integers (vi, ki) representing the person's index and the k-ancestor level to query.

To determine whether the loop can execute at least once, we need to check the condition `x != -1`. The initial state provided does not directly give us the value of `x`, but rather describes what `x` consists of. Since `x` is a list of tuples, the condition `x != -1` is a comparison between a list and a scalar value (`-1`). This comparison will always evaluate to `False` because a list cannot be equal to a scalar value.

Therefore, the initial state of `x` being a list of tuples is not sufficient to satisfy the condition `x != -1`. To make the loop execute at least once, `x` must be initialized in such a way that it is not equal to `-1`.

Since the problem does not provide any specific initialization or value for `x` other than it being a list of tuples, we need to assume that `x` should be initialized to something other than `-1` for the loop to proceed.

State: **`x` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name (string) and an integer (representing the direct ancestor's index or 0 if no ancestor), and `x` must not be equal to -1**
