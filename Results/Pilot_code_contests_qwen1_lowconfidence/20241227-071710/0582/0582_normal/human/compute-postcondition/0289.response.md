`ans[x][j]` is updated to include the bitwise OR of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The values of `fa[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` are unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `fa[x]` is not `-1`, `ans[fa[x]]` must contain at least one element; `ans[x][j]` is the bitwise OR of its previous value and `ans[fa[x]][j]`.

Output State: **`fa[x]` is not `-1`, `ans[fa[x]]` must contain at least one element; `ans[x][j]` is the bitwise OR of its previous value and `ans[fa[x]][j]`**
