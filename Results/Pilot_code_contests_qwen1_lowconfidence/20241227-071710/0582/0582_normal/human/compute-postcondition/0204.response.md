`dep` is incremented by 1. The value of `nowChild[x]` and `lenChild[x]` remains unchanged, and `x` remains equal to `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`. Therefore, the output state is: `nowChild[x]` is an integer, `lenChild[x]` is an integer, `x` is `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, and `dep` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`nowChild[x]` is an integer, `lenChild[x]` is an integer, `x` is `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `dep` is increased by 1**
