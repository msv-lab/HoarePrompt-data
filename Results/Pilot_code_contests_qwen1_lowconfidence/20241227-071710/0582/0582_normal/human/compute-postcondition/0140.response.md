Postcondition: ***`ans[x]` is non-empty; `i` is the last element of `query[x]` at even indices; `j` is the last element of `query[x]` at odd indices; `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to the length of `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged and is at least as long as the length of `ans[x][j]`.***
