The code `ans[x][j].clear()` clears the list `ans[x][j]`. This means that all elements in `ans[x][j]` are removed. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, `fa[x]` must not be `-1`, `ans[x]` must contain at least one element, `ans[x][j]` is an empty list, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`**
