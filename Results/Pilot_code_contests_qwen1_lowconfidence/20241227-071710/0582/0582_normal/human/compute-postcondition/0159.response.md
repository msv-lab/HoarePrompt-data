Postcondition: ***`ans[x]` must be non-empty, `i` is the next element of `query[x]` at even indices, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` at odd indices. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, if `len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the result of the bitwise OR operation between `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated to the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]`.***
