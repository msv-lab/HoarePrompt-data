Postcondition: ***`nowlistindex` is `len(query[x]) - 2`, `i` is the last element in `query[x]` before every second element, `j` is `j + 1`, `len(ans[x])` is greater than 0 and is less than `len(ans[fa[x]])`. If `len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[x][j]` is cleared and `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated to `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is set to `ans[x][j]` if `len(ans[x][j]) >= len(ans[fa[x]][j])` holds true.***

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts of the if-else block, ensuring that all possible outcomes are covered while maintaining the integrity of the precondition.
