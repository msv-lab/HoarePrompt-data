Postcondition: ***`ans[x]` must be non-empty, `i` is the last element of `query[x]` at even indices, `j` is the first element in `ans[x]` at odd indices. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to include all bits that are set in `ans[x][j]` via a bitwise OR operation, and `ans[x][j]` becomes an empty set. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated to `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
