The code `ans[x][dep] = {ss[x]}` assigns the value `{ss[x]}` to the element in the list `ans[x][dep]`. Given the initial state where `x` is the value of `fa[x]` and `fa[x]` must not be `-1`, the following changes occur:

- `ans[x][dep]` is assigned the set containing `ss[x]`.
- The other elements of `ans` and `fa` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is the value of `fa[x]` and `fa[x]` must not be `-1`; `ans[x][dep]` is the set containing `ss[x]`**
