Postcondition: ***`query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the value of `fa[x]` and `fa[x]` must not be `-1`, `ans[x]` must contain at least one element, and `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`. If `len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[x][j]` is cleared and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared and `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged.***
