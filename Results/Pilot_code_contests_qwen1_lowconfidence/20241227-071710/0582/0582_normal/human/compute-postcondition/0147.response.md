`ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` clears the contents of the list at `ans[fa[x]][j]`. This operation affects only the specified list, and no other variables are directly modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`ans[x][j]` is `val_x_j | val_fa_x_j`, `i` is the last element of `query[x]` at even indices, `j` is the first element in `ans[x]` at odd indices, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list.**
