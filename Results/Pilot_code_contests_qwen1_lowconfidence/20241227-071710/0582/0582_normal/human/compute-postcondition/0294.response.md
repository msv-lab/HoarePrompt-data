Postcondition: ***`fa[x]` is not `-1`, `ans[fa[x]]` contains at least one element. If `len(ans[x][j]) > len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[x][j]` is no longer valid. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated by performing a bitwise OR operation with `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` becomes equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`***
