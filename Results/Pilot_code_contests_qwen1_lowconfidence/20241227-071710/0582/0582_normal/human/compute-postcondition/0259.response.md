The code `ans[fa[x]][j] = ans[x][j]` assigns the value of `ans[x][j]` to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Here's the step-by-step impact:

1. `fa[x]` must not be `-1` and `x` is the value of `fa[x]`.
2. `ans[x][j]` is defined and contains some elements (since `ans[x]` must contain at least one element).
3. `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list initially.

After executing the code, `ans[fa[x]][j]` will now contain the same elements as `ans[x][j]`.

Output State: **`query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the value of `fa[x]` and `fa[x]` must not be `-1`, `ans[x]` must contain at least one element; `ans[fa[x]][j]` now contains the same elements as `ans[x][j]`.**
