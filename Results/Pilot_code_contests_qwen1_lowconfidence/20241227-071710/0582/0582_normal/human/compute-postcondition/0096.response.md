Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of tuples. `nowlistindex` is `len(query[x]) - 2`, `i` is the last element in `query[x]` before every second element, and `j` is the element processed in `ans[fa[x]]`. After the if-else block executes:
- If `len(ans[x]) < len(ans[fa[x]])`, then for each `j` in `ans[x]`, if `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` equals `ans[x][j]`. If `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to the union of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is cleared.
- Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]]` contains the contents of `ans[x]`, and `ans[x]` contains the union of all relevant elements from `ans[fa[x]]` according to the conditions in the loop.***
