Postcondition: ***`query[x][nowlistindex]` is assigned to `i`; `x` is the value of `fa[x]` and `fa[x]` must not be `-1`; `j` is the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`; `answer[j]` is either `0` or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` depending on whether `dep + i` is in `ans[x]` or not.***

Explanation:
- If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is set to `0`.
- If `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is set to the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.

This covers both the if and else parts of the condition, providing a comprehensive postcondition that describes the final state of the variables after the if-else block executes.
