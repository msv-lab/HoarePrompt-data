The code `ans[fa[x]][j] = ans[x][j]` assigns the value of `ans[x][j]` to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Here, `fa[x]` is some specific index, `i` is the next element of `query[x]` at even indices, and `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` at odd indices. The values of these variables are not directly modified by this code, only `ans` is updated.

Output State: **`ans[x]` must be non-empty, `i` is the next element of `query[x]` at even indices, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` at odd indices, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]`**
