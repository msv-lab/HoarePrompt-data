Postcondition: ***`query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the value of `fa[x]` and `fa[x]` must not be `-1`, `ans[x]` must contain at least one element. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is unchanged and `ans[x][j]` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated to `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`, making it the concatenation of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
