The code assigns the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` to `ans[x][j]`. Given that `fa[x]` is not `-1` and `ans[fa[x]]` must contain at least one element, the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is copied to `ans[x][j]`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`fa[x]` is not `-1`, `ans[fa[x]]` must contain at least one element, `ans[x][j]` is equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`**
