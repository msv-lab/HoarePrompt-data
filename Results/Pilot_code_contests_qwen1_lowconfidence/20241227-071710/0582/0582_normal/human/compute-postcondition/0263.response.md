`ans[x]` is cleared, meaning that the list at index `x` in the `ans` list is set to an empty list. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `ans` or `x`. Therefore, we can only say that the list at index `x` in the `ans` list is now an empty list.

Output State: **`ans` is a list with at least one element, and the element at index `x` is an empty list**
