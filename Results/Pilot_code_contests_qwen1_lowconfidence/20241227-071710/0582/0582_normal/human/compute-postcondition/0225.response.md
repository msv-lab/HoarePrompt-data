`answer[j]` is assigned the value `0`. This directly updates the value of `answer[j]` from its previous state (either `0` or the length of `ans[x][dep + (k + 2)]`) to `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`query[x][nowlistindex]` is assigned to `i`; `x` is the value of `fa[x]` and `fa[x]` must not be `-1`; `i` is the value of `query[x][k + 2]`; `j` is the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`; `answer[j]` is `0`.**
