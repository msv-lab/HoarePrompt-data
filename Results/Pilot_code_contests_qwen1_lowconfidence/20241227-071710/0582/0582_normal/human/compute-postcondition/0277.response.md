Postcondition: ***`fa[x]` is not `-1`, `ans[fa[x]]` must have at least one element. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If `j` is in `ans[x]`, then either `ans[x][j]` is updated to the union of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` becomes an empty list, or `ans[x][j]` is set to `[0]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged.***
