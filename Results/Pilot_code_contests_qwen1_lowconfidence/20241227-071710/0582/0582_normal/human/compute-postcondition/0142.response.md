To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information provided and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `ans[x]` must be non-empty.
  - `i` is the last element of `query[x]` at even indices.
  - `j` is the last element of `query[x]` at odd indices.
  - If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is set to `ans[x][j]`.
  - If `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, then the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to the length of `ans[x][j]` if it is shorter, otherwise it remains unchanged and is at least as long as the length of `ans[x][j]`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in ans[x]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop iterates over each element `j` in `ans[x]`. For the loop to continue executing, there must be at least one element in `ans[x]`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Determine the Condition for Continuing the Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `ans[x]` is non-empty.

2. **Current State:**
   - `ans[x]` is non-empty (this is guaranteed by the given condition).

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will iterate over the first element in `ans[x]` (let's call this element `j1`).
   - After processing `j1`, the loop will proceed to the next element in `ans[x]` (if any).

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since `ans[x]` is non-empty, we know there is at least one element to process.
   - The value of `j` will change to the first element in `ans[x]` for the next iteration.

### Conclusion:
- `ans[x]` remains non-empty.
- `i` and `j` are not directly modified by the loop; they depend on the current element being processed.
- The only state that changes is `j`, which becomes the first element in `ans[x]`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`ans[x]` must be non-empty, `i` is the last element of `query[x]` at even indices, `j` is the first element in `ans[x]` at odd indices.**

This ensures that the loop can execute one more time, processing the first element in `ans[x]`.
