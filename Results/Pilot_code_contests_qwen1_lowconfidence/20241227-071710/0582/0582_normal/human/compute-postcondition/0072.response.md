Postcondition: **`nowlistindex` is `len(query[x]) - 2`, `i` is the last element in `query[x]` before every second element, `j` is the element right after `i` in `query[x]`, and the length of `ans[fa[x]]` is greater than 0, `j` is in `ans[x]`; if `len(ans[x][j]) > len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list; otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.**
