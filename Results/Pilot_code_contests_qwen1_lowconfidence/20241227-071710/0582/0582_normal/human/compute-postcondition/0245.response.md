`ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. This means that the value at the `j`-th index of `ans[fa[x]]` is set to the value at the same index of `ans[x]`. The conditions mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the value of `fa[x]` and `fa[x]` must not be `-1`, `ans[x]` must contain at least one element, `ans[fa[x]]` is updated such that its `j`-th element is now equal to the `j`-th element of `ans[x]`**
