`nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1. This changes the value of `nowChild[x]`, but the initial conditions regarding `x`, `fa[x]`, `query[x]`, `answer[j]`, and the structure of `ans` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is the value of `fa[x]`, `fa[x]` must not be `-1`. If `x != 0`, `query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, and for each `j` in `query[x]`, `answer[j]` is either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` where `i` is an element in `query[x]` such that `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`. If `len(ans[x]) < len(ans[fa[x]])`, then `ans` is a list with at least one element, and the element at index `x` is an empty list. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]]` contains the union of all elements from `ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[x]` (which is just `ans[x]` since `ans[fa[x]]` was initially empty), and `ans[x]` contains the union of all elements from `ans[fa[x]]`. `nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1.**
