Postcondition: ***`ans[x][dep]` contains the set `{ss[x]}`, `nowlistindex` is `len(query[x]) - 2`, `i` is the last element of `query[x]` at even indices, `j` is the last element of `query[x]` at odd indices, for each `j` where the corresponding `i` is processed, `answer[j]` is 0 if `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` if it is in `ans[x]`, the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, and `ans[fa[x]]` must contain at least one element. `j` is not in `ans[x]`***
