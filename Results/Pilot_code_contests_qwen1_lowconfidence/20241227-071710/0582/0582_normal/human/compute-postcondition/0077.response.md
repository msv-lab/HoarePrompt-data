The code snippet `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` clears the set stored at `ans[fa[x]][j]`. This means that all elements previously in the set at `ans[fa[x]][j]` are removed.

- The value of `nowlistindex` remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged.
- The value of `j` remains unchanged.
- The value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now an empty set.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`nowlistindex` is `len(query[x]) - 2`, `i` is the last element in `query[x]` before every second element, `j` is the next element in `ans[fa[x]]` after the current `j`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty set.**
