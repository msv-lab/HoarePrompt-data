The code `ans[x][j] |= ans[fa[x]][j]` updates the value of `ans[x][j]` by performing a bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`. 

- `ans[x]` must be non-empty.
- `i` is the next element of `query[x]` at even indices.
- `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` at odd indices.

The code affects `ans[x][j]` by updating it with the result of the bitwise OR operation. However, the values of `i` and `fa[x]` remain unchanged, and the condition for `j` being the next element in `ans[x]` at odd indices also remains valid.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`ans[x]` must be non-empty, `i` is the next element of `query[x]` at even indices, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` at odd indices, and `ans[x][j]` is updated to the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`.**
