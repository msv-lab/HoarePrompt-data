Output State: **`x` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name (string) and an integer (representing the direct ancestor's index or 0 if no ancestor), and `x` must not be equal to -1; `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`; `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing `ss[x]`; the condition `x != 0` is satisfied.**
