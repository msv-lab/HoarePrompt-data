`dep` is incremented by 1. The value of `x` remains a tuple containing a name and an integer, and the variables `Child`, `nowChild`, and `lenChild` are unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a tuple containing a name and an integer; `Child` and `nowChild` and `lenChild` are unchanged; `dep` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple containing a name and an integer; `Child` and `nowChild` and `lenChild` are unchanged; `dep` is increased by 1.**
