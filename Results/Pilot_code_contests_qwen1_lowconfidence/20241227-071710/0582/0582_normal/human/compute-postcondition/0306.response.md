`dep` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables (`x`, `fa[x]`, `nowChild[x]`, and `lenChild[x]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `fa[x]` must not be `-1`, `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`, and `dep` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`x` is `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `fa[x]` must not be `-1`, `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`, and `dep` is increased by 1.**
