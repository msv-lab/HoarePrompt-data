The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `dep`.

- `x` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name (string) and an integer (representing the direct ancestor's index or 0 if no ancestor).
- `dep` is a list of pairs of integers (vi, ki), representing the person's index and the k-ancestor level to query.

Based on the input parameters, the function processes the queries to find the k-ancestor for each person specified in `dep`. If `dep` contains a pair (vi, ki), the function returns the name of the person at index `vi`'s ki-th ancestor. If the ancestor does not exist (e.g., the index is out of range or the k-ancestor does not exist), the behavior is not specified in the given information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of tuples `x` and a list of pairs `dep`, and for each pair (vi, ki) in `dep`, it returns the name of the k-ancestor of the person at index vi, or an appropriate message if the ancestor does not exist.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `x`, where each tuple contains a name (string) and an integer (representing the direct ancestor's index or 0 if no ancestor), and a list of pairs `dep` of integers (vi, ki) representing the person's index and the k-ancestor level to query. For each pair (vi, ki) in `dep`, it returns the name of the person at index `vi`'s ki-th ancestor, or an appropriate message if the ancestor does not exist.**
