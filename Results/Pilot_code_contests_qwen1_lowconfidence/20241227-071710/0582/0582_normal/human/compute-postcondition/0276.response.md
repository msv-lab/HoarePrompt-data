Postcondition: ***`fa[x]` is not `-1`, `ans[fa[x]]` must have at least one element, `j` is in `ans[x]`. If `len(ans[x][j]) > len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[x][j]` is updated to `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` becomes an empty list. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is `[0]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains `0`.***
