Postcondition: ***`query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the value of `fa[x]` and `fa[x]` must not be `-1`, for each `j` in `query[x]`, `answer[j]` is either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` where `i` is an element in `query[x]` such that `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`. Additionally, the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`***
