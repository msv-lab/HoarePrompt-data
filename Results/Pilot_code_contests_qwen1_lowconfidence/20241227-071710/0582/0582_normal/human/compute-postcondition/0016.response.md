`answer[j]` is assigned the value of `len(ans[x][dep + i])`. Given that `i` and `j` are both the third element in `query[x]`, the value of `i` and `j` is the same, let's denote this common value as `k`. Thus, `j` is `k` and `i` is also `k`.

The length `len(ans[x][dep + k])` will be calculated and assigned to `answer[k]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nowlistindex` is 2, `i` is `k`, `j` is `k`, `answer[j]` is `len(ans[x][dep + k])`**
