The code `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` clears the list `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Given the initial conditions, the value of `fa[x]` is not `-1` and `ans[x]` contains at least one element. The operation does not affect the value of `x` or `query[x]`, but it changes `ans[fa[x]][j]` to an empty list.

Output State: **`query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the value of `fa[x]` and `fa[x]` must not be `-1`, `ans[x]` must contain at least one element; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list.**
