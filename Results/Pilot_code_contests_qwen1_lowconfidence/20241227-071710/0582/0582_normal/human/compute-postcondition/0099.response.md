`dep` is decremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state of `nowlistindex`, `i`, `j`, and `nowChild[x]` are preserved.

Output State: **`x` is now `fa[x]`, `nowlistindex` is `len(query[x]) - 2`, `i` is the last element in `query[x]` before every second element, `j` is the element processed in `ans[fa[x]]`, `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1, `dep` is decreased by 1**
