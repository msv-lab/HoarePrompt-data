`ans[x][j].clear()` clears the list `ans[x][j]`. Given the initial state, the following conditions are met:

- `ans[x]` must be non-empty.
- `i` is the last element of `query[x]` at even indices.
- `j` is the last element of `query[x]` at odd indices.
- `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`.
- The length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the maximum of its original length and the length of `ans[x][j]`.

After executing `ans[x][j].clear()`, the list `ans[x][j]` is emptied, but the other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans[x]` is non-empty; `ans[x][j]` is an empty list; `i` is the last element of `query[x]` at even indices; `j` is the last element of `query[x]` at odd indices; `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`; the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the maximum of its original length and the length of `ans[x][j]`**
