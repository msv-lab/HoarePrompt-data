Postcondition: **`query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the value of `fa[x]` and `fa[x]` must not be `-1`, `ans[x]` must contain at least one element. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is equal to `ans[x][j]`. If `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]` and the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is cleared and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared and `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged.**
