The code `ans[x][j] = ans[fa[x]][j]` assigns the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` to `ans[x][j]`. Given the initial state where `fa[x]` is not `-1` and `ans[fa[x]]` must have at least one element, the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is copied to `ans[x][j]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `fa[x]` remains unchanged and is not `-1`.
- `ans[fa[x]]` must still have at least one element.
- `ans[x][j]` is now equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`.

Output State: **`fa[x]` is not `-1`, `ans[fa[x]]` must have at least one element, `ans[x][j]` is equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`**
