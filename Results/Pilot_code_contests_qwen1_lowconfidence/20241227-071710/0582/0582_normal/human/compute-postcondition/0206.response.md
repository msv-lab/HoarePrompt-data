To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and analyze the given information:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `x != -1`.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `x` is the value of `fa[x]`.
   - `ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[x]` both contain the set `{ss[x]}`.
   - `nowlistindex` is `len(query[x]) - 1`.
   - `i` is the last element of `query[x]` at even indices.
   - `j` is the last element of `query[x]` at odd indices.
   - For each `j` where the corresponding `i` is processed, `ans[x][j]` is equal to `{ss[x]}`.
   - The length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`.
   - `nowChild[x]` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged.
   - `dep` is either decreased by 1 or increased by 1.

To continue the loop, the only condition that matters here is the loop condition itself: `x != -1`.

Given that `x` is currently set to the value of `fa[x]`, the loop will continue as long as this value is not `-1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `x` is not `-1` for the loop to proceed.

Since `x` is currently the value of `fa[x]`, we need to make sure that `fa[x]` is not `-1`. If `fa[x]` were `-1`, then `x` would also be `-1`, and the loop would terminate.

Hence, we need to ensure that `fa[x]` is not `-1`.

**Adjusted States**:
- `x` should be the value of `fa[x]`, but `fa[x]` must not be `-1`.

**Final State**:
State: **`x` is the value of `fa[x]` and `fa[x]` must not be `-1`**
