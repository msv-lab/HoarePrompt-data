The code `ans[x][j].clear()` clears the list `ans[x][j]`. The previous state was that `fa[x]` is not `-1`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the result of `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]]` must have at least one element. After executing the code, the list `ans[x][j]` is emptied, but the other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`fa[x]` is not `-1`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the result of `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`, `ans[fa[x]]` must have at least one element, `ans[x][j]` is an empty list**
