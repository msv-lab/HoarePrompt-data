Postcondition: ***`x` is the value of `fa[x]` and `fa[x]` must not be `-1`. If `nowChild[x] == lenChild[x]`, then `query[x]` must have at least 2 elements when `x != 0`, and for each `j` in `query[x]`, `answer[j]` is either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` where `i` is an element in `query[x]` such that `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`. Additionally, `nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1 and `dep` is decreased by 1. If `nowChild[x] != lenChild[x]`, then `x` is `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`, and `dep` is increased by 1.***
