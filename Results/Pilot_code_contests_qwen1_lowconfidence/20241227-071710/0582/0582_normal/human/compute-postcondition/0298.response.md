The code `ans[fa[x]] = ans[x]` updates the content of `ans[fa[x]]` to be the same as `ans[x]`. This means that all elements in `ans[x]` are now also present in `ans[fa[x]]`. 

- The initial state is: `fa[x]` is not `-1`, `ans[fa[x]]` is an empty list, and `ans[x]` contains the union of all elements from `ans[fa[x]]` (which is initially an empty list).

After the code execution:
- `ans[fa[x]]` will be updated to be the same as `ans[x]`, which means it will contain the union of all elements from `ans[fa[x]]` (which is still an empty list) and the elements in `ans[x]`. However, since `ans[fa[x]]` was initially an empty list, it will now contain exactly what `ans[x]` contains.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`fa[x]` is not `-1`, `ans[fa[x]]` contains the union of all elements from `ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[x]` (which is just `ans[x]` since `ans[fa[x]]` was initially empty), and `ans[x]` contains the union of all elements from `ans[fa[x]]`**.
