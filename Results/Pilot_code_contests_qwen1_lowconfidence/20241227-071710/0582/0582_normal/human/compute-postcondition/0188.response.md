The code `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` clears the set `ans[fa[x]][j]`. This means that the set `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now empty.

- `ans[x][dep]` still contains the set `{ss[x]}`.
- `nowlistindex` is still `len(query[x]) - 1`.
- `i` is still the last element of `query[x]` at even indices.
- `j` is still the next element in `ans[fa[x]]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
**`ans[x][dep]` contains the set `{ss[x]}`, `nowlistindex` is `len(query[x]) - 1`, `i` is the last element of `query[x]` at even indices, `j` is the next element in `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty set.**
