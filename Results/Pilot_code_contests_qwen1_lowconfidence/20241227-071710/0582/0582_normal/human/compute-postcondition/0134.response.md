`ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to include the elements of `ans[x][j]`. Since `ans[x][j]` is non-empty, `ans[fa[x]][j]` will also contain these elements, effectively performing a union operation.

Given the conditions:
- `ans[x][j]` is non-empty.
- The length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.

After the operation, the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` will be the maximum length between `ans[fa[x]][j]` (which was initially longer) and `ans[x][j]` (which is non-empty but shorter).

Output State: **`ans[x]` must be non-empty, `i` is the last element of `query[x]` at even indices, `j` is the last element of `query[x]` at odd indices, `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, and the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the maximum of its original length and the length of `ans[x][j]`**
