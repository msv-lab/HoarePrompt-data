The code assigns the value of `Child[x][nowChild[x]]` to `x`. Given the initial state where `x` is the value of `fa[x]` and `fa[x]` is not `-1`, and `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`, the value of `x` changes to `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `fa[x]` must not be `-1`, and `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`**
