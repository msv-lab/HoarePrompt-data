Postcondition: ***`nowlistindex` is `len(query[x]) - 2`, `i` is the last element in `query[x]` before every second element, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` after the previous `j`, `len(ans[x])` is greater than 0 and is less than `len(ans[fa[x]])`. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` equals `ans[x][j]`. If `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` equals `ans[x][j]` and the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If `len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, `ans[x][j]` is cleared and `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated to the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is set to `ans[x][j]`.***
