Postcondition: **`nowlistindex` is `len(query[x]) - 2`, `i` is the last element in `query[x]` before every second element, `j` is the element right after `i` in `query[x]`, `len(ans[x])` must be greater than 0 and is less than `len(ans[fa[x]])`, the element `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`. If `len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[x][j]` is an empty list. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is equal to `ans[x][j]` and the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`**.
