The code snippet assigns the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` to `ans[x][j]`. Given the initial state, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the result of `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`, which means `ans[fa[x]][j]` already contains the combined result of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`. After this assignment, `ans[x][j]` will now have the same value as `ans[fa[x]][j]`.

The output state will reflect this change:

Output State: **`fa[x]` is not `-1`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the result of `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`, `ans[fa[x]]` must have at least one element, `ans[x][j]` is now equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`**
