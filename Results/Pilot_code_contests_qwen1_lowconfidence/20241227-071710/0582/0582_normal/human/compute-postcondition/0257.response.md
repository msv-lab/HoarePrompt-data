`ans[x][j]` is updated by performing a bitwise OR operation with `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The value of `x` is determined by `fa[x]`, and `fa[x]` is not `-1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the value of `fa[x]` and `fa[x]` must not be `-1`, `ans[x]` must contain at least one element; `ans[x][j]` is the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`**
