The code snippet `ans[fa[x]][j] |= ans[x][j]` performs a bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`. This means that each bit in `ans[fa[x]][j]` is set to 1 if either the corresponding bit in `ans[fa[x]][j]` or `ans[x][j]` is 1.

Given the initial state:
- `fa[x]` is not `-1`
- `ans[fa[x]]` must have at least one element

After executing the code:
- The value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to the result of `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`.

The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`fa[x]` is not `-1`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the result of `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`, `ans[fa[x]]` must have at least one element.**
