Postcondition: ***`query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the value of `fa[x]` and `fa[x]` must not be `-1`, `i` is the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`, `j` is the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`, and `answer[j]` is either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` depending on whether `dep + i` is in `ans[x]` or not. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is set to 0. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is set to the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.***
