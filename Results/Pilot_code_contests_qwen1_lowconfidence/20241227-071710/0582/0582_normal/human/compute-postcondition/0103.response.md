Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of tuples. If `nowChild[x]` equals `lenChild[x]`, then `x` is now `fa[x]`, `nowlistindex` is `len(query[x]) - 2`, `i` is the last element in `query[x]` before every second element, `j` is the element processed in `ans[fa[x]]`, `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1, and `dep` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged, `Child`, `nowChild`, and `lenChild` remain unchanged, and `dep` is increased by 1.***
