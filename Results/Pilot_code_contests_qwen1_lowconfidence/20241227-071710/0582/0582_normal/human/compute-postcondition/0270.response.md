`ans[x][j]` is updated by performing a bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Since the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, the resulting value of `ans[x][j]` will be the same as `ans[x][j]` after the operation, because the additional bits in `ans[x][j]` will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `fa[x]` is not -1, `ans[fa[x]]` must have at least one element, `j` is in `ans[x]`, and `ans[x][j]` is the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`.

Output State: **`fa[x]` is not -1, `ans[fa[x]]` must have at least one element, `j` is in `ans[x]`, and `ans[x][j]` is the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`**
