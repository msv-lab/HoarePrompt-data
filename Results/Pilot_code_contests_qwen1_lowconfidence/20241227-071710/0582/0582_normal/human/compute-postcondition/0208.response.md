Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop variable is `nowlistindex`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `len(query[x]) - 2` in steps of `2` (since the range function is `range(0, len(query[x]), 2)`).

2. **Determine the Initial State Needed for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `len(query[x])` must be at least `2` because the loop runs in steps of `2` and starts from `0`.

3. **Consider the Given States:**
   - `x` is the value of `fa[x]` and `fa[x]` must not be `-1`.
   - `ans[x][dep]` is the set containing `ss[x]`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop requires `query[x]` to have at least 2 elements, we need to adjust the state to reflect this.
   - The other given states (`x` and `ans[x][dep]`) do not directly affect the loop's execution but are part of the context.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `query[x]` must have at least 2 elements.
- `x` is the value of `fa[x]` and `fa[x]` must not be `-1`.

The final answer is:

State: **`query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the value of `fa[x]` and `fa[x]` must not be `-1`**
