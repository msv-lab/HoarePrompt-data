Output State: **`nowlistindex` is `len(query[x]) - 2`, `i` is the last element in `query[x]` before every second element, `j` is `j + 1`, `len(ans[x])` is greater than 0 and is less than `len(ans[fa[x]])`, `ans[x][j]` is updated to `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is equal to the cleared list.**
