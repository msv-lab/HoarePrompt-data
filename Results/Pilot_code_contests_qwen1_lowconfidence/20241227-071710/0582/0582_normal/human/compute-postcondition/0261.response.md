Postcondition: **`query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, `fa[x]` must not be `-1`, and `ans[x]` must contain at least one element. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, if the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to the union of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged and contains the same elements as `ans[x][j]`.**
