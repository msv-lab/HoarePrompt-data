The code `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` clears the list at `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Given the initial state, the value of `fa[x]` is not -1, and `ans[fa[x]]` must have at least one element. The value of `j` is in `ans[x]`, and `ans[x][j]` is the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`. After executing the code, the list `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared.

Output State: **`fa[x]` is not -1, `ans[fa[x]]` must have at least one element, `j` is in `ans[x]`, and `ans[x][j]` is the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list.**
