`answer[j]` is assigned the value `0`. From the initial state, we know `j` is the 5th element of `query[x]`. Therefore, `answer[j]` is now `0`.

Output State: **`ans[x][dep]` remains the same, `nowlistindex` is 4, `i` is the 4th element of `query[x]`, `j` is the 5th element of `query[x]`, `answer[j]` is 0**
