Postcondition: `nowlistindex` is `len(query[x]) - 2`, `i` is the last element in `query[x]` before every second element, `j` is the element right after `i` in `query[x]`, `len(ans[x])` must be greater than 0, and `len(ans[x])` is less than `len(ans[fa[x]])`. The element `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, and the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.
