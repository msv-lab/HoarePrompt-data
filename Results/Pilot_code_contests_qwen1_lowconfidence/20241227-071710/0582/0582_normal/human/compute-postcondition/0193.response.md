Postcondition: ***`ans[x][dep]` contains the set `{ss[x]}`, `nowlistindex` is `len(query[x]) - 1`, `i` is the last element of `query[x]` at even indices, `j` is the next element in `ans[fa[x]]`. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty set. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is either equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]` or updated to match `ans[fa[x]][j]`, ensuring that `ans[x][j]` always matches `ans[fa[x]][j]` in terms of set inclusion. The length of `ans[x]` remains greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, and `ans[fa[x]]` must contain at least one element.***
