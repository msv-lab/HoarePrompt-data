The code `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` clears the list at index `j` in the list `ans[fa[x]]`. Since `ans[fa[x]]` must contain at least one element, the list at index `j` is cleared, but no other variables are affected. The value of `fa[x]` remains unchanged, and `ans[x][j]` is no longer relevant since the list it references has been cleared.

Output State: **`fa[x]` is not `-1`, `ans[fa[x]]` contains at least one element but the list at index `j` is now empty, `ans[x][j]` is no longer valid**
