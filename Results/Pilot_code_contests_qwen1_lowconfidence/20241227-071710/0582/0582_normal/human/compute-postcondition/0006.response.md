`nowlistindex` is 0; `i` is the first element in `query[x]`. The code assigns `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]` to `j`. Since `nowlistindex` is 0, `nowlistindex + 1` is 1. Therefore, `j` is assigned the second element in `query[x]`. The value of `nowlistindex` remains unchanged, and the value of `i` remains the same.

Output State: **`nowlistindex` is 0; `i` is the first element in `query[x]`; `j` is the second element in `query[x]`**
