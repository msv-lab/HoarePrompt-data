`ans[x][j].clear()` clears the list at index `j` of `ans[x]`. This operation affects only the list at `ans[x][j]`, making it an empty list. The values of other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the value of `fa[x]` and `fa[x]` must not be `-1`, `ans[x]` must contain at least one element, `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, the length of `ans[x][j]` is now 0 (since it was cleared), and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`.**
