Postcondition: `nowlistindex` is `len(query[x]) - 2`, `i` is the last element in `query[x]` before every second element, `j` is the element right after `i` in `query[x]`, and the length of `ans[fa[x]]` is greater than 0; if `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If `j` is in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` if `len(ans[x][j]) <= len(ans[fa[x]][j])`; otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list.
