`ans[x][j]` is updated to be the bitwise OR of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`. This means every bit that is set in either `ans[x][j]` or `ans[fa[x]][j]` (or both) will be set in the new value of `ans[x][j]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the value of `fa[x]` and `fa[x]` must not be `-1`, `ans[x]` must contain at least one element, `ans[x][j]` is the bitwise OR of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`. The length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.**
