Postcondition: `nowlistindex` is `len(query[x]) - 2`, `i` is the last element in `query[x]` before every second element, `j` is the element right after `i` in `query[x]`, `len(ans[x])` is greater than 0 and is less than `len(ans[fa[x]])`, and either `ans[fa[x]][j]` is equal to `ans[x][j]` (if `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`) or `ans[fa[x]][j]` is equal to `ans[x][j]` and the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` (if `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`).
