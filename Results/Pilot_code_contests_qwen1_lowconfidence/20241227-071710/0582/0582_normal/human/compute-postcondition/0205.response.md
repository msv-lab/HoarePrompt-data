Postcondition: ***`x` is the value of `fa[x]`, `ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[x]` both contain the set `{ss[x]}`, `nowlistindex` is `len(query[x]) - 1`, `i` is the last element of `query[x]` at even indices, `j` is the last element of `query[x]` at odd indices, for each `j` where the corresponding `i` is processed, `ans[x][j]` is equal to `{ss[x]}`, and the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`; `nowChild[x]` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged (if the condition `nowChild[x] == lenChild[x]` is false); `dep` is either decreased by 1 (if the condition `nowChild[x] == lenChild[x]` is true) or increased by 1 (if the condition `nowChild[x] == lenChild[x]` is false).***
