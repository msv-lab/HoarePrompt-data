To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions and requirements:

1. **Condition on `fa[x]`:**
   - `fa[x]` must not be `-1`. This ensures that `ans[fa[x]]` is valid and contains at least one element.

2. **Condition on `ans[fa[x]]`:**
   - `ans[fa[x]]` must have at least one element. This ensures that the loop can iterate over its contents.

3. **Loop Variable `j`:**
   - The loop iterates over `ans[fa[x]]`, meaning `j` will take each element from `ans[fa[x]]`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `ans[fa[x]]` has at least one element for the loop to execute. Additionally, we need to account for the fact that `x` is set to `fa[x]` and `query[x]` must have at least 2 elements as per the initial state condition.

Let's summarize the required states:

- `fa[x]` must not be `-1`.
- `ans[fa[x]]` must have at least one element.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`fa[x]` is not `-1`, `ans[fa[x]]` must have at least one element**
