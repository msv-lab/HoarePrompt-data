`dep` is decremented by 1, which means the depth or level in the tree structure represented by the variables is reduced by 1. All other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `dep`.

Output State: **`x` is the value of `fa[x]`, `fa[x]` must not be `-1`. If `x != 0`, `query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, and for each `j` in `query[x]`, `answer[j]` is either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` where `i` is an element in `query[x]` such that `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`. If `len(ans[x]) < len(ans[fa[x]])`, then `ans` is a list with at least one element, and the element at index `x` is an empty list. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]]` contains the union of all elements from `ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[x]` (which is just `ans[x]` since `ans[fa[x]]` was initially empty), and `ans[x]` contains the union of all elements from `ans[fa[x]]`. `nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1; `dep` is decreased by 1.**
