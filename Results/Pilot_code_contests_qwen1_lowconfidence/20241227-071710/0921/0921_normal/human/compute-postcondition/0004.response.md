Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` from the standard input, where `3 ≤ n ≤ 106`, representing the number of men in the Roman army, and returns this integer `n`. There is no explicit parameter passed to the function. The function uses `sys.stdout` to capture output and `os.read` to read the input from the standard input. However, the code provided does not actually read the input from the standard input; instead, it attempts to redirect and manipulate the output stream, which is unnecessary for the intended functionality.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The code does not handle the case where the input is not within the specified range (`3 ≤ n ≤ 106`). This could lead to unexpected behavior if invalid input is provided.
- The function should explicitly read the integer `n` from the standard input, rather than relying on manipulation of output streams.
- The function should also ensure that the input is a valid integer before returning it.
