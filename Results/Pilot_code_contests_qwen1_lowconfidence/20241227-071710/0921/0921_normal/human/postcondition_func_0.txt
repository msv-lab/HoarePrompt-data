The function reads an integer `n` from the standard input, where `3 ≤ n ≤ 106`, representing the number of men in the Roman army, and returns this integer `n`. There is no explicit parameter passed to the function. The function uses `sys.stdout` to capture output and `os.read` to read the input from the standard input. However, the code provided does not actually read the input from the standard input; instead, it attempts to redirect and manipulate the output stream, which is unnecessary for the intended functionality.
