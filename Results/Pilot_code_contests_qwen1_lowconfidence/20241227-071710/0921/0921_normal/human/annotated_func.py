#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 106) representing the number of men in the Roman army. The second line contains n distinct positive integers ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) representing the powers of the men in the Roman army.
def func_1():
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    #The program returns the first integer from the standard input, which is the number of men in the Roman army (3 ≤ n ≤ 106)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` from the standard input, where `3 ≤ n ≤ 106`, representing the number of men in the Roman army, and returns this integer `n`. There is no explicit parameter passed to the function. The function uses `sys.stdout` to capture output and `os.read` to read the input from the standard input. However, the code provided does not actually read the input from the standard input; instead, it attempts to redirect and manipulate the output stream, which is unnecessary for the intended functionality.
