You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Romans have attacked again. This time they are much more than the Persians but Shapur is ready to defeat them. He says: "A lion is never afraid of a hundred sheep". 

Nevertheless Shapur has to find weaknesses in the Roman army to defeat them. So he gives the army a weakness number.

In Shapur's opinion the weakness of an army is equal to the number of triplets i, j, k such that i < j < k and ai > aj > ak where ax is the power of man standing at position x. The Roman army has one special trait — powers of all the people in it are distinct.

Help Shapur find out how weak the Romans are.

Input

The first line of input contains a single number n (3 ≤ n ≤ 106) — the number of men in Roman army. Next line contains n different positive integers ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — powers of men in the Roman army. 

Output

A single integer number, the weakness of the Roman army. 

Please, do not use %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preffered to use cout (also you may use %I64d).

            r >>= 1
        return res

    def update(self, ix, val, col):
        ix += self.n
        self.tree[ix][col] += val
        while ix > 1:
            self.tree[ix >> 1][col] = self.tree[ix][col] + self.tree[ix ^ 1][col]
            ix >>= 1
input = func_1()
(n, a) = (int(input()), [int(x) for x in input().split()])
(tree, ans) = (order_tree(n), 0)
mem = {i: j for (j, i) in enumerate(sorted(a))}
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    cur = mem[a[i]]
    ans += tree.query(cur, 1)
    tree.update(cur, 1, 0)
    tree.update(cur, tree.query(cur, 0), 1)
print(ans)

def func_1():
    import os, sys, atexit
    from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
