You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Romans have attacked again. This time they are much more than the Persians but Shapur is ready to defeat them. He says: "A lion is never afraid of a hundred sheep". 

Nevertheless Shapur has to find weaknesses in the Roman army to defeat them. So he gives the army a weakness number.

In Shapur's opinion the weakness of an army is equal to the number of triplets i, j, k such that i < j < k and ai > aj > ak where ax is the power of man standing at position x. The Roman army has one special trait — powers of all the people in it are distinct.

Help Shapur find out how weak the Romans are.

Input

The first line of input contains a single number n (3 ≤ n ≤ 106) — the number of men in Roman army. Next line contains n different positive integers ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — powers of men in the Roman army. 

Output

A single integer number, the weakness of the Roman army. 

Please, do not use %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preffered to use cout (also you may use %I64d).

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
class order_tree:

    def __init__(self, n):
        (self.tree, self.n) = ([[0, 0] for _ in range(n << 1)], n)

    def query(self, r, col):
        res = 0
        l = self.n
        r += self.n
        while l < r:
            if l & 1:
                res += self.tree[l][col]
                l += 1
            if r & 1:
                r -= 1
                res += self.tree[r][col]
            l >>= 1
            r >>= 1
        return res

    def update(self, ix, val, col):
        ix += self.n
        self.tree[ix][col] += val
        while ix > 1:
            self.tree[ix >> 1][col] = self.tree[ix][col] + self.tree[ix ^ 1][col]
            ix >>= 1
input = func_1()
(n, a) = (int(input()), [int(x) for x in input().split()])
(tree, ans) = (order_tree(n), 0)
mem = {i: j for (j, i) in enumerate(sorted(a))}
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    cur = mem[a[i]]
    ans += tree.query(cur, 1)
    tree.update(cur, 1, 0)
    tree.update(cur, tree.query(cur, 0), 1)
print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 106) representing the number of men in the Roman army. The second line contains n distinct positive integers ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) representing the powers of the men in the Roman army.
def func_1():
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    #The program returns the first integer from the standard input, which is the number of men in the Roman army (3 ≤ n ≤ 106)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
