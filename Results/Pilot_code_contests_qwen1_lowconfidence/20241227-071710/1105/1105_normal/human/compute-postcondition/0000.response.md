The provided code defines a lambda function `rints` which reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and converts each string to an integer, returning a list of these integers. However, this lambda function does not assign or modify any existing variables directly; instead, it provides a method for reading input. Since no variables are modified or assigned within the lambda function itself, the only change is that the `rints` function is now available for use.

Given the initial state where `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500,000\), and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), the `rints` function simply allows for the potential reading of such a list when called. No variables are altered by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500,000\), and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\); `rints` is a lambda function defined to read and split a line of space-separated integers into a list of integers.**
