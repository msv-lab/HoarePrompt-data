`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means it reads an integer from input. The variable `a` is assigned the value of `rints()`, which reads a line of space-separated integers and splits them into a list. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500,000\); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\); `rints` is a lambda function defined to read and split a line of space-separated integers into a list of integers.
