Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500,000\); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\); `rints` is a lambda function defined to read and split a line of space-separated integers into a list of integers; `neg` is the count of negative numbers in `a`; `pos` is the count of non-negative numbers in `a`. The count of negative numbers in `a` is 0**
