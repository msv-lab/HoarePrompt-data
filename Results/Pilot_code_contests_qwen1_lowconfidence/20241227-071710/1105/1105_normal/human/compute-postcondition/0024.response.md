Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500,000\), `a` is a list of integers, and `ans` is the maximum of its current value and the conditions specified. If `i < n - 1` and `a[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and \(a[i] + a[i + 1]\). Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
