Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500,000\), `a` is a list of integers, and `ans` is the maximum of its current value and the following conditions:
- If `i` is 1 and `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, then `ans` is the maximum of its current value and \(s - a[0]\).
- If `i` is 1 and `a[i] >= a[i - 1]`, then `ans` is the maximum of its current value and the following:
  - If `i < n - 1` and `a[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is the maximum of its current value and \(s - a[2]\).
  - Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
