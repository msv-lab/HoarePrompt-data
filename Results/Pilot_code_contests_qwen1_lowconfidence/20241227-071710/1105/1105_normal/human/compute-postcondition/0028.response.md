Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500,000\); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\); `rints` is a lambda function defined to read and split a line of space-separated integers into a list of integers; `neg` is the count of negative numbers in `a`. If `neg` is greater than 0, the absolute values of all elements in `a` are summed up and printed. Otherwise, the maximum value of `s - a[j]` for any `j` where either `a[j] < a[j - 1]` or `a[j] < a[j + 1]` is found and printed.***
