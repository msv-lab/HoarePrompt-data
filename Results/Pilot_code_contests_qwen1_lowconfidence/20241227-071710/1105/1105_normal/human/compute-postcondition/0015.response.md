Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500,000\), `a` is a list of integers, and `ans` is the maximum of its current value and `s - a[i + 1]` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `a[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged and `i`, `n`, and `a` maintain their preconditions.***
