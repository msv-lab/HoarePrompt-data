Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500,000\), and \(a[i] \geq a[i - 1]\). If `i` is less than `n - 1` and `a[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `s - a[i + 1]`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, and `a` remain as per the precondition and `ans` remains unchanged.***
