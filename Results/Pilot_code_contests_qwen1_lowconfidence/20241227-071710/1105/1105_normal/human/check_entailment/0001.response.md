Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where all slimes have positive values. In such a scenario, the program incorrectly calculates the maximum possible value of the last slime.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
1 2 3
```

According to the problem description, the maximum possible value of the last slime should be obtained by having the smallest value (1) eat the largest value (3) first, resulting in a value of -2, and then the remaining slime (2) eats the slime with value -2, resulting in a final value of 4.

However, the provided program sums the absolute values of all slimes, which results in:
```
1 + 2 + 3 = 6
```

This is incorrect because it does not account for the optimal strategy of having smaller values eat larger values to maximize the final value. Therefore, the program fails to handle this case correctly, leading to a wrong output.
