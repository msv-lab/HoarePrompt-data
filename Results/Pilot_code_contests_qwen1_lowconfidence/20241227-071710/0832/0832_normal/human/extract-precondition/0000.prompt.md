You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: You are given a sequence of numbers a1, a2, ..., an, and a number m.

Check if it is possible to choose a non-empty subsequence aij such that the sum of numbers in this subsequence is divisible by m.

Input

The first line contains two numbers, n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 106, 2 ≤ m ≤ 103) — the size of the original sequence and the number such that sum should be divisible by it.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

Output

In the single line print either "YES" (without the quotes) if there exists the sought subsequence, or "NO" (without the quotes), if such subsequence doesn't exist.

Examples

Input

3 5
1 2 3


Output

YES


Input

1 6
5


Output

NO


Input

4 6
3 1 1 3


Output

YES


Input

6 6
5 5 5 5 5 5


Output

YES

Note

In the first sample test you can choose numbers 2 and 3, the sum of which is divisible by 5.

In the second sample test the single non-empty subsequence of numbers is a single number 5. Number 5 is not divisible by 6, that is, the sought subsequence doesn't exist.

In the third sample test you need to choose two numbers 3 on the ends.

In the fourth sample test you can take the whole subsequence.
Program:
```
def func_1(sync=True):
    """

    Parameters

    """
    global input, flush
    if sync:
        flush = sys.stdout.flush
    else:
        sys.stdin = stream(sys.stdin.read())
        input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
        sys.stdout = stream()
        register(lambda : sys.__stdout__.write(sys.stdout.getvalue()))
