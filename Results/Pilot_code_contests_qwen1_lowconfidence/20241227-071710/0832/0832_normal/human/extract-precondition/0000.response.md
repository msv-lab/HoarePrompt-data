Precondition: **sync is a boolean value indicating whether to allow buffering of standard Python streams I/O.** 

However, the provided function `func_1` does not directly relate to the problem described. It seems to manipulate how input and output are handled in terms of buffering. Given the context of the problem, we should focus on the function that checks for a subsequence with a sum divisible by `m`.

Since `func_1` is not relevant to solving the given problem, let's assume there is another function that actually performs the check for the subsequence. Here is what that function might look like and its precondition:

```python
from typing import List

def check_subsequence_divisible_by_m(n: int, m: int, nums: List[int]) -> str:
    """
    Checks if there exists a non-empty subsequence whose sum is divisible by m.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The length of the sequence.
    m (int): The divisor.
    nums (List[int]): The sequence of integers.

    Returns:
    str: "YES" if such a subsequence exists, "NO" otherwise.
    """
    # Implement the logic here
    pass

# Precondition: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, m is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^3, and nums is a list of integers of length n.**
```

This precondition describes the constraints on the input parameters `n`, `m`, and `nums`.
