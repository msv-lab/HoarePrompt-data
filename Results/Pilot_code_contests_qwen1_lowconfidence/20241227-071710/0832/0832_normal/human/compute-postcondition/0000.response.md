The provided code is a docstring and does not perform any actions that would affect the variables. The docstring describes a function or method that sets the synchronization setting for standard Python streams I/O, but it does not actually set the value of `sync`. Therefore, the value of `sync` remains unchanged from its initial state.

Output State: **`sync` is a boolean value indicating whether to allow buffering of standard Python streams I/O.**
