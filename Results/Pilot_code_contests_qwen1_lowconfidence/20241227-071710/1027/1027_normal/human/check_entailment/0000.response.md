Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the number of roads connected to each city. The program iterates through each road, incrementing the count for both cities involved in the road. It then prints the count for each city. Given the constraints and the problem description, this program will work correctly for all potential cases. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program might fail based on the provided code and problem statement.
