Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of cities \( N \) and the number of roads \( M \) from the input using `raw_input().split()`.
   - It initializes a list `count` of length \( N \) with all elements set to 0. This list will keep track of the number of roads connected to each city.

2. **Processing Each Road:**
   - For each road, the program reads the two cities \( a \) and \( b \) connected by the road.
   - Since each road is bidirectional, it increments the count for both cities \( a \) and \( b \). Specifically, it updates `count[a-1]` and `count[b-1]`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all roads, the program prints the count of roads connected to each city. It iterates through the `count` list and prints each value.

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Initialization:** The program correctly initializes the `count` list with zeros, which ensures that no city starts with any roads connected to it.
- **Bidirectional Roads:** By incrementing both `count[a-1]` and `count[b-1]`, the program accounts for both directions of the bidirectional road.
- **Output Format:** The program outputs the count of roads connected to each city in the required format, one count per line.

### Edge Cases Considered:

- The constraints \( 2 \leq N, M \leq 50 \) are respected, and the program will handle these limits without issues.
- The input is assumed to be valid, meaning the program does not need to handle invalid inputs explicitly. The provided input guarantees that \( 1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq N \) and \( a_i \neq b_i \).

Since the program correctly implements the logic as specified in the problem description and handles all valid cases within the given constraints, the program is **correct**.
