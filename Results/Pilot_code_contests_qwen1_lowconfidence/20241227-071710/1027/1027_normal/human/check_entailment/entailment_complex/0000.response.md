Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads two integers \( N \) and \( M \) from user input, which defines the number of cities and roads, respectively.
   - It then processes \( M \) pairs of integers \( (a, b) \) representing the bidirectional roads connecting the cities. Each \( a \) and \( b \) are validated to be within the range \( 1 \leq a, b \leq N \) and \( a \neq b \).

2. **Counting Roads**:
   - For each road \( (a, b) \), the program increments the count of both \( a \) and \( b \) by 1 in a list called `count`. This ensures that each city's count reflects the number of roads connected to it.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all the roads, the program prints the count of roads connected to each city. The counts are outputted one per line, corresponding to cities indexed from 0 to \( N-1 \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The constraints \( 2 \leq N, M \leq 50 \) are respected by the program.
   - The program handles the input validation implicitly through the constraints and the nature of the problem (each \( a \) and \( b \) are unique and within bounds).

Given these points, the program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases within the specified constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
