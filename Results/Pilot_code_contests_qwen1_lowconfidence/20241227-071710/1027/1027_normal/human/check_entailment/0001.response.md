Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly count the number of roads connected to each city. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of cities `n` and roads `m` from the first line of input.
2. It initializes a list `count` with zeros, where each index represents a city and the value at each index will store the number of roads connected to that city.
3. It then iterates over each road, reading the cities `a` and `b` it connects. Since the graph is undirected, both ends of the road are incremented in the `count` list.
4. Finally, it prints the count for each city.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach should handle all valid inputs correctly. There are no obvious edge cases or potential issues in the code that would cause it to fail under any circumstances within the specified constraints.
