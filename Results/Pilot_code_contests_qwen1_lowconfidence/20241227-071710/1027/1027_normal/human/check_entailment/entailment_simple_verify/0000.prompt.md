You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N cities and M roads. The i-th road (1≤i≤M) connects two cities a_i and b_i (1≤a_i,b_i≤N) bidirectionally. There may be more than one road that connects the same pair of two cities. For each city, how many roads are connected to the city?

Constraints

* 2≤N,M≤50
* 1≤a_i,b_i≤N
* a_i ≠ b_i
* All input values are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M
a_1 b_1
:
a_M b_M


Output

Print the answer in N lines. In the i-th line (1≤i≤N), print the number of roads connected to city i.

Program:

def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    count = [0] * n
    for i in xrange(m):
        (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        count[a - 1] += 1
        count[b - 1] += 1
    for i in xrange(n):
        print(count[i])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the number of roads connected to each city. The program iterates through each road, incrementing the count for both cities involved in the road. It then prints the count for each city. Given the constraints and the problem description, this program will work correctly for all potential cases. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program might fail based on the provided code and problem statement.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and M are integers such that 2≤N,M≤50, and a_i and b_i are integers such that 1≤a_i,b_i≤N and a_i ≠ b_i for all 1≤i≤M.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())
    count = [0] * n
    for i in xrange(m):
        a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        count[a - 1] += 1
        
        count[b - 1] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `count` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the count of how many times the corresponding index (plus one) was selected as either `a` or `b` in the input pairs, `i` is `m-1`, `a` is the last `a` input by the user, `b` is the last `b` input by the user.
    for i in xrange(n):
        print(count[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is unspecified, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `count` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the count of how many times the corresponding index (plus one) was selected as either `a` or `b` in the input pairs, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is the last `a` input by the user, `b` is the last `b` input by the user, and `count[i]` is printed.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
