Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the number of cities \( N \) and roads \( M \), then iterates over \( M \) pairs of cities, incrementing the count of roads connected to each city. Finally, it prints the count of roads for each city. The code handles all the given constraints and examples correctly, and there are no apparent edge cases that the code fails to address.
