Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It reads the number of cities \( N \) and roads \( M \), then iterates through each road, incrementing the count of connections for both cities involved in the road. Finally, it prints the count of roads connected to each city.

The program handles all potential cases as described:
- It correctly reads the input constraints \( 2 \leq N, M \leq 50 \).
- It processes each road and updates the counts accurately.
- It prints the number of roads connected to each city in the required format.

Since the program meets the requirements for every potential case and the output hints confirm its correctness, the program is correct.
