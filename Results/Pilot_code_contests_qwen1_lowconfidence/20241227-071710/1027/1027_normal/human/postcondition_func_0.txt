The function reads two integers \( N \) and \( M \) from user input, where \( 2 \leq N, M \leq 50 \). It then processes \( M \) pairs of integers \( (a, b) \) such that \( 1 \leq a, b \leq N \) and \( a \neq b \) for each pair. For each pair, it increments the count of both \( a \) and \( b \) by 1. After processing all pairs, it prints the count of how many times each index (from 0 to \( N-1 \)) was selected as either \( a \) or \( b \). The function does not return any value.
