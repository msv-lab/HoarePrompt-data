Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `total` is unspecified.
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 50.
   - `m` is an integer between 2 and 50.
   - `count` is a list of `n` integers where each element represents the count of how many times the corresponding index (plus one) was selected as either `a` or `b` in the input pairs.
   - `i` is between 0 and `n-1` inclusive.
   - `a` is the last `a` input by the user.
   - `b` is the last `b` input by the user.
   - The value of `count[i]` is printed.

2. **For Loop**: 
   ```python
   for i in xrange(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is between 0 and `n-1` inclusive.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will increment by 1.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since `i` increments by 1 at the start of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `count[i]` is printed at the end of each iteration, so there are no immediate changes to `count` based on the loop itself. However, the condition for the loop to continue is still dependent on `i < n`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was previously `k`, it will now be `k + 1`.
- The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

Since `i` is incremented and `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue, the next state should reflect `i` being incremented by 1.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `i` is between 1 and `n-1` (since `i` is incremented from its previous value, which was between 0 and `n-2`).
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `count` remains unchanged.
- `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`total` is unspecified, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `count` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the count of how many times the corresponding index (plus one) was selected as either `a` or `b` in the input pairs, `i` is between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `a` is the last `a` input by the user, `b` is the last `b` input by the user, and the value of `count[i]` is printed.**
