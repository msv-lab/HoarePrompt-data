The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. The functionality involves internal constraints where two integers `N` and `M` exist such that \(2 \leq N, M \leq 50\), and for each \(1 \leq i \leq M\), there are integers \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) such that \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq N\) and \(a_i \neq b_i\). However, since these constraints are given outside the function definition and do not appear as function parameters, they are not part of the function's parameter list.

Given the output cases are not specified directly in the function definition but rather implied by the constraints, the function's primary responsibility is to handle the internal logic based on these constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and processes integers N and M with specific constraints (2 ≤ N, M ≤ 50) and arrays a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ N, a_i ≠ b_i for all 1 ≤ i ≤ M), returning based on the internal logic defined by these constraints.**
