Functionality: **The function reads two integers \( N \) and \( M \) from user input, where \( 2 \leq N, M \leq 50 \). It then processes \( M \) pairs of integers \( (a, b) \) such that \( 1 \leq a, b \leq N \) and \( a \neq b \) for each pair. For each pair, it increments the count of both \( a \) and \( b \) by 1. After processing all pairs, it prints the count of how many times each index (from 0 to \( N-1 \)) was selected as either \( a \) or \( b \). The function does not return any value.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \( N \) or \( M \) is exactly 2, the function still works as expected.
- If all pairs \( (a, b) \) are the same, the corresponding indices in the `count` list will be incremented multiple times.
- If the input does not meet the specified constraints (i.e., \( N \) or \( M \) is less than 2 or greater than 50), the function will still process the input within the given constraints, and any values outside the range will be ignored.

**Missing Functionality:**
- There is no error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values or values outside the specified range).
- The function does not validate the constraints \( 1 \leq a, b \leq N \) and \( a \neq b \) strictly; it only processes the valid pairs as long as they are within the given range.
