The code `count[b - 1] += 1` increments the value at index `b - 1` in the list `count` by 1. Since `count` is initially a list of `n` zeros with two elements at indices `b - 1` and `a - 1` both incremented by 1, the value at index `b - 1` is already 1. Incrementing this value by 1 changes it to 2. The other parts of the list remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state of the list `count` is that the element at index `b - 1` is now 2, while the element at index `a - 1` remains 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50; `m` is an integer between 2 and 50; `count` is a list of `n` zeros with an element at index `b - 1` equal to 2 and an element at index `a - 1` equal to 1; `i` is 1; `a` is the first integer input by the user; `b` is the second integer input by the user.**
