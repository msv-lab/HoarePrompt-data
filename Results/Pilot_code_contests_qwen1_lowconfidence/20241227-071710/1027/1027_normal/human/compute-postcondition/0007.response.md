The code `a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. It also converts the input strings to integers.

- `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values from the user input.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `count`, `i`, and `a` are updated as a result of this operation.

Here's the updated state:

- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50.
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50.
- `count` is a list of `n` zeros with one element at index `b - 1` incremented by 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `a` is the first integer input by the user.
- `b` is the second integer input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50; `m` is an integer between 2 and 50; `count` is a list of `n` zeros with one element at index `b - 1` incremented by 1; `i` is 1; `a` is the first integer input by the user; `b` is the second integer input by the user.**
