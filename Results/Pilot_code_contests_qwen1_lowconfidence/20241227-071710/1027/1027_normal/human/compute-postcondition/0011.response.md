The code `a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. Since the original values of `a` and `b` were defined as the first and second integer inputs by the user, these values will be updated with the new inputs.

The initial values of `n`, `m`, `count`, `i` remain unchanged as the code does not affect these variables. The updated values for `a` and `b` are the integers provided by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50; `m` is an integer between 2 and 50; `count` is a list of `n` zeros with an element at index `b - 1` equal to 2 and an element at index `a - 1` equal to 1; `i` is 2; `a` is the first integer input by the user; `b` is the second integer input by the user.**
