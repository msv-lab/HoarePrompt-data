The code `print(count[i])` simply prints the value of `count[i]`. This does not change any variable's value but outputs the value of `count[i]`.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `count` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the count of how many times the corresponding index (plus one) was selected as either `a` or `b` in the input pairs, `i` is between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `a` is the last `a` input by the user, `b` is the last `b` input by the user, and the value of `count[i]` is printed.**
