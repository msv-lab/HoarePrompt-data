The code reads two integers from input using `raw_input().split()` and assigns them to `n` and `m`. Since the initial values of `n` and `m` are given in the range 2 to 50, and the other conditions (like `a_i` and `b_i`) are not affected by this input, those conditions remain valid. After reading the input, `n` and `m` are assigned the specific values entered by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, and 2≤N,M≤50, and a_i and b_i are integers such that 1≤a_i,b_i≤N and a_i ≠ b_i for all 1≤i≤M.**
