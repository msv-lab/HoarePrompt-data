Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `count` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the count of how many times the corresponding index (plus one) was selected as either `a` or `b` in the input pairs, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is the last `a` input by the user, `b` is the last `b` input by the user, and `count[i]` is printed.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution Analysis:**
   - The loop runs for `n` iterations.
   - Each iteration prints the value of `count[i]`.
   - After `n` iterations, `i` will be `n-1`.

2. **Final Values of Variables:**
   - Since the loop runs `n` times, `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes.
   - The values of `n`, `m`, `count`, `a`, and `b` do not change within the loop itself, they retain their initial values or last updated values based on the inputs.
   - The `count` list will have its elements updated based on the selection of `a` and `b` during the input process, but the specific final values of `count[i]` for each `i` depend on the sequence of selections made by the user.

3. **Summary of Output State:**
   - The loop will always execute `n` times.
   - After all iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1`.
   - The `count` list will contain counts for each index up to `n-1`.
   - `a` and `b` will retain their last updated values based on user inputs.
   - The `total` remains unspecified as it is not directly affected by the loop.

Thus, the final output state after the loop completes all iterations is as described above.
