The input consists of two integers n and m, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 3·10⁵ and 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n·(n - 1), 3·10⁵). Following these, m lines each contain three space-separated integers ui, vi, and wi, representing a directed edge from vertex ui to vertex vi with weight wi, where 1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 10⁵. There are no self-loops or multiple edges in the graph.
