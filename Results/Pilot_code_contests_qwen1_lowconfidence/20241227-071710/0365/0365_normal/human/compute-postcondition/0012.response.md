The code `all = [(v, mem[u]) for u, v in weight[i]]` is a list comprehension that creates a new list `all` based on the contents of `weight[i]`. However, since `weight` is not defined in the initial state and no values are explicitly provided for `mem`, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in the list `all`. We can only state that `all` is a list of tuples, each containing elements from `weight[i]`.

The initial state is that `i` is 1. After executing the code, the value of `i` remains unchanged, but `all` is now a list generated from `weight[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `all` is a list of tuples generated from `weight[1]`**
