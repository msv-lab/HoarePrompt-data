To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given and follow the logic step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `i` is 100000
  - `all` has at least one tuple
  - For each tuple `(v, du)` in `all`, `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`

### Loop Statement:
```
for (v, du) in all:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Iteration Count:**
   - The variable `i` was set to 100000 at some point before the loop started. This likely indicates an initialization or an outer condition that doesn't directly impact the inner loop itself.
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `(v, du)` in the list `all`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop updates `mem[v]` to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` in `all`.
   - After processing all tuples in `all`, the loop will terminate if `all` is empty or if no further iterations are required based on the loop condition.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are tuples in `all`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `all` must have at least one tuple.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is already at 100000 and it does not influence the continuation of the loop, we do not need to adjust it.
   - We need to ensure that `all` still has at least one tuple for the loop to continue.

### Conclusion:
The state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is ensuring that `all` has at least one tuple.

**State:**
- `i` is 100000
- `all` must have at least one tuple

Therefore, the final answer is:
**State: **`i` is 100000, `all` must have at least one tuple**.
