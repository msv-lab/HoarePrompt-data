The code snippet appends the tuple `(u, v)` to the list `weight[w]` for each edge specified in the `edges` list. Since the `edges` list is not provided with specific values, we can only describe the general impact on the `weight` list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer
- `m` is greater than 0
- `edges` is a 2D list with at least `m - 1` rows
- `mem` is a list of `n + 1` zeros
- `weight` is a list of 100001 empty lists, and for each `w` in the `edges` list, the list `weight[w]` contains additional tuples `(u, v)`

After executing the code:
- Each tuple `(u, v)` from the `edges` list will be appended to the corresponding list in `weight` at the index `w`.

Since the exact values of `u`, `v`, and `w` are not specified, we can only say that the `weight` list will contain these tuples.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `edges` is a 2D list with at least `m - 1` rows, `mem` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `weight` is a list of 100001 empty lists where for each `w` in the `edges` list, the list `weight[w]` now contains the additional tuple `(u, v)` for each edge specified in the `edges` list.**
