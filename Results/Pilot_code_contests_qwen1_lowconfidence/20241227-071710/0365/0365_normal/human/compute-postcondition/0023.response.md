The code updates the value of `mem[v]` to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`. However, the initial values of `mem`, `v`, and `du` are not specified. Since `v` and `du` are initialized within the loop for each tuple in `all`, their initial values are not known. The only known information is that `i` is 100000 and `all` must have at least one tuple.

Given this, the updated value of `mem[v]` for each tuple `(v, du)` encountered in the loop will be `max(mem[v], du + 1)`. Since the initial values of `v` and `du` are not provided, we cannot specify the exact values of `mem[v]`, but we know they will be updated according to the given formula.

The output state will reflect that `i` remains unchanged at 100000, `all` remains having at least one tuple, and `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` in `all`.

Output State: **`i` is 100000, `all` has at least one tuple, `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` in `all`.**
