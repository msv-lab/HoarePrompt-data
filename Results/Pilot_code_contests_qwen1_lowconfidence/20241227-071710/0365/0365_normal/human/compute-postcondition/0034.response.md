The code updates `mem[v]` to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`. Since the exact values of `v` and `du` are not specified in the initial state, we can only state that `mem[v]` is now the maximum of its original value and `du + 1`. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`, `v` and `du` are the next values from the `all` collection**
