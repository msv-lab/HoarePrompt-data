The given code snippet updates the value of `mem[v]` to be the maximum between its current value and `du + 1`. However, since no initial values for `mem`, `v`, or `du` are provided, we can only describe the operation in a general sense.

The code updates the dictionary `mem` such that the value associated with key `v` is set to the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`. Since the initial values are not specified, we cannot provide specific numerical values for the updated state.

Output State: **`mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`**
