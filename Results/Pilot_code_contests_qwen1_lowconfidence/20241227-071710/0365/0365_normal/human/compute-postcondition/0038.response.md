Output State: **`i` is 100001, `all` is an empty list, `mem[v]` is the maximum value of `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` in `all` for all `v` in `mem`.**

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `m` is a non-negative integer.
   - `edges` is a 2D list with `m` rows where each row is a tuple of three integers.
   - `mem` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
   - `weight` is a list of 100001 empty lists, where for each `w` in the `edges` list, the list `weight[w]` contains tuples `(u, v)` for each edge specified in the `edges` list.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The outer loop runs from `1` to `10^5 + 1`.
   - For each iteration `i`:
     - `all` is a list comprehension that creates a list of tuples `(v, mem[u])` for each edge `(u, v)` in `weight[i]`.
     - The inner loop iterates over each tuple in `all` and updates `mem[v]` to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`, where `(v, du)` is a tuple in `all`.

3. **Behavior After Multiple Iterations**:
   - The loop will continue to iterate until `i` reaches `100001`.
   - During each iteration, the `all` list is populated based on the current `i` value.
   - As `i` increases, the `all` list will eventually become empty because the structure of `weight[i]` will no longer contain any edges (since the edges are defined only within the bounds of the given `edges` list).

4. **Final State After All Iterations**:
   - By the time `i` reaches `100001`, `all` will be an empty list.
   - `mem[v]` will be updated to the maximum value of `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` encountered during all previous iterations of the loop.
   - This means `mem[v]` will store the maximum distance (in terms of `du + 1`) from node `v` to any reachable node in the graph defined by the `edges`.

5. **No Execution Case**:
   - If the loop does not execute (which would happen if there are no edges in the graph), `i` remains `0`, `all` is always empty, and `mem[v]` remains `0` for all `v`.

### Conclusion:
The final state after the loop completes all iterations is that `i` is `100001`, `all` is an empty list, and `mem[v]` contains the maximum value of `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` in `all` for all `v` in `mem`.
