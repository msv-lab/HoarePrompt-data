Functionality: **The function reads a directed graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges, where each edge is defined by a pair of vertices `(u, v)` and a positive integer weight `w`. It then computes the maximum distance from vertex 1 to every other vertex in the graph using a modified breadth-first search approach. The function stores these distances in the `mem` array and finally returns the maximum distance found. If the graph is disconnected or contains isolated vertices, the function still processes them according to the given rules. However, note that the function does not handle negative weights or self-loops explicitly, as per the problem statement.**
