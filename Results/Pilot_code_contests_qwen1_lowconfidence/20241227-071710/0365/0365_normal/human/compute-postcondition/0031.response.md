Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `(v, du)` in the list `all`.
   - The loop variable is `(v, du)`.

2. **Determine if the Loop Can Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, the list `all` must contain at least one tuple.
   - The initial state of `i` and `mem[v]` does not directly affect the loop execution but should be consistent with the given constraints.

3. **Initial State Provided:**
   - `i` is 100001.
   - `all` is a list of tuples created from `weight[i]`.
   - `mem[v]` is the maximum value of `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` in `all` for all `v` in `mem`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop depends on `all` containing at least one tuple, we need to ensure `all` has at least one element.
   - The value of `i` (100001) is not directly relevant to the loop execution unless it affects the creation of `all`, but since no such relationship is explicitly mentioned, we assume it remains unchanged.
   - The state of `mem[v]` is already defined and does not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the key state to adjust is the list `all` having at least one tuple.

**State:**
- **`i` is 100001, `all` must have at least one tuple, `mem[v]` is the maximum value of `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` in `all` for all `v` in `mem`**.
