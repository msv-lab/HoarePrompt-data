To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop itself.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer.
- `m` is a non-negative integer.
- `edges` is a 2D list with `m` rows, where each row is a tuple of three integers.
- `mem` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `weight` is a list of 100001 empty lists, where for each `w` in the `edges` list, the list `weight[w]` contains tuples `(u, v)` for each edge specified in the `edges` list.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(1, 10 ** 5 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop runs from `1` to `10^5`, inclusive. This means the loop will run `100000` times (from `i = 1` to `i = 100000`).

### Necessary Adjustments:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments by 1 until `i = 100000`.
   - Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to `1`.

2. **No direct dependency on `n`, `m`, `edges`, `mem`, or `weight`:**
   - These variables are not directly used within the loop condition (`i in range(1, 10 ** 5 + 1)`).
   - However, these variables might be modified or used inside the loop body, but based on the provided information, they don't affect the loop execution directly.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop's condition only depends on `i` and it must start from `1`, we need to adjust the initial state to ensure `i` is `1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1**
