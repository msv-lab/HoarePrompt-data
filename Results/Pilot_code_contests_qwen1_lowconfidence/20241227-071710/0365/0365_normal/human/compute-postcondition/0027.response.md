The code updates the value in the `mem` dictionary at key `v` to be the maximum between the current value and `du + 1`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact structure of `mem` or the value of `v`, and only states that `mem` contains at least one tuple, we can infer that `v` is a key in `mem` and `du` is a variable whose value is not specified. However, the code execution does not change the value of `i`, and it does not provide a specific value for `du`. Therefore, the updated value of `mem[v]` is `max(mem[v], du + 1)`.

Output State: **`i` is 100001, `mem[v]` is updated to `max(mem[v], du + 1)`**
