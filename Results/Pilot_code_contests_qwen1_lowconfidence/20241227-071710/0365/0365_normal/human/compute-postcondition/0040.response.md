The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it processes input that consists of two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `m` lines, each containing three integers `ui`, `vi`, and `wi`. The graph does not contain self-loops or multiple edges, and the weights are positive integers not exceeding \(10^5\). Based on the input, the function returns information about the graph, but since the specific output is not detailed, we can only state the input structure.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process an input consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `m` lines of three integers each (`ui`, `vi`, `wi`), and return information about the graph based on this input.
