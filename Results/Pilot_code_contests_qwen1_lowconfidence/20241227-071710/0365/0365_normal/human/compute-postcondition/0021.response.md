The code `all = [(v, mem[u]) for u, v in weight[i]]` updates the list `all`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The variable `weight` is indexed by `i`, which means `weight[100000]` is accessed.
2. This access should yield a list of tuples, each containing two elements: `u` and `v`.
3. For each tuple `(u, v)` in `weight[100000]`, a new tuple `(v, mem[u])` is created and added to the list `all`.

Since `weight[100000]` is a list of tuples, let's denote the list of tuples as `[(u1, v1), (u2, v2), ..., (un, vn)]` for some integer `n`.

After the list comprehension, the list `all` will contain the following elements: `[(v1, mem[u1]), (v2, mem[u2]), ..., (vn, mem[un])]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `i` remains 100000.
- `all` is now a list of tuples, where each tuple is of the form `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i]`.
- `mem` and `v` and `du` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 100000; `all` is a list of tuples, each tuple is `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[100000]; `mem` contains the maximum values for each key based on the loop iterations; `v` is the first element of the tuple in `all`; `du` is the second element of the tuple in `all`.**
