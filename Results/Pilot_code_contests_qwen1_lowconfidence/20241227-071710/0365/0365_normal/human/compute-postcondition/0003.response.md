Let's analyze the code step by step:

- `mem, edges, weight = [0] * (n + 1), rints_2d(m), [[] for _ in range(10 ** 5 + 1)]`

This line of code does the following:
1. `mem` is assigned a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. So, `mem` is a list of `n + 1` elements, each initialized to 0.
2. `edges` is assigned the result of a function call `rints_2d(m)`. Since the exact nature of this function is not specified, we will keep it as `rints_2d(m)`.
3. `weight` is assigned a list of lists. It contains 100001 empty lists.

Given the initial state where `n` is an integer and `m` is an integer, the changes are as follows:
- `n` remains an integer.
- `m` remains an integer.
- `mem` is now a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `edges` is now the result of `rints_2d(m)`.
- `weight` is now a list of 100001 empty lists.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `mem` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `edges` is `rints_2d(m)`, `weight` is a list of 100001 empty lists**
