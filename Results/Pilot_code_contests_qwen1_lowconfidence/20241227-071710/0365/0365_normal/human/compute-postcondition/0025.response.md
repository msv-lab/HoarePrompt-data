The code snippet `mem[v] = max(mem[v], du + 1)` updates the value of `mem[v]` to be the maximum between its current value and `du + 1`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `v` and `du`, only that `mem` must contain at least one tuple. Given this, we cannot determine the exact new value of `mem[v]` without knowing `v` and `du`.

Therefore, the Output State remains: `i` is 100000; `mem` contains at least one tuple, with `mem[v]` updated to be the maximum between its current value and `du + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is 100000; `mem` contains at least one tuple, with `mem[v]` updated to be the maximum between its current value and `du + 1`**
