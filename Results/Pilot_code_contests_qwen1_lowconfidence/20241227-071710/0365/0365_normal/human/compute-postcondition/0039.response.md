The code `print(max(mem))` does not affect any variables or lists directly. It simply retrieves the maximum value from the dictionary `mem` and prints it. Since `mem[v]` is defined as the maximum value of `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` in `all`, and `all` is an empty list, there are no entries in `mem`. Therefore, `max(mem)` will be `None` because an empty dictionary does not contain any keys.

Output State: **`i` is 100001, `all` is an empty list, `mem[v]` is None for all v in `mem`, and print(None)**
