The given code defines a lambda function `rints_2d` which reads a list of lists of integers, each inner list having a length of `n`. This function does not affect the existing values of `n` or `m`, but it sets up a way to read subsequent inputs into a 2D list structure. Given the initial state where the input consists of two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `m` lines each containing three integers `ui`, `vi`, and `wi`, the code does not modify these values directly.

The `rints_2d` function itself does not execute the reading of inputs; it only defines the structure for doing so. Therefore, after defining this function, the state remains unchanged in terms of the actual values of `n`, `m`, and the subsequent inputs, but the system now knows how to read them into a 2D list format.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, and the function `rints_2d` is defined to read a 2D list of size `m x 3` containing integers.**
