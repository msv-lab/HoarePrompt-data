The code `n, m = rints()` assigns the values returned by the function `rints_2d` to the variables `n` and `m`. Since `rints_2d` is defined to read a 2D list of size `m x 3` containing integers, `n` and `m` will hold integer values. However, the exact values of `n` and `m` are not specified in the initial state, so we can only state that `n` and `m` are integers returned from the function.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer**
