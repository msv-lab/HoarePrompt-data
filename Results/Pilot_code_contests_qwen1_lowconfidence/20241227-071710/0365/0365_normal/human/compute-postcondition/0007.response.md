The code snippet `weight[w].append((u, v))` appends a new tuple \((u, v)\) to the list `weight[w]`. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `m` is greater than 0.
   - `edges` is a 2D list with `m` rows, where each row is a tuple of three integers.
   - `mem` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
   - `weight` is a list of 100001 empty lists, where for each `w` in the `edges` list, the list `weight[w]` contains additional tuples `(u, v)`.

2. **Current State Before Code Execution**:
   - A specific tuple \((u, v, w)\) from the `edges` list was processed in the previous iteration.

3. **Effect of the Code**:
   - The line `weight[w].append((u, v))` appends the tuple \((u, v)\) to the list `weight[w]`.

4. **Updated States**:
   - The list `weight[w]` now contains the tuple \((u, v)\).
   - All other states (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `mem`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state after the code execution is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `edges` is a 2D list with `m` rows where each row is a tuple of three integers, `mem` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `weight` is a list of 100001 empty lists, where for each `w` in the `edges` list, the list `weight[w]` contains additional tuples `(u, v)` including the newly added tuple \((u, v)\).**
