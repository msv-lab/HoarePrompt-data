The given code snippet attempts to assign a value to `mem[v]`, but there are several issues:
1. `mem` is not defined in the initial state.
2. `v` is not defined in the initial state.
3. `du` is not defined in the initial state.

Given the incomplete nature of the code and the lack of definitions for `mem`, `v`, and `du`, we cannot determine the exact impact on the variables. However, we can state that the code tries to update `mem[v]` with the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`.

Since the code does not execute due to the missing definitions, the only thing we can infer is that the structure of the precondition remains intact.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `all` is a non-empty list of tuples, `mem` is not defined, `v` is not defined, `du` is not defined**
