According to the given for loop statement, the loop iterates from `1` to `10^5` (inclusive). The loop condition is that `i` must be within this range. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:

- `i` is greater than 0
- `all` is a non-empty list of tuples
- `mem` contains the maximum values for each key based on the loop iterations
- `v` is the first element of the tuple in `all`
- `du` is the second element of the tuple in `all`

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if the current value of `i` is less than `10^5`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is greater than 0. Therefore, `i` is currently somewhere between 1 and \(10^5\). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and should still be within the range [1, \(10^5\)]. 

If `i` was just incremented from \(10^5 - 1\) to \(10^5\), the loop would stop executing because `i` would no longer be within the specified range.

Given that `i` is greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, let's consider the next possible state:

- `i` will be incremented by 1, making it equal to the previous value of `i` plus 1.
- `all` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- `mem` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- `v` and `du` remain the same as they are not modified within the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than \(10^5\).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`i` is 100000, `all` is a non-empty list of tuples, `mem` contains the maximum values for each key based on the loop iterations, `v` is the first element of the tuple in `all`, `du` is the second element of the tuple in `all`**.

However, since the loop will stop at `i == 100000`, the correct state for the next iteration should reflect that the loop cannot continue anymore.

State: **`i` is 100000, `all` is a non-empty list of tuples, `mem` contains the maximum values for each key based on the loop iterations, `v` is the first element of the tuple in `all`, `du` is the second element of the tuple in `all`**.
