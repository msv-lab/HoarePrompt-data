The code `mem[v] = max(mem[v], du + 1)` tries to assign a value to `mem[v]`, but there are issues with the variables involved:

- `mem` is not defined.
- `v` is not defined.

Since neither `mem` nor `v` are defined, the code cannot execute and no changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `all` is a non-empty list of tuples, `mem` is not defined, `v` is not defined, `du` is not defined**
