The given code is a lambda function named `rints` that reads a line from standard input and splits it into integers. This function does not assign any values to existing variables but rather defines a new function that can be used later to read inputs. Therefore, the variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the input process is just described by the function.

Output State: **The input consists of two integers n and m, followed by m lines, each containing three integers ui, vi, and wi, indicating a directed edge from vertex ui to vertex vi with weight wi. The graph does not contain self-loops or multiple edges, and the weights are positive integers not exceeding 10^5; a function `rints` is defined to read inputs as a list of integers.**
