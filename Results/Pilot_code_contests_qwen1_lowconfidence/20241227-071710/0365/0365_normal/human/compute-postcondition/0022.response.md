To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to run.

### Given Information:
- `i` is initially 100000.
- `all` is a list of tuples, where each tuple is `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[100000]`.
- `mem` contains the maximum values for each key based on the loop iterations.
- `v` is the first element of the tuple in `all`.
- `du` is the second element of the tuple in `all`.

### Loop Structure:
```
for (v, du) in all:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - The loop is iterating over the list `all`, which means `all` must contain at least one tuple for the loop to execute.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is determined by the length of the list `all`.
   - For the loop to execute, `all` must not be an empty list.

3. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - `all` must have at least one tuple.
   - `v` and `du` are derived from the tuples in `all`, but they don't need to be explicitly set since the loop will initialize them for each iteration.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- Ensure `all` is not empty.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 100000, `all` must have at least one tuple, `v` and `du` will be initialized by the loop for each tuple in `all`**.

This ensures that the loop can execute because `all` must contain at least one tuple to start the iteration process.
