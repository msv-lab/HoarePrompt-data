To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues to execute. The loop iterates over each tuple \((u, v, w)\) in the `edges` list. 

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `m` is greater than 0.
   - `edges` is a 2D list with `m` rows, where each row is a tuple of three integers.
   - `mem` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
   - `weight` is a list of 100001 empty lists, where for each `w` in the `edges` list, the list `weight[w]` contains additional tuples `(u, v)`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each tuple \((u, v, w)\) in the `edges` list. This means the loop continues as long as there are tuples left in the `edges` list to process.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, a specific tuple \((u, v, w)\) from the `edges` list was processed.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple \((u', v', w')\) must be from the `edges` list.
   - Since the `edges` list is being iterated over, the `edges` list itself does not change; it still contains all the tuples.
   - The only state that changes is the current tuple being processed, which moves to the next tuple in the list.

5. **Adjusted States**:
   - The value of `u`, `v`, and `w` will change to the next tuple in the `edges` list.
   - The rest of the states (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `mem`, `weight`) remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `edges` is a 2D list with `m` rows where each row is a tuple of three integers, `mem` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `weight` is a list of 100001 empty lists, where for each `w` in the `edges` list, the list `weight[w]` contains additional tuples `(u, v)`, and the current tuple \((u, v, w)\) is the next tuple in the `edges` list.**
