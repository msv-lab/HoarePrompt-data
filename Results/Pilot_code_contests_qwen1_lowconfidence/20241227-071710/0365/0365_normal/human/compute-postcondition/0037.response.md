Output State: **`mem[v]` is the maximum value of `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` in `all` for all `v` in `mem`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `mem[v]` is set to the maximum value of `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` in `all` for all `v` in `mem`.
- As the loop iterates through each tuple `(v, du)` in `all`, it updates `mem[v]` to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`.
- After the loop completes, for every `v` that appears in `mem`, `mem[v]` will be the maximum value of `du + 1` for all tuples `(v, du)` in `all`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `all` is an empty list), then `mem[v]` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is the maximum value of `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` in `all` for all `v` in `mem`.
