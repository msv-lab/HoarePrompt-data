The code `mem[v] = max(mem[v], du + 1)` tries to assign a value to `mem[v]`. However, the variables `mem`, `v`, and `du` are not defined in the initial state. Since these variables are not defined, the code will raise a NameError when executed. Therefore, the variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `all` is a non-empty list of tuples, `mem` is not defined, `v` is not defined, `du` is not defined**
