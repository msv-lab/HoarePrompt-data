According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the availability of tuples in `all`. The loop iterates over each tuple `(v, du)` in `all`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 100000, and `mem` contains at least one tuple where `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and `du + 1`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider:

1. **Check if there are more tuples in `all`:** Since `all` is the iterable being used in the for loop, the loop will continue as long as there are more tuples to process. After the last iteration, `i` is 100000, and we know `all` contains at least one tuple.

2. **Update the state for the next iteration:** For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple `(v, du)` from `all` must be processed. This means that `i` will increment, but the exact value of `i` after the next iteration cannot be determined without knowing the structure of `all`. However, we can say that `i` will increase by 1, making it 100001.

3. **Ensure `mem` continues to contain at least one tuple:** Since the loop updates `mem` based on the current tuple, and we know `mem` contained at least one tuple before, it will still contain at least one tuple after the next iteration unless the tuple `(v, du)` is such that it removes the only existing tuple from `mem`. However, without further information about the structure of `all` or the specific updates to `mem`, we can only assume that `mem` will still contain at least one tuple.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 100001, `mem` contains at least one tuple**
