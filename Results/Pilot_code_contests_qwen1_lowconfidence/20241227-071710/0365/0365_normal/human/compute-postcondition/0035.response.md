To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the changes made within the loop and the conditions under which the loop continues.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`.
   - `v` and `du` are the next values from the `all` collection.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over pairs `(v, du)` from the `all` collection.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are more pairs in the `all` collection.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - After the previous iteration, `mem[v]` has been updated with the maximum value.
   - `v` and `du` are the next values from the `all` collection.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next pair `(v, du)` must be taken from the `all` collection.
   - Therefore, `v` and `du` will be the next values from the `all` collection in the next iteration.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `mem[v]` is already updated with the maximum value.
   - The next pair `(v, du)` will be the starting point for the next iteration.

### Conclusion:
The state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is that `mem[v]` remains unchanged from the previous iteration, and `v` and `du` are the next values from the `all` collection.

### Final Answer:
State: **`mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`, `v` and `du` are the next values from the `all` collection**
