Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `all` is a non-empty list of tuples, `mem` contains the maximum values for each key based on the loop iterations, `v` is the first element of the tuple in `all`, `du` is the second element of the tuple in `all`.** 

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Values and Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the list `all`, which is initially a non-empty list of tuples `(v, du)`.
   - The variable `i` starts at 1 and increments with each iteration, but its final value depends on how many times the loop runs.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each tuple `(v, du)` in `all`, the loop updates `mem[v]` to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`.
   - This means `mem` will store the maximum values of `du + 1` for each key `v` encountered in the tuples of `all`.

3. **Final Values:**
   - After all iterations, `i` will be the number of times the loop executed plus 1 (since `i` starts at 1).
   - `all` remains unchanged as it is only used as input to the loop and not modified within it.
   - `mem` will contain the updated maximum values for each `v` based on the loop iterations.
   - `v` and `du` are not defined outside the loop context, so they do not have specific final values. They are used within the loop context to perform the updates.

4. **Case When the Loop Does Not Execute:**
   - If `all` is an empty list, the loop will not execute at all. In this case, `i` will still be 1, `all` will be an empty list, `mem` will be undefined (or possibly initialized but not updated), and `v` and `du` will not be defined.
