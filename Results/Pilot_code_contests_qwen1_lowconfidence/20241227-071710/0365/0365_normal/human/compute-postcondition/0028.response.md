Output State: **`i` is 100001, `all` is an empty list, `mem[v]` is the maximum value of `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` in `all` for all `v` in `mem`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 100000.
   - `all` is a list of tuples, each containing `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[100000]`.
   - `mem` contains the maximum values for each key based on the loop iterations.
   - `v` is the first element of the tuple in `all`.
   - `du` is the second element of the tuple in `all`.

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```python
   for v, du in all:
       mem[v] = max(mem[v], du + 1)
   ```

3. **Output State Analysis**:
   - After the loop iterates through all the tuples in `all`, the value of `mem[v]` for each `v` will be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` in `all`.
   - The loop will continue to execute until there are no more tuples in `all`. Once `all` becomes an empty list, the loop will terminate.
   - Since `i` starts at 100000 and increments by 1 each time a tuple is processed (as implied by the output states), when `all` becomes empty, `i` will be incremented to 100001.
   - Therefore, the final state of `mem[v]` will be the maximum value of `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` in `all` for all `v` in `mem`.

4. **Final Output State**:
   - `i` is 100001.
   - `all` is an empty list.
   - `mem[v]` is the maximum value of `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` in `all` for all `v` in `mem`.
