Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Structure**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(u, v, w)` in the `edges` list.
   - `edges` is defined as `ints_2d(m)`, which means `edges` is a 2D list with `m` rows, where each row contains three integers (representing `u`, `v`, and `w`).

2. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `m` is an integer.
   - `mem` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
   - `edges` is a 2D list of `m` rows, each containing three integers.
   - `weight` is a list of 100001 empty lists.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `edges` must contain at least one element (i.e., `m` must be greater than 0).
   - The elements within `edges` must be valid tuples containing exactly three integers each.

4. **States to Adjust**:
   - Since the loop depends on the presence and structure of the `edges` list, we need to ensure that `edges` is a non-empty 2D list.
   - We also need to confirm that each element in `edges` is a valid tuple of three integers.

### Final State Adjustment:

Based on the analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- Each element in `edges` must be a valid tuple of three integers.

So, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `edges` is a 2D list with `m` rows where each row is a tuple of three integers, `mem` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `weight` is a list of 100001 empty lists**
