The code `all = [(v, mem[u]) for u, v in weight[i]]` creates a new list `all` based on the values in `weight[i]`. Since the initial state does not provide any specific values for `weight`, we need to determine the structure and content of `all` based on the given information.

Given:
- `i` is 100001.
- `all` is initially an empty list.
- `mem[v]` is defined as the maximum value of `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` in `all` for all `v` in `mem`.

The new `all` is defined as a list comprehension using `weight[i]`. However, since `weight` is not explicitly defined in the initial state and no specific values for `weight[i]` are provided, we cannot determine the exact content of `all` without more information.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 100001.
- `all` is now a list of tuples created from `weight[i]`.
- `mem[v]` remains unchanged for now, as the new `all` has not yet been used to update `mem`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 100001; `all` is a list of tuples created from `weight[i]`; `mem[v]` is the maximum value of `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` in `all` for all `v` in `mem` (unchanged)**.
