The code snippet `weight[w].append((u, v))` appends a tuple `(u, v)` to the list `weight[w]`. Here, `w`, `u`, and `v` are not explicitly defined in the provided context, but they are assumed to be derived from the `edges` list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer
- `m` is greater than 0
- `edges` is a 2D list with `m` rows where each row is a tuple of three integers
- `mem` is a list of `n + 1` zeros
- `weight` is a list of 100001 empty lists

For each row in `edges`, which is a tuple `(w, u, v)`, the line `weight[w].append((u, v))` will append the tuple `(u, v)` to the list `weight[w]`.

Since the exact values of `w`, `u`, and `v` are not specified, we cannot provide specific values for the updated `weight` list. However, we know that each `w` (which comes from the `edges` list) will have its corresponding list in `weight` extended by the tuple `(u, v)`.

Therefore, the updated state will be:
- `n` remains an integer
- `m` remains greater than 0
- `edges` remains the same
- `mem` remains a list of `n + 1` zeros
- `weight` will have each `w` from the `edges` list appended with a tuple `(u, v)`

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `edges` is a 2D list with `m` rows where each row is a tuple of three integers, `mem` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `weight` is a list of 100001 empty lists, where for each `w` in the `edges` list, the list `weight[w]` contains additional tuples `(u, v)`**
