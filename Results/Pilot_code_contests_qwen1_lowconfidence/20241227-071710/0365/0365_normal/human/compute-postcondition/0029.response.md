Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 100001
- `all` is an empty list
- `mem[v]` is the maximum value of `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` in `all` for all `v` in `mem`

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(1, 10 ** 5 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `100000` (inclusive) because the range function generates values from the start (1) up to but not including the stop (100001).
2. **Current State**: Since `i` is currently 100001, the loop will terminate after the current iteration as `i` exceeds the upper limit of the range.
3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is about to terminate, there are no new values for `i` to consider.
   - The list `all` remains empty as no new elements were added in the loop.
   - The state of `mem[v]` remains unchanged as no new tuples were processed.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop is about to terminate and no new values are added or updated in the next iteration, the states remain the same.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 100001, `all` is an empty list, `mem[v]` is the maximum value of `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` in `all` for all `v` in `mem`**.
