Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the solution for the described problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of vertices \( n \) and edges \( m \).
   - It then reads \( m \) lines, each containing three integers \( u \), \( v \), and \( w \), representing a directed edge from vertex \( u \) to vertex \( v \) with weight \( w \).

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is represented using an adjacency list structure where `weight` is a list of lists. Each sublist corresponds to edges with the same weight.
   - For each edge \((u, v, w)\), the program appends \((u, v)\) to the list `weight[w]`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program uses dynamic programming to find the longest path with increasing edge weights.
   - `mem` is an array where `mem[v]` represents the maximum number of edges in a path ending at vertex \( v \).
   - For each weight \( w \) from 1 to 100000, the program computes the maximum path length ending at each vertex \( v \) reachable via an edge with weight \( w \).

4. **Path Calculation**:
   - For each weight \( w \), the program iterates over all edges with that weight and updates the `mem` array accordingly.
   - Specifically, for each edge \((u, v)\) with weight \( w \), it updates `mem[v]` to be the maximum of its current value and \( mem[u] + 1 \).

5. **Result Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the maximum value in the `mem` array, which represents the maximum number of edges in a path with increasing weights.

### Compliance with Problem Description:

- The program correctly handles the constraints: \( 2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5 \) and \( 1 \leq m \leq \min(n(n-1), 3 \times 10^5) \).
- The program ensures that no self-loops or multiple edges are present as per the problem statement.
- The program processes all input edges and constructs the `weight` list correctly.
- The dynamic programming approach ensures that the path with the maximum number of edges with strictly increasing weights is found.
- The output is the number of edges in the longest path with increasing weights, which matches the problem requirements.

Since the program adheres to the problem description and logic, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
