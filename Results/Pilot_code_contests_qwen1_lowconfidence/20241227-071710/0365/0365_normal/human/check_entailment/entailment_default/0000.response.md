Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding a path with the maximum number of edges such that the weights of the edges strictly increase along the path. However, the code performs a modified breadth-first search (BFS) to find the maximum distance from vertex 1 to every other vertex, which does not guarantee that the path's edge weights are strictly increasing.

For instance, consider the following graph:

```
3 3
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 1 3
```

The correct answer should be 3 because the path \(1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3\) has edges with weights 1, 2, and 3, which are strictly increasing. However, the provided code would incorrectly compute the maximum distance from vertex 1 to other vertices, which does not take into account the increasing weight constraint.

Thus, the code does not handle the required condition of strictly increasing edge weights and hence is incorrect.
