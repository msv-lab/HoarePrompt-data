Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the path with the maximum number of edges such that the weights of the edges increase along the path. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Graph Representation**: The program uses an adjacency list representation for the graph, which is efficient for querying and updating the maximum number of edges.
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The program iterates over all possible edge weights (from 1 to \(10^5\)), and for each weight, it updates the maximum number of edges that can be traversed from the vertices that have an edge of that weight.
3. **Memory Update**: For each edge \((u, v)\) with weight \(w\), the program checks if adding the edge increases the number of edges in the path. If so, it updates the memory array `mem` to reflect this new maximum.
4. **Final Result**: After processing all edge weights, the program finds the maximum value in the `mem` array, which represents the length of the longest path satisfying the condition.

Given the problem constraints and examples provided, the program correctly handles various scenarios, including paths with multiple edges and different weights. There are no apparent logical flaws or edge cases that the program does not handle correctly based on the provided code and examples.
