Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where multiple edges with the same weight exist. The given solution only considers the maximum path length for edges of increasing weights, but it fails to account for paths that can include multiple edges with the same weight.

For example, consider the following input:
```
6 7
1 2 1
3 2 5
2 4 2
2 5 2
2 6 9
5 4 3
4 3 4
```

The expected output should be 6 because the path `1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2` has 6 edges with strictly increasing weights. However, the current implementation will not correctly handle this case because it only updates the memory array based on the weight index, which means it may miss paths involving multiple edges with the same weight.

To fix this, the program needs to update the memory array for each edge considering the maximum path length that can be formed using edges of the same weight. This requires maintaining a separate data structure to track the longest path ending at each vertex for each weight, rather than just updating a single value for each weight index.
