Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the code uses a dynamic programming approach similar to a modified breadth-first search to find the maximum number of edges in a path where the weights strictly increase. However, the implementation has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Initialization**: The `mem` array is initialized with zeros, which means it will not correctly track paths starting from vertices other than 1. Since the problem requires finding the maximum number of edges for any path starting from any vertex, initializing `mem` with zeros is insufficient.

2. **Incorrect Edge Processing**: The code processes edges in increasing order of their weights. This is a good start, but it does not ensure that the path is a valid path with strictly increasing weights. For instance, consider the following graph:
   ```
   1 -> 2 (weight 1)
   2 -> 3 (weight 1)
   3 -> 4 (weight 2)
   1 -> 3 (weight 2)
   ```
   The code will process the edge `1 -> 3` before `2 -> 3`, but it does not ensure that the path `1 -> 2 -> 3` is considered before `1 -> 3`. This can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Missing Path Construction**: The code does not actually construct the path, it only computes the maximum number of edges. While this might seem like a minor issue, the problem specifically asks for the number of edges in the required path, not just the count.

To fix these issues, the code would need to:
- Initialize `mem` for each vertex to handle paths starting from different vertices.
- Ensure that paths are constructed correctly by maintaining a parent array or similar structure.
- Process edges in a way that ensures the path with strictly increasing weights is correctly identified.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
