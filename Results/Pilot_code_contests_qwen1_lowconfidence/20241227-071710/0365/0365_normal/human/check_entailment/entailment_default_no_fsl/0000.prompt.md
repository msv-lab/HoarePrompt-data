You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pashmak's homework is a problem about graphs. Although he always tries to do his homework completely, he can't solve this problem. As you know, he's really weak at graph theory; so try to help him in solving the problem.

You are given a weighted directed graph with n vertices and m edges. You need to find a path (perhaps, non-simple) with maximum number of edges, such that the weights of the edges increase along the path. In other words, each edge of the path must have strictly greater weight than the previous edge in the path.

Help Pashmak, print the number of edges in the required path.

Input

The first line contains two integers n, m (2 ≤ n ≤ 3·105; 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n·(n - 1), 3·105)). Then, m lines follows. The i-th line contains three space separated integers: ui, vi, wi (1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n; 1 ≤ wi ≤ 105) which indicates that there's a directed edge with weight wi from vertex ui to vertex vi.

It's guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain self-loops and multiple edges.

Output

Print a single integer — the answer to the problem.

In the first sample the maximum trail can be any of this trails: <image>.

In the second sample the maximum trail is <image>.

In the third sample the maximum trail is <image>.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rints_2d = lambda n: [rints() for _ in range(n)]
    (n, m) = rints()
    (mem, edges, weight) = ([0] * (n + 1), rints_2d(m), [[] for _ in range(10 ** 5 + 1)])
    for (u, v, w) in edges:
        weight[w].append((u, v))
    for i in range(1, 10 ** 5 + 1):
        all = [(v, mem[u]) for (u, v) in weight[i]]
        for (v, du) in all:
            mem[v] = max(mem[v], du + 1)
    print(max(mem))


```
Output hints: The function reads a directed graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges, where each edge is defined by a pair of vertices `(u, v)` and a positive integer weight `w`. It then computes the maximum distance from vertex 1 to every other vertex in the graph using a modified breadth-first search approach. The function stores these distances in the `mem` array and finally returns the maximum distance found. If the graph is disconnected or contains isolated vertices, the function still processes them according to the given rules. However, note that the function does not handle negative weights or self-loops explicitly, as per the problem statement.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
