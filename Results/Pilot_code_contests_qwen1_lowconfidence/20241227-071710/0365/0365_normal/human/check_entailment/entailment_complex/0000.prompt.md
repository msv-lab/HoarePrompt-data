You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Pashmak's homework is a problem about graphs. Although he always tries to do his homework completely, he can't solve this problem. As you know, he's really weak at graph theory; so try to help him in solving the problem.

You are given a weighted directed graph with n vertices and m edges. You need to find a path (perhaps, non-simple) with maximum number of edges, such that the weights of the edges increase along the path. In other words, each edge of the path must have strictly greater weight than the previous edge in the path.

Help Pashmak, print the number of edges in the required path.

Input

The first line contains two integers n, m (2 ≤ n ≤ 3·105; 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n·(n - 1), 3·105)). Then, m lines follows. The i-th line contains three space separated integers: ui, vi, wi (1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n; 1 ≤ wi ≤ 105) which indicates that there's a directed edge with weight wi from vertex ui to vertex vi.

It's guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain self-loops and multiple edges.

Output

Print a single integer — the answer to the problem.

In the third sample the maximum trail is <image>.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two integers n and m, followed by m lines, each containing three integers ui, vi, and wi, indicating a directed edge from vertex ui to vertex vi with weight wi. The graph does not contain self-loops or multiple edges, and the weights are positive integers not exceeding 10^5.
def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rints_2d = lambda n: [rints() for _ in range(n)]
    n, m = rints()
    mem, edges, weight = [0] * (n + 1), rints_2d(m), [[] for _ in range(10 ** 5 +
    1)]
    for (u, v, w) in edges:
        weight[w].append((u, v))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `edges` is a 2D list with `m` rows where each row is a tuple of three integers, `mem` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `weight` is a list of 100001 empty lists, where for each `w` in the `edges` list, the list `weight[w]` contains tuples `(u, v)` for each edge specified in the `edges` list.
    for i in range(1, 10 ** 5 + 1):
        all = [(v, mem[u]) for u, v in weight[i]]
        
        for v, du in all:
            mem[v] = max(mem[v], du + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 100001, `all` is an empty list, `mem[v]` is the maximum value of `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` in `all` for all `v` in `mem`.
    print(max(mem))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a directed graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges, where each edge is defined by a pair of vertices `(u, v)` and a positive integer weight `w`. It then computes the maximum distance from vertex 1 to every other vertex in the graph using a modified breadth-first search approach. The function stores these distances in the `mem` array and finally returns the maximum distance found. If the graph is disconnected or contains isolated vertices, the function still processes them according to the given rules. However, note that the function does not handle negative weights or self-loops explicitly, as per the problem statement.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
