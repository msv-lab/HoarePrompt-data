The function takes a list `a` of integers and two integers `N` and `K` as input, where `N` is the number of elements in `a`, `K` is the upper limit for the values in `a`, and `a` is sorted in increasing order. It constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` of length `K + 1` where `dp[i]` indicates whether it is possible to form the integer `i` using the values in `a`. After filling the `dp` array, it checks if it is possible to form the integer `K` using the values in `a`. If `dp[K]` is `True`, it writes "First" to standard output; otherwise, it writes "Second". This function essentially determines which player wins a game where players take turns removing elements from `a` and the player who cannot make a move loses.
