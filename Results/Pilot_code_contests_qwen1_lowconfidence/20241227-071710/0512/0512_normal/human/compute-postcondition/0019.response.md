The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided constraints and relationships, it seems the function should operate on some predefined or passed list `a` of integers, where each integer `a[i]` satisfies `1 ≤ a[i] ≤ K` and `a[i] < a[i+1]` for all `i`. The constraints also specify that `N` is an integer such that `1 ≤ N ≤ 100` and `K` is an integer such that `1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5`.

Given the output cases are not explicitly defined, we infer the function might return something based on the properties of the list `a` and the constraints on `N` and `K`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers (with implicit constraints on the length and values within the list), and returns a value based on the properties of the list and the given constraints on `N` and `K`.**
