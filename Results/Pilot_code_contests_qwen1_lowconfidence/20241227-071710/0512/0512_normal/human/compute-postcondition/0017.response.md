To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the given output states step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Loop Code
```python
for i in xrange(max(a) + 1, k + 1):
    dp[i] = any(not dp[i - ai] for ai in a)
```

This loop starts from `i = max(a) + 1` and iterates up to `k + 1`. For each `i`, it updates `dp[i]` based on whether there exists any `ai` in `a` such that `dp[i - ai]` is `False`.

#### Initial Conditions
- `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 100\).
- `K` is an integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `dp` is a list of length `K + 1` with all elements initialized to `False` except for `dp[ai]` which is `True` for each `ai` in `a`.

#### Observations from Given Output States
1. **First Iteration**:
   - `max(a) + 1` is less than or equal to `k + 1`.
   - `dp` is updated to reflect the current value of `i`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 each time.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `max(a) + 1` is less than or equal to `k + 1`.
   - `dp` is updated to reflect the current value of `i`.
   - `i` is incremented by 2 (from the previous `i` value).

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - `max(a) + 1` is less than or equal to `k + 1`.
   - `dp` is updated to reflect the current value of `i`.
   - `i` is incremented by 2 again.

From these observations, we can infer that the loop continues until `i` reaches `k + 1`. During this process, `dp[i]` is set to `True` if there exists any `ai` in `a` such that `dp[i - ai]` is `False`.

#### Final State Analysis
- **Final Value of `i`**: The loop will terminate when `i` reaches `k + 1`.
- **Final State of `dp`**: After the loop, `dp[i]` will be `True` for all `i` in the range `[max(a) + 1, k + 1]` if it is possible to form `i` using the values in `a`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` will remain `False` for those `i`.

#### Conclusion
Given that the loop runs until `i` reaches `k + 1`, and updates `dp[i]` based on the condition specified, the final state of the variables will be as follows:

- `max(a) + 1` is less than or equal to `k + 1`.
- `N` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 100\).
- `K` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq 10^5\).
- `a` remains a list of integers.
- `dp` is a list of length `K + 1` where `dp[i]` is `True` for all `i` in the range `[max(a) + 1, k + 1]` if it is possible to form `i` using the values in `a`, otherwise `dp[i]` is `False`.

### Output State
Output State: **`max(a) + 1` is less than or equal to `k + 1`, `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 100\), `K` is an integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers, `dp` is a list of length `K + 1` with `dp[i]` being `True` for all `i` in the range `[max(a) + 1, k + 1]` if it is possible to form `i` using the values in `a`, otherwise `dp[i]` is `False`.**
