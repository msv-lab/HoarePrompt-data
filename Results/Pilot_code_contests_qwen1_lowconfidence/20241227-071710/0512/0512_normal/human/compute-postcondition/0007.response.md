The code snippet `dp[ai] = True` sets the value of `dp[ai]` to `True`. Here, `ai` is an element from the list `a`. The previous state of `dp` was such that all elements were initialized to `False` except for `dp[next_ai]`, which was `True`, where `next_ai` is the next element in the list `a`.

After executing the line `dp[ai] = True`, the value of `dp[next_ai]` remains `True`, and the value of `dp[ai]` becomes `True`. All other elements of `dp` remain `False`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 100\), `K` is an integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers, `dp` is a list of length `K + 1` with all elements initialized to `False` except for `dp[next_ai]` which is `True`, now `dp[ai]` is also `True`**
