The code initializes a list `dp` with `False` values, where the length of the list is `k + 1`. This does not affect the values of `N`, `K`, `a`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, the only change is in the initialization of the `dp` list.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100; `K` is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `n` is the first integer read from input; `k` is the second integer read from input; `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` with all elements initialized to `False`.**
