Functionality: **The function takes a list `a` of integers and two integers `N` and `K` as input, where `N` is the number of elements in `a`, `K` is the upper limit for the values in `a`, and `a` is sorted in increasing order. It constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` of length `K + 1` where `dp[i]` indicates whether it is possible to form the integer `i` using the values in `a`. After filling the `dp` array, it checks if it is possible to form the integer `K` using the values in `a`. If `dp[K]` is `True`, it writes "First" to standard output; otherwise, it writes "Second". This function essentially determines which player wins a game where players take turns removing elements from `a` and the player who cannot make a move loses.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function assumes that the input list `a` is already sorted in increasing order, which is a constraint mentioned in the initial state. If the input list is not sorted, the function will still proceed, but the results may be incorrect. To handle this, the function should include a check to ensure that `a` is sorted.
- The function does not handle the case where `K` is 0. In this scenario, the function should return "Second" since no elements can be taken, making it impossible to form any positive integer.
- The function does not validate the constraints on `N` and `K` explicitly. While the initial state mentions these constraints, the function should include checks to ensure that `1 ≤ N ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5`. If these constraints are violated, the function should raise an appropriate error or handle the situation accordingly.
