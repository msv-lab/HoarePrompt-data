`a` is assigned a new list of integers by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. The values of `N`, `K`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100; `K` is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `n` is the first integer read from input; `k` is the second integer read from input.**
