Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop conditions**: The loop runs from `max(a) + 1` to `k + 1`.

2. **Determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` must be in the range `[max(a) + 1, k + 1)`. This means `i` should start from `max(a) + 1` and go up to but not including `k + 1`.
   - Since `i` starts from `max(a) + 1`, we need to ensure that `max(a) + 1` is within the specified range for `i`.

3. **Analyze the initial state**:
   - `N` and `K` are given as integers within specific ranges: \(1 \leq N \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq K \leq 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `dp` is a list of length `K + 1` with all elements initialized to `False` except for `dp[ai]` which is `True` for each `ai` in `a`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be at least `max(a) + 1`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `max(a) + 1` is within the range `[max(a) + 1, k + 1)`. This implies that `k` must be at least `max(a) + 1`.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `max(a) + 1` should be less than or equal to `k + 1` (or equivalently, `k` should be at least `max(a)`).

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`max(a) + 1` is less than or equal to `k + 1`, `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 100\), `K` is an integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers, `dp` is a list of length `K + 1` with all elements initialized to `False` except for `dp[ai]` which is `True` for each `ai` in `a`.**
