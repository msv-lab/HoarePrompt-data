The code reads two integers from standard input using the custom `input` function and splits them, converting them to integers using `map(int)`. This means that `n` and `k` are assigned the respective integers read from input. The values of `N` and `K` are no longer specific but are constrained by the same ranges, and the list `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100; `K` is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers representing A such that 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ K and a[i] < a[i+1] for all i; `n` is the first integer read from input; `k` is the second integer read from input.**
