The code `dp[ai] = True` sets the element in the `dp` list at index `ai` to `True`. The value of `ai` comes from the list `a`, which was read from input. Since the exact value of `ai` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it is an integer that is within the range of the `dp` list (i.e., `0 <= ai <= k`). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 100\), `K` is an integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least one element, `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` with all elements initialized to `False` except for `dp[ai]` which is `True`**
