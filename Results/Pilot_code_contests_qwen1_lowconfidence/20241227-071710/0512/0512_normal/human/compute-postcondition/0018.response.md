The code `os.write(1, 'First' if dp[k] else 'Second')` checks the value of `dp[k]` and writes 'First' if `dp[k]` is `True`, otherwise it writes 'Second'. However, this does not change the values of any variables. The only impact is on the output, which depends on the value of `dp[k]`.

Given the initial state:
- `max(a) + 1` is less than or equal to `k + 1`
- `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 100\)
- `K` is an integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of integers
- `dp` is a list of length `K + 1` with `dp[i]` being `True` for all `i` in the range `[max(a) + 1, k + 1]` if it is possible to form `i` using the values in `a`, otherwise `dp[i]` is `False`

Since `dp[k]` is `True` (as per the condition given in the initial state), the output will be 'First'.

Output State: **`max(a) + 1` is less than or equal to `k + 1`, `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 100\), `K` is an integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers, `dp` is a list of length `K + 1` with `dp[i]` being `True` for all `i` in the range `[max(a) + 1, k + 1]` if it is possible to form `i` using the values in `a`, otherwise `dp[i]` is `False`, the output is 'First'.**
