Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the input values for `N`, `K`, and the list `a` correctly.
   - It uses dynamic programming to solve the problem, which is a suitable approach for determining the winner in the game described.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table (`dp`)**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized to `False` for all indices, indicating that no integer can be formed initially.
   - For each element `ai` in `a`, `dp[ai]` is set to `True` because it's possible to form `ai` using `ai` itself.
   - The second for loop iterates from `max(a) + 1` to `k + 1` and sets `dp[i]` to `True` if any combination of elements in `a` can form `i`. This ensures that the `dp` table is filled correctly according to the game rules.

3. **Winning Condition Check**:
   - After constructing the `dp` table, the program checks if `dp[k]` is `True`. If it is, Taro (First player) can force a win, so it outputs "First". Otherwise, it outputs "Second".

4. **Optimal Play Assumption**:
   - The program assumes optimal play from both players, which aligns with the problem statement where both players play optimally.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the solution to the described game problem, handling all constraints and requirements accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
