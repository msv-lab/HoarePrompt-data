Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem. Specifically, the code constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` to determine if it is possible to form the integer `K` using the values in `a`, but this approach does not account for the optimal strategy of the game. 

For instance, consider the following case:
- Input: 
  ```
  2 5
  2 3
  ```

According to the problem description, both players play optimally, and the game is won by the player who cannot make a move. The optimal strategy involves considering the remaining stones after each move and determining if the opponent can force a loss. 

However, the current implementation checks if it is possible to form `K` using the values in `a` but does not simulate the alternating moves between Taro and Jiro to determine the winner. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to simulate the game by checking the possible moves for each player and determining the winner based on the optimal strategy. The current implementation fails to do this, leading to incorrect outputs for certain cases.
