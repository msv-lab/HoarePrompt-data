Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming, but it contains a logical error. Specifically, the line `dp[i] = any((not dp[i - ai] for ai in a))` is incorrect. This line checks if any of the previous states allow the opponent to win, which is not the correct approach for this problem.

The correct approach is to determine if the current player can force a win from the current state. The corrected logic should be:

- If there exists any `ai` such that `dp[i - ai]` is `False`, then the current player can win by removing `ai` stones.
- Otherwise, the current player cannot win.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted([int(i) for i in input().split()])
    dp = [False] * (k + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        dp[i] = any(not dp[i - ai] for ai in a if i - ai >= 0)
    
    os.write(1, 'First' if dp[k] else 'Second')
```

This corrected version ensures that the current player can force a win if there exists any `ai` such that the opponent would lose from the state `i - ai`.
