Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. The code constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` to determine if it is possible to form the integer `K` using the values in `a`. However, the game requires determining the winner based on who can no longer make a move, not just checking if a certain number of stones can be formed.

The game logic should involve determining the winning strategy based on the Nim game theory, specifically the XOR of the pile size and the set of available moves. The provided code does not consider the optimal strategy for the game, which is essential for determining the winner.

For example, consider the following case:

Input:
```
2 5
2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
Second
```

However, the provided code would incorrectly output:
```
First
```

This is because the code does not correctly simulate the alternating moves and determine the winner based on the optimal strategy. The code checks if it is possible to form `K` using the values in `a`, but it does not simulate the game rounds and determine the winner based on the remaining stones after each move.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to implement the Nim game logic, which involves checking the XOR of the current pile size and the available moves. If the result is non-zero, the first player has a winning strategy; otherwise, the second player wins.
