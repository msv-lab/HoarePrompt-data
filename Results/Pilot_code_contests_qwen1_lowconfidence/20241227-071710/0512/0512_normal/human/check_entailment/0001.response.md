Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not handle the case where the maximum element in set \(A\) is greater than half of \(K\). This is a critical edge case because if the maximum element in \(A\) is larger than \(K/2\), the first player (Taro) can always reduce the pile to a value that forces the second player (Jiro) into a losing position.

For example, consider the input:
```
2 6
2 5
```

In this case, the maximum element in \(A\) is 5, which is greater than \(K/2 = 3\). According to the problem description, if the maximum element in \(A\) is greater than \(K/2\), the second player (Jiro) wins. However, the given program does not account for this scenario and incorrectly outputs "First" instead of "Second".

To fix this, the program needs to check if the maximum element in \(A\) is greater than \(K/2\) and handle this case appropriately.
