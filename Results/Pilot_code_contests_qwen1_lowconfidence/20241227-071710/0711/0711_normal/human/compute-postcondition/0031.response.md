Postcondition: ***`total` is 10, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `alpha` is the first `k` uppercase English letters, `ans1` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `ans2` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `rec1` is an integer that is increased by 1 if `i > 0 and s[i] == s[i - 1] or (i < n - 1 and s[i] == s[i + 1])`, `rec2` is 0, and `neigh` is a tuple containing the characters at indices `i - 1` and `i + 1` if applicable. If the condition `i > 0 and s[i] == s[i - 1] or (i < n - 1 and s[i] == s[i + 1])` is true, then `ans1[i]` is `chosen`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
