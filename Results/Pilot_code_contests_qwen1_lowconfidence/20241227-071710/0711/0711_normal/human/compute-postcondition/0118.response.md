The code `break` does not change any variable values. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Since there is no loop or conditional statement affecting these variables, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`alpha` contains at least one character, `c` is the next character in `alpha`, `neigh` must contain characters from which no `c` is excluded, `chosen` is `c`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
