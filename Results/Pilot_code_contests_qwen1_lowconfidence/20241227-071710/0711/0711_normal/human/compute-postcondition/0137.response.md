The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `alpha`, `neigh`, and `chosen`. It simply breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match case, but since no loop or match case is mentioned in the initial state, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`alpha` is a non-empty sequence, `neigh` is either `', s[i - 1], s[i + 1]'` if `i > 0`, or `', s[i + 1]'` if `i <= 0`, and `chosen` is equal to `c'.**
