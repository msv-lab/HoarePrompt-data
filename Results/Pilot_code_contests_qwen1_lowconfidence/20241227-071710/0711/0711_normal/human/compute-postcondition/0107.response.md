The code snippet `neigh += s[i - 1],` appends the value of `s[i - 1]` to the tuple `neigh`. Initially, `neigh` is an empty tuple `()`. The operation `+=` for tuples is equivalent to concatenation, so `neigh` will become `(s[i - 1],)`. However, since the value of `s[i - 1]` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value. We only know that `neigh` has been updated to include this new element.

Output State: **`neigh` is (s[i - 1],)**
