Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a string of length at least 2, `alpha` is the first `k` uppercase English letters, `ans1` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `ans2` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `rec1` is the total number of times the inner loop executed, `rec2` is either 0 or 1, `neigh` is `s[0] + s[1]`, and `i` is 1. If `i > 0` and `s[i] == s[i - 1]` or `i < n - 1` and `s[i] == s[i + 1]`, then `ans2[1]` is a character from `s` that is not in `neigh`. Otherwise, no changes occur in `rec2`.***
