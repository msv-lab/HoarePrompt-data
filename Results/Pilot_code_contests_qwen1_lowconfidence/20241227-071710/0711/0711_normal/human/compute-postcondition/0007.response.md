The line `neigh = ()` creates an empty tuple and assigns it to the variable `neigh`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of an empty tuple to `neigh`.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `alpha` is the first `k` uppercase English letters, `ans1` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `ans2` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `rec1` is 0, `rec2` is 0, `neigh` is an empty tuple ()**
