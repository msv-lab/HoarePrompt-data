Postcondition: ***`neigh` is either `', s[i - 1], s[i + 1]'` if `i > 0`, or `', s[i + 1]'` if `i <= 0`. If `i > 0` and `s[i] == s[i - 1]` or `(i < n - 1 and s[i] == s[i + 1])`, then `rec2` is 1, `neigh` is `', s[i - 1], s[i + 1]'`, `chosen` is 'a', `i` is the index of 'a', and `ans2[i]` is 'a'. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as the precondition.***
