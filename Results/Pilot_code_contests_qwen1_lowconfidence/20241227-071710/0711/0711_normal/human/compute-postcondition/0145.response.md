The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `alpha`, `neigh`, `i`, and `chosen`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no loop or if statement in the initial state, the break statement does not change any variable values.

Output State: **`alpha` is a non-empty sequence with one less character, `neigh` is ', s[i - 1]', and `i` is the index of the second-to-last character in the new `alpha`; `chosen` is `c`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
