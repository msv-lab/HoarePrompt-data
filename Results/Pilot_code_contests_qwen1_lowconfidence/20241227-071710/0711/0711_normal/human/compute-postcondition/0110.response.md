Postcondition: ***`neigh` is a tuple containing at most two elements from the sequence `s`. If `i > 0` and `i < n - 1`, `neigh` is `(s[i - 1], s[i + 1])`. If `i = 0` or `i >= n - 1`, `neigh` is `(s[i],)`. If `i == n - 1`, `neigh` remains an empty tuple `()` unless `i > 0`, in which case `neigh` is `(s[i - 1],)`.***
