The given code snippet `ans1[i] = chosen` updates the value of the element in the list `ans1` at index `i` to `chosen`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `ans1`, `i`, or `chosen`. Therefore, we can only state that the element at index `i` in the list `ans1` is now `chosen`.

Output State: **`ans1[i]` is `chosen`**
