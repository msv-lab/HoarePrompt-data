Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is `len(ans1) - 1`.
   - `len(ans1)` is at least 2.
   - `valid1` is `False` if at any point `ans1[i]` equals `ans1[i - 1]`, otherwise `valid1` retains its original value (`True` if no such `i` exists).
   - `valid2` is `True`.

2. **For Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, len(ans2))`.

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - The loop will start as long as `len(ans2)` is at least 1.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `len(ans2) - 1`. Therefore, `len(ans2)` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `i` is `len(ans1) - 1`, but this value is irrelevant for the loop since the loop starts from 1. We only need to ensure that `len(ans2)` is at least 1.
   - The values of `valid1` and `valid2` are already given and do not affect the loop's ability to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `len(ans2)` must be at least 1.

**State:**
- **`len(ans2)` must be at least 1**.
