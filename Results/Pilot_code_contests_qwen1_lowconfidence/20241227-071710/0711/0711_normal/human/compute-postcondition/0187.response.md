The code `print(''.join(ans2))` joins all elements of the list `ans2` into a single string without any separators and then prints it. This operation does not change the values of `ans2`, `i`, `valid2`, or `rec2`. The print statement itself does not assign a value to any variable; it only outputs the joined string.

Output State: **`ans2` is a list of elements, `i` is an index such that `1 <= i < len(ans2)`, `valid2` is `True` if no duplicate element is found in `ans2`, otherwise `valid2` is `False`, and the value of `rec2` is printed. The string `''.join(ans2)` is printed.**
