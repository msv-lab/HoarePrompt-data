Postcondition: ***`total` is 10, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `alpha` is the first `k` uppercase English letters, `ans1` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `ans2` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `rec1` is 0, `rec2` is 0, `neigh` is a tuple containing the character at index `i - 1` of `s`. If `i > 0`, the current value of `i` is greater than 0 and `neigh` includes the character at index `i - 1` of `s`. Since there is no else part, the overall postcondition remains as the condition inside the if statement.***
