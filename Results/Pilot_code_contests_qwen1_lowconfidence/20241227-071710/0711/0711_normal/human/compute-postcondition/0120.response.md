Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Current States:**
   - `alpha` contains at least one character.
   - `c` is the next character in `alpha`.
   - `neigh` must contain characters from which no `c` is excluded.
   - `chosen` is either `c` (if `c` is not in `neigh`) or remains unchanged (if `c` is already in `neigh`).

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in `alpha`.

3. **Determine the Next Character `c`:**
   - Since `c` is the next character in `alpha`, it means we have already processed the current `c` and now we need to consider the next character.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `alpha` will lose the first character (`c`) because it has been processed.
   - `c` will be updated to the next character in `alpha`.
   - `neigh` must still contain characters from which no `c` is excluded.
   - `chosen` will be determined based on the new value of `c` and the current state of `neigh`.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `alpha` will have at least one less character than before.
   - `c` will be the next character in the updated `alpha`.
   - `neigh` must still contain characters from which no `c` is excluded.
   - `chosen` will be either `c` (if `c` is not in `neigh`) or remains unchanged (if `c` is already in `neigh`).

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`alpha` contains at least one less character than before, `c` is the next character in `alpha`, `neigh` must contain characters from which no `c` is excluded, and `chosen` is either `c` (if `c` is not in `neigh`) or remains unchanged (if `c` is already in `neigh`).**
