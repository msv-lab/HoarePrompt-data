Postcondition: ***`total` is 10, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `alpha` must contain at least one character, `ans1` and `ans2` are lists of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `rec1` is either its original value or incremented by 1 depending on the condition, `rec2` is 0, and `neigh` is a tuple containing the characters `s[i - 1]` and `s[i + 1]` if `i > 0`, otherwise it is a tuple containing only `s[i + 1]` if `i <= 0. The current value of `c` is not in the tuple `neigh`***
