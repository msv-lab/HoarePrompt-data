The code `print(rec2)` prints the value of `rec2`, but it does not change the value of any variables. Therefore, the only change is that the value of `rec2` is printed. The variables `ans2`, `i`, and `valid2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans2` is a list of elements, `i` is an index such that `1 <= i < len(ans2)`, `valid2` is `True` if no duplicate element is found in `ans2`, otherwise `valid2` is `False`, and the value of `rec2` is printed.**
