Postcondition: ***`neigh` is a tuple containing at most two elements from the sequence `s`. If `i > 0` and `i < n - 1`, `neigh` is `(s[i - 1], s[i + 1])`. If `i = 0` or `i >= n - 1`, `neigh` is `(s[i],)`. If `i == n - 1`, `neigh` remains an empty tuple `()` unless `i > 0`, in which case `neigh` is `(s[i - 1],)`. If `i > 0` and `s[i] == s[i - 1]` or (`i < n - 1` and `s[i] == s[i + 1]`), then `alpha` is an empty string, `chosen` is the first character in `alpha` that is not in `neigh`, `neigh` is a tuple containing characters from which no character in `alpha` is excluded, `ans2` has been updated at index `i` with the value of `chosen`, and `rec2` is increased by 1. If the condition is not met, the variables retain their original values.***
