Postcondition: ***`total` is 10, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer (at least 1), `s` is a string of length `n`, `alpha` is the first `k` uppercase English letters (must contain at least one character), `ans1` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `ans2` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `rec1` is 0, `rec2` is 0, `neigh` is a tuple containing the characters at indices `i - 1` and `i + 1` (if `i < n - 1`), and `chosen` is equal to `c`. If `c` is not in `neigh`, then `c` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the program variables remains as per the precondition.***
