The code sets `valid1` to `False`. This directly changes the value of `valid1`. The values of `i` and `len(ans1)` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated states are as follows:

- `i` is 2
- `len(ans1)` is at least 2
- `valid1` is `False`

Output State: **`i` is 2, `len(ans1)` is at least 2, `valid1` is `False`**
