Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `alpha` contains at least one character. The loop iterates over each character `c` in `alpha`.

2. **Loop Behavior**: For each character `c` in `alpha`, the following actions are taken:
   - If `c` is a character not in `neigh`, then `chosen` is set to `c` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. This means that once a suitable `c` is found, no further iterations of the loop will be executed.
   - If `c` is in `neigh`, no changes occur.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration State**:
   - Since the loop continues to iterate as long as there are characters left in `alpha` and none of them are broken out of the loop due to being in `neigh`, we need to consider two possible scenarios for the next iteration:
     1. If `alpha` still contains characters and the current character `c` is not in `neigh`, the loop will continue with the next character.
     2. If `alpha` still contains characters but the current character `c` is in `neigh`, no changes will occur and the loop will continue with the next character.

Given these considerations, the only thing that changes is the value of `c` (which moves to the next character in `alpha`). The values of `alpha` and `neigh` remain the same unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not mentioned here.

Therefore, the state remains the same except for the change in `c` to the next character in `alpha`.

**Final State**:
- `alpha` contains at least one character.
- `c` is now the next character in `alpha`.
- `neigh` remains unchanged.
- `chosen` remains unchanged unless a suitable `c` was found in the previous iteration, but since no such action is indicated, it remains unchanged.

State: **`alpha` contains at least one character, `c` is the next character in `alpha`, `neigh` must contain characters from which no `c` is excluded, `chosen` remains unchanged**
