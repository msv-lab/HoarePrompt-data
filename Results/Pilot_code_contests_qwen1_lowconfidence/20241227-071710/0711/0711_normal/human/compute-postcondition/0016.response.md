Postcondition: **`total` is 10, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer (at least 1), `s` is a string of length `n`, `alpha` is the first `k` uppercase English letters (must contain at least one character), `ans1` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `ans2` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `rec1` is 0, `rec2` is 0, `neigh` is a tuple containing the characters at indices `i - 1` and `i + 1`. If `i < n - 1`, `neigh` includes the character at index `i + 1`. Otherwise, the conditions remain as specified in the precondition. Additionally, the current value of `s[i]` is equal to either `s[i - 1]` or `s[i + 1]` (if `i < n - 1`). The character `c` is not in the tuple `neigh`.**
