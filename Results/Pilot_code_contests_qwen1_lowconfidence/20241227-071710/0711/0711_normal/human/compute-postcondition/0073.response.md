Postcondition: ***`total` is 10, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `alpha` must contain at least one remaining character (next character in `alpha`), `ans1` and `ans2` are lists of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `rec1` is incremented by 1, `rec2` is 0, `neigh` is a tuple containing the characters `s[i - 1]` and `s[i + 1]` if `i > 0`, otherwise it is a tuple containing only `s[i + 1]` if `i <= 0`, and `chosen` is `c`. If `c` is not in `neigh`, we break out of the most internal loop or match-case statement.***
