Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a string of length at least 2, `alpha` is the first `k` uppercase English letters, `ans1` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `ans2` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `rec1` is the total number of times the inner loop executed, `rec2` is 0, `neigh` is `s[0] + s[1]`, `i` is 1. Additionally, `i` is greater than 0 and the character at index `i` in `s` is equal to the character at index `i - 1` in `s` or the character at index `i` in `s` is equal to the character at index `i + 1` in `s`.***
