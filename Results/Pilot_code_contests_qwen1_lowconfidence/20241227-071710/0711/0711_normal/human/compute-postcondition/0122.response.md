The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the current loop or nested structure. Since there is no indication that the `break` statement is inside a loop or nested structure in this context, the variables `alpha`, `c`, `neigh`, and `chosen` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`alpha` contains at least one less character than before, `c` is the next character in `alpha`, `neigh` must contain characters from which no `c` is excluded, and `chosen` is `c`.**
