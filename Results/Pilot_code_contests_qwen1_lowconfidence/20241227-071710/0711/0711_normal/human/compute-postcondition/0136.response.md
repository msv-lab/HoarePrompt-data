`chosen` is assigned the value of `c`. The values of `alpha` and `neigh` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the assignment. The output state is: `alpha` is a non-empty sequence, `neigh` is either `', s[i - 1], s[i + 1]'` if `i > 0`, or `', s[i + 1]'` if `i <= 0`, and `chosen` is equal to `c`.

Output State: **`alpha` is a non-empty sequence, `neigh` is either `', s[i - 1], s[i + 1]'` if `i > 0`, or `', s[i + 1]'` if `i <= 0`, and `chosen` is equal to `c`.**
