The code `print(rec1)` simply prints the value of `rec1`. This does not change the value of any variable. The other variables (`ans2`, `i`, `valid2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans2` is a list of elements, `i` is an index such that `1 <= i < len(ans2)`, `valid2` is `False` if a duplicate element is found in `ans2`, otherwise `valid2` is `True`, and `rec1` is printed.**
