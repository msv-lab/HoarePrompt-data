The code assigns the value of `c` to `chosen`. The previous value of `chosen` is unchanged, `alpha` and `neigh` remain the same as their initial conditions. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`alpha` contains at least one character, `c` is the next character in `alpha`, `neigh` must contain characters from which no `c` is excluded, `chosen` is `c`**
