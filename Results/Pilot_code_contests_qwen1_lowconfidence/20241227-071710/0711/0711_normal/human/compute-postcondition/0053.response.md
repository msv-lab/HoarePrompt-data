The value of `rec1` is incremented by 1, changing its value from its original value to `rec1 + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `alpha` contains the first `k` uppercase English letters, `ans1` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `ans2` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `rec1` is `rec1 + 1`, `rec2` is 0, and `neigh` is a tuple containing the characters `s[i - 1]` and `s[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`. Otherwise, `neigh` remains an empty tuple.
