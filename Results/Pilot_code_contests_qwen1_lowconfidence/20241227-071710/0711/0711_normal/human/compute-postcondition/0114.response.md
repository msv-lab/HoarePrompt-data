The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block specified to be exited here, the only impact is the indication that we would break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `alpha`, `c`, and `chosen` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`alpha` contains at least one character, `c` is a character not in `neigh`, `chosen` is `c`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
