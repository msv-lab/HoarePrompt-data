Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `alpha` is the first `k` uppercase English letters, `ans1` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `ans2` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `rec1` is the total number of times the inner loop executed, `rec2` is either 0 or the number of times the condition `i > 0 and s[i] == s[i - 1] or (i < n - 1 and s[i] == s[i + 1])` was met, `neigh` is a tuple containing characters from which no character in `alpha` is excluded, and `i` is the last executed index in the loop. If the condition `i > 0 and s[i] == s[i - 1] or (i < n - 1 and s[i] == s[i + 1])` is true for any `i`, then `ans2[i]` is a character from `s` that is not in `neigh`, and `rec2` is incremented accordingly. Otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged for those indices.**
