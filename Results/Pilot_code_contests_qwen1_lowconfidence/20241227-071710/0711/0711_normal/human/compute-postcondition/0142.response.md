Postcondition: ***`alpha` is a non-empty sequence, `neigh` is `', s[i - 1]'`, and `i` is the index of the second-to-last character in `alpha`. If `c` is not in `neigh`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, no additional changes occur if `c` is in `neigh`.***
