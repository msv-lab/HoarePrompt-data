The code `break` is used to exit the current loop or the most internal loop or if statement we are in. In this case, since there is no loop or if statement present, the value of the variables does not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. 

Output State: **`ans2` is a list of elements, `i` is an index such that `1 <= i < len(ans2)`, and `valid2` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
