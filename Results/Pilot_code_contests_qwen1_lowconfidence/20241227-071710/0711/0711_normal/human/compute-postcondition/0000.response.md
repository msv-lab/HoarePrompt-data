The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input and splits them using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This means that `n` and `k` are now integers obtained from the input. The string mentioned in the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from the input, `k` is an integer obtained from the input, and the string of length `n` consisting of `k` distinct uppercase English letters remains unchanged.**
