Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1, `s` is a string of length at least 2, `alpha` is the first `k` uppercase English letters, `ans1` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `ans2` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `rec1` is the total number of times the inner loop executed, `rec2` is 0, `neigh` is `s[0] + s[1]`, `i` is 1, and `c` is a character from `s`. If `c` is not in `neigh`, `chosen` is undefined after the break; otherwise, no change to the variables' states.***
