The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement we were inside. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement affecting the variables `ans2`, `i`, and `valid2`, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans2` is a list of elements, `i` is an index such that `1 <= i < len(ans2) - 1`, and `valid2` is `False`.**
