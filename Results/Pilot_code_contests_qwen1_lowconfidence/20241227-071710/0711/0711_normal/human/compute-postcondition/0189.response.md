The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers. The constraints are 1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 26. The second input is a string of length `n` consisting of `k` distinct uppercase English letters, where each letter represents the color of the corresponding cell in the stripe. 

Based on the provided output cases, the function does not explicitly return anything from the given snippet. However, considering typical problem setups, the function likely processes the string and returns some result related to the stripe's properties. Since no specific output cases are provided, we can only describe the parameters.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two parameters, `n` and `k`, and a string of length `n` consisting of `k` distinct uppercase English letters, representing a colored stripe.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, and a string of length `n` consisting of `k` distinct uppercase English letters.**
