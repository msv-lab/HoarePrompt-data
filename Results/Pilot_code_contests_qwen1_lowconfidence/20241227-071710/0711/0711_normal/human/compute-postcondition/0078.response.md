Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `alpha` is the first `k` uppercase English letters, `ans1` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `ans2` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `rec1` is the total number of times the inner loop executed (incremented by 1 if `i > 0 and s[i] == s[i - 1] or (i < n - 1 and s[i] == s[i + 1])` for any `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 1`), `rec2` is 0, and `neigh` is a tuple containing the characters `s[i - 1]` and `s[i + 1]` if `i > 0` and `i < n - 1`, only `s[i - 1]` if `i == 0`, and only `s[i + 1]` if `i == n - 1`. If the condition `i > 0 and s[i] == s[i - 1] or (i < n - 1 and s[i] == s[i + 1])` is true for any `i`, then `ans1[i]` is set to `chosen`. Otherwise, `ans1[i]` retains its original value.**
