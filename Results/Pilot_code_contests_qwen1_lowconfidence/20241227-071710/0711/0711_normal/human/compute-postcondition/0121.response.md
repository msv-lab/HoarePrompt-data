`chosen` is assigned the value of `c`. According to the precondition, `c` is the next character in `alpha`, and `neigh` must contain characters from which no `c` is excluded, and `chosen` is either `c` (if `c` is not in `neigh`) or remains unchanged (if `c` is already in `neigh`). Since `chosen` is now explicitly set to `c`, it will be `c` regardless of whether `c` is in `neigh` or not.

Output State: **`alpha` contains at least one less character than before, `c` is the next character in `alpha`, `neigh` must contain characters from which no `c` is excluded, and `chosen` is `c`.**
