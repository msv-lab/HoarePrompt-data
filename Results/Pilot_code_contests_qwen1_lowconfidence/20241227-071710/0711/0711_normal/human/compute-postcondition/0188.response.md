Postcondition: ***`ans2` is a list of elements, `i` is an index such that `1 <= i < len(ans2)`, and `valid2` is `False` if a duplicate element is found in `ans2`, otherwise `valid2` is `True`. If `rec1 < rec2` and `valid1` is `True` or `not valid2` is `True`, then `rec1` is printed, and there is a NameError due to the undefined variable `ans1`. Otherwise, `rec2` is printed, and the string `''.join(ans2)` is printed.***
