Postcondition: ***`total` is 10, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `alpha` must contain at least one character, `ans1` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `ans2` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a character from `s`, `rec1` is an integer that may or may not have changed, and `rec2` is 0. Additionally, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional context if the character `c` is not in the tuple `neigh`.***
