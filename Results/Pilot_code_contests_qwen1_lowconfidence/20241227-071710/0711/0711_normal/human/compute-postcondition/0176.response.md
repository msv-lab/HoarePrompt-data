Postcondition: ***`ans2` is a list of elements, `i` is an index such that `1 <= i < len(ans2)`, and `valid2` remains unchanged. If `ans2[i]` equals `ans2[i - 1]`, then `valid2` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `ans2[i]` does not equal `ans2[i - 1]`, `valid2` remains unchanged.***
