The code snippet prints the elements of `ans1` joined into a single string. However, there is no definition or initialization of `ans1` in the provided initial state. Since `ans1` is not defined, the code will raise a NameError. Given this, the variables `ans2`, `i`, `valid2`, and `rec1` remain unchanged, and the code cannot proceed without an error.

Output State: **`ans2` is a list of elements, `i` is an index such that `1 <= i < len(ans2)`, `valid2` is `False` if a duplicate element is found in `ans2`, otherwise `valid2` is `True`, and `rec1` is printed, and there is a NameError due to the undefined variable `ans1`.**
