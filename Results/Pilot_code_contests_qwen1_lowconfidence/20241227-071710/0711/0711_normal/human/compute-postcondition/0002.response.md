The code `alpha = string.uppercase[:k]` assigns the first `k` characters from the string `string.uppercase` to the variable `alpha`. `string.uppercase` is a string containing all uppercase English letters, i.e., "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ". Since `k` is an integer obtained from the input, `alpha` will contain the first `k` uppercase English letters.

- The initial state of `n` is an integer obtained from the input.
- The initial state of `k` is an integer obtained from the input.
- The initial state of `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of `k` distinct uppercase English letters.

After executing the code, `alpha` will contain the first `k` uppercase English letters, while `n`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from the input, `k` is an integer obtained from the input, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of `k` distinct uppercase English letters, `alpha` is the first `k` uppercase English letters**
