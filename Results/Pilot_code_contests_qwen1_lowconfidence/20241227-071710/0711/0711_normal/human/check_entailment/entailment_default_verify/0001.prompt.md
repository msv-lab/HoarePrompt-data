You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A colored stripe is represented by a horizontal row of n square cells, each cell is pained one of k colors. Your task is to repaint the minimum number of cells so that no two neighbouring cells are of the same color. You can use any color from 1 to k to repaint the cells.

Input

The first input line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105; 2 ≤ k ≤ 26). The second line contains n uppercase English letters. Letter "A" stands for the first color, letter "B" stands for the second color and so on. The first k English letters may be used. Each letter represents the color of the corresponding cell of the stripe.

Output

Print a single integer — the required minimum number of repaintings. In the second line print any possible variant of the repainted stripe.

        print(rec1)

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem by only considering repainting cells at even and odd indices separately. However, this approach might not always yield the optimal solution. For instance, consider the following input:

Input:
```
6 3
AAABBB
```

Expected Output:
```
3
AABABB
```

But the program will output:
```
2
AAABAB
```

In this case, the program fails to find the optimal solution because it only considers repainting cells at even and odd indices separately, which does not guarantee the minimum number of repaintings. The optimal solution requires repainting three cells: changing the second and fourth cells to 'B', and the sixth cell to 'A'. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of `k` distinct uppercase English letters. It processes this string in two passes to ensure no two consecutive characters in the resulting lists `ans1` and `ans2` are the same, where `ans1` is modified during the first pass and `ans2` during the second pass. For each position `i` in the string, if the current character is the same as its neighbor, it replaces the character with a different character from the first `k` uppercase English letters, ensuring it is not present in the neighbors. After processing both passes, it checks if `ans1` has fewer replacements than `ans2` and if `ans1` does not have any duplicates. If these conditions are met, it prints the count of replacements made in `ans1` followed by the modified string `ans1`. Otherwise, it prints the count of replacements made in `ans2` followed by the modified string `ans2`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
