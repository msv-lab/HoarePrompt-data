You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A colored stripe is represented by a horizontal row of n square cells, each cell is pained one of k colors. Your task is to repaint the minimum number of cells so that no two neighbouring cells are of the same color. You can use any color from 1 to k to repaint the cells.

Input

The first input line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105; 2 ≤ k ≤ 26). The second line contains n uppercase English letters. Letter "A" stands for the first color, letter "B" stands for the second color and so on. The first k English letters may be used. Each letter represents the color of the corresponding cell of the stripe.

Output

Print a single integer — the required minimum number of repaintings. In the second line print any possible variant of the repainted stripe.

        if i > 0 and s[i] == s[i - 1] or (i < n - 1 and s[i] == s[i + 1]):

            valid2 = False
            break
    if rec1 < rec2 and valid1 or not valid2:
        print(rec1)

        print(''.join(ans2))


```
Output hints: The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of `k` distinct uppercase English letters. It processes this string in two passes to ensure no two consecutive characters in the resulting lists `ans1` and `ans2` are the same, where `ans1` is modified during the first pass and `ans2` during the second pass. For each position `i` in the string, if the current character is the same as its neighbor, it replaces the character with a different character from the first `k` uppercase English letters, ensuring it is not present in the neighbors. After processing both passes, it checks if `ans1` has fewer replacements than `ans2` and if `ans1` does not have any duplicates. If these conditions are met, it prints the count of replacements made in `ans1` followed by the modified string `ans1`. Otherwise, it prints the count of replacements made in `ans2` followed by the modified string `ans2`.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
