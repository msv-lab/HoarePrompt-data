You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A colored stripe is represented by a horizontal row of n square cells, each cell is pained one of k colors. Your task is to repaint the minimum number of cells so that no two neighbouring cells are of the same color. You can use any color from 1 to k to repaint the cells.

Input

The first input line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105; 2 ≤ k ≤ 26). The second line contains n uppercase English letters. Letter "A" stands for the first color, letter "B" stands for the second color and so on. The first k English letters may be used. Each letter represents the color of the corresponding cell of the stripe.

Output

Print a single integer — the required minimum number of repaintings. In the second line print any possible variant of the repainted stripe.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem by only considering repainting cells at even and odd indices separately. However, this approach might not always yield the optimal solution. For instance, consider the following input:

Input:
```
6 3
AAABBB
```

Expected Output:
```
3
AABABB
```

But the program will output:
```
2
AAABAB
```

In this case, the program fails to find the optimal solution because it only considers repainting cells at even and odd indices separately, which does not guarantee the minimum number of repaintings. The optimal solution requires repainting three cells: changing the second and fourth cells to 'B', and the sixth cell to 'A'. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Otherwise, `rec2` is printed, and the string `''.join(ans2)` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of `k` distinct uppercase English letters. It processes this string in two passes to ensure no two consecutive characters in the resulting lists `ans1` and `ans2` are the same, where `ans1` is modified during the first pass and `ans2` during the second pass. For each position `i` in the string, if the current character is the same as its neighbor, it replaces the character with a different character from the first `k` uppercase English letters, ensuring it is not present in the neighbors. After processing both passes, it checks if `ans1` has fewer replacements than `ans2` and if `ans1` does not have any duplicates. If these conditions are met, it prints the count of replacements made in `ans1` followed by the modified string `ans1`. Otherwise, it prints the count of replacements made in `ans2` followed by the modified string `ans2`.
