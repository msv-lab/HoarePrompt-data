Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem by only considering repainting cells at even and odd indices separately. However, this approach might not always yield the optimal solution. For instance, consider the following input:

Input:
```
6 3
AAABBB
```

Expected Output:
```
3
AABABB
```

But the program will output:
```
2
AAABAB
```

In this case, the program fails to find the optimal solution because it only considers repainting cells at even and odd indices separately, which does not guarantee the minimum number of repaintings. The optimal solution requires repainting three cells: changing the second and fourth cells to 'B', and the sixth cell to 'A'. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
