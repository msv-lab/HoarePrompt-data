Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, this should be replaced with `input()`. However, more importantly, the program does not handle the case where the input text contains no words with capital letters correctly. For example, if the input text is "testtest", the program should output `0`, but it will output `0` as well, which seems correct at first glance. But consider the case where the input is an empty string or a string with only lowercase letters and spaces, such as "hello world". The program should output `0`, but it will still output `0`. This specific behavior is correct according to the problem description. However, another issue is that the program does not correctly handle the case where the input is a single uppercase letter or a word with all uppercase letters, like "HELLO" or "ABcDeFGH". In these cases, the program should output the length of the word, which is 5 for "HELLO". The current implementation always returns `0` in such cases. Therefore, the program does not correctly calculate the volume of the text in all cases, making it incorrect.
