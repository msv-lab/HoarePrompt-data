Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The first line (`raw_input()`) is skipped using `raw_input()`, which is not necessary as the problem description does not require reading an integer `n`. The second line is read using `raw_input().split()` which splits the input into a list of words.
   
2. **Volume Calculation**:
   - A variable `m` is initialized to 0. This variable is used to keep track of the maximum volume (number of uppercase letters) found in any word.
   - For each word `i` in the list `l`, a counter `s` is initialized to 0. This counter increments by 1 whenever a character `j` in the word is uppercase.
   - After counting the uppercase letters in the current word, `s` is compared with `m`, and `m` is updated if `s` is greater than the current value of `m`.
   
3. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the value of `m`, which is the maximum volume of any word in the text.

Given these points, the program correctly calculates the volume of the text as per the problem description. It handles the input as specified (single-space separated words of small and capital Latin letters), and it outputs the maximum number of uppercase letters in any word in the text.

Thus, the program is correct and will meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
