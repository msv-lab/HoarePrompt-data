Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two lines of input. The first line is ignored (though it should use `int(raw_input())` to read the length of the text), and the second line is split into a list of words using `raw_input().split()`. This matches the problem description where the second line contains single-space-separated words.

2. **Volume Calculation**: For each word in the list, the program counts the number of uppercase letters using `j.isupper()` and updates the maximum count (`m`) accordingly. This ensures that `m` holds the maximum volume (number of uppercase letters) among all words in the text.

3. **Output**: The program prints the value of `m`, which is the maximum volume of the text. This aligns with the problem description, where the output is the volume of the text.

4. **Assumptions**: The program makes no assumptions about invalid or unexpected input, as per the problem statement. It correctly handles the valid input scenario as specified.

Since the program accurately implements the logic required by the problem description without any discrepancies, it is correct.
