You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a text of single-space separated words, consisting of small and capital Latin letters.

Volume of the word is number of capital letters in the word. Volume of the text is maximum volume of all words in the text.

Calculate the volume of the given text.

Input

The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of the text.

The second line contains text of single-space separated words s1, s2, ..., si, consisting only of small and capital Latin letters.

Output

Print one integer number — volume of text.

Examples

Input

7
NonZERO


Output

5


Input

24
this is zero answer text


Output

0


Input

24
Harbour Space University


Output

1

Note

In the first example there is only one word, there are 5 capital letters in it.

In the second example all of the words contain 0 capital letters.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, and the second line of input contains a text of single-space separated words consisting only of small and capital Latin letters.
def func():
    raw_input()
    l = raw_input().split()
    m = 0
    for i in l:
        s = 0
        
        for j in i:
            if j.isupper():
                s += 1
        
        m = max(s, m)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `l` is a list of strings derived from the input line, `m` is the maximum count of uppercase characters found in any string within `l`.
    print(m)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two lines of input where the first line is ignored, the second line is a string of single-space separated words consisting of small and capital Latin letters. It then iterates through each word in the string, counts the number of uppercase letters in each word, and determines the maximum count among all words. Finally, it prints the maximum count of uppercase letters found in any word. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
