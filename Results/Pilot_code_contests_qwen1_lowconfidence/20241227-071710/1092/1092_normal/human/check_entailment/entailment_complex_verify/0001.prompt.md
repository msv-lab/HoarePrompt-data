You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a text of single-space separated words, consisting of small and capital Latin letters.

Volume of the word is number of capital letters in the word. Volume of the text is maximum volume of all words in the text.

Calculate the volume of the given text.

Input

The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of the text.

The second line contains text of single-space separated words s1, s2, ..., si, consisting only of small and capital Latin letters.

Output

Print one integer number — volume of text.

Examples

Input

7
NonZERO


Output

5


Input

24
this is zero answer text


Output

0


Input

24
Harbour Space University


Output

1

Note

In the first example there is only one word, there are 5 capital letters in it.

In the second example all of the words contain 0 capital letters.
Program:
```
def func():
    raw_input()
    l = raw_input().split()
    m = 0
    for i in l:
        s = 0
        for j in i:
            if j.isupper():
                s += 1
        m = max(s, m)
    print(m)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the volume of the text by iterating through each word, counting the number of uppercase letters in each word, and keeping track of the maximum count. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly processes the input, splits the text into words, counts the uppercase letters in each word, and finds the maximum volume among all words. The program works correctly for all given examples and does not miss any edge cases based on the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, and the second line of input contains a text of single-space separated words consisting only of small and capital Latin letters.
def func():
    raw_input()
    l = raw_input().split()
    m = 0
    for i in l:
        s = 0
        
        for j in i:
            if j.isupper():
                s += 1
        
        m = max(s, m)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `l` is a list of strings derived from the input line, `m` is the maximum count of uppercase characters found in any string within `l`.
    print(m)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two lines of input where the first line is ignored, the second line is a string of single-space separated words consisting of small and capital Latin letters. It then iterates through each word in the string, counts the number of uppercase letters in each word, and determines the maximum count among all words. Finally, it prints the maximum count of uppercase letters found in any word. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
