Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the input, processes each word to count the number of uppercase letters, and finds the maximum count among all words. The code handles all potential cases as described:

1. It reads the length of the text (though this value is not used in the current implementation).
2. It splits the input string into individual words.
3. For each word, it counts the number of uppercase letters.
4. It keeps track of the maximum count encountered.
5. Finally, it prints the maximum count.

Since the code follows the problem description accurately and handles all potential cases without any issues, the program is correct.
