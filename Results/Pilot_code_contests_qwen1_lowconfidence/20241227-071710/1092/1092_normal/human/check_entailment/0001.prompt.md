You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a text of single-space separated words, consisting of small and capital Latin letters.

Volume of the word is number of capital letters in the word. Volume of the text is maximum volume of all words in the text.

Calculate the volume of the given text.

Input

The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of the text.

The second line contains text of single-space separated words s1, s2, ..., si, consisting only of small and capital Latin letters.

Output

Print one integer number — volume of text.

Examples

Input

7
NonZERO


Output

5


Input

24
this is zero answer text


Output

0


Input

24
Harbour Space University


Output

1

Note

In the first example there is only one word, there are 5 capital letters in it.

In the second example all of the words contain 0 capital letters.
Program:
```
def func():
    raw_input()
    l = raw_input().split()
    m = 0
    for i in l:
        s = 0
        for j in i:
            if j.isupper():
                s += 1
        m = max(s, m)
    print(m)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
