The function reads two lines of input where the first line is ignored, the second line is a string of single-space separated words consisting of small and capital Latin letters. It then iterates through each word in the string, counts the number of uppercase letters in each word, and determines the maximum count among all words. Finally, it prints the maximum count of uppercase letters found in any word. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value.
