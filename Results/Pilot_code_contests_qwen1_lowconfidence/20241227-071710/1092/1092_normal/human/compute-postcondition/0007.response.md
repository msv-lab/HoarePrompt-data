`s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is 0, so now `s` is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list of strings derived from the input line, `m` is 0, `i` is a non-empty string, `s` is 1, and the current value of `j` is an uppercase character.
