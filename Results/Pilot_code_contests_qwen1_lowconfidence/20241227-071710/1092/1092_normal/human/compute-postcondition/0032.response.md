`s` is assigned the value 0. This initializes `s` to 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `l` is a list of strings derived from the input line, with at least two more strings to process, `i` is the next string from `l`, `s` is 0, `m` is the maximum of `s` and `m`**
