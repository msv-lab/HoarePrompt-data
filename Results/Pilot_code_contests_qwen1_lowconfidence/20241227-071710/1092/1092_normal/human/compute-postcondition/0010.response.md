`s` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `s` is 1, so after the increment, `s` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list of strings derived from the input line, `m` is 0, `i` is a non-empty string, `s` is 2, and the current value of `j` is the next character in the string `i`.**
