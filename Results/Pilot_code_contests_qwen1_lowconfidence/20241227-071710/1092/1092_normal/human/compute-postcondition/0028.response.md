Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `l` is a list of strings with at least one more string to process, `i` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than before), `j` is the first character of `i`, and `s` is either 2 or 3 if `j` is an uppercase character, otherwise `s` remains 0.***
