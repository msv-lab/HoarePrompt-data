`m` is assigned the maximum value between `s` and `m`. Since `s` is the count of uppercase characters in the string `i`, and `m` is initially 0, `m` will be updated to the value of `s` because `s` is greater than `m`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list of strings derived from the input line, `m` is the count of uppercase characters in the string `i`, `i` is a non-empty string, and `s` is the count of uppercase characters in the string `i`.**
