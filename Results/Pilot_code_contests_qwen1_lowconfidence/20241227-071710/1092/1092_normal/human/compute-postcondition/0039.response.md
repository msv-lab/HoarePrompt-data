Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `l` is a list of strings with at least one more string to process after `i`, `i` has at least one more character to process, `s` is 2, `m` is 0, `j` is the next character in the string `i` and it is uppercase if the condition `j.isupper()` is met.*** 

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided and the if part sets `s` to 2 regardless of whether `j.isupper()` is true or false, the overall postcondition remains as the state after the if condition is met.
