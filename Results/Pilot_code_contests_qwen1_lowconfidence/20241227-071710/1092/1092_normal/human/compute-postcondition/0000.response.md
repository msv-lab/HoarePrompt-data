The code `raw_input()` reads a line of input from the user, but it does not store this input in any variable. Therefore, the value of `n` remains unchanged, and the input line itself is not stored. The precondition that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200 is still valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200**
