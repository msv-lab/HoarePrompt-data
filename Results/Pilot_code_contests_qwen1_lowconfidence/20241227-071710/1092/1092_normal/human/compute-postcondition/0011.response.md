Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list of strings derived from the input line, `m` is 0, `i` is a non-empty string, `s` is 2, and the current value of `j` is the next character in the string `i`. If the current character `j` is uppercase, then `s` is set to 2; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
