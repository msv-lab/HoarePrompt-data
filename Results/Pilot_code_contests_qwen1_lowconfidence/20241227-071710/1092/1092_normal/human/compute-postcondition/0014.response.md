Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list of strings derived from the input line, `m` is 0, `i` is a non-empty string, and `s` is 3. If the current value of `j` (the next character in the string `i`) is an uppercase letter, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.***
