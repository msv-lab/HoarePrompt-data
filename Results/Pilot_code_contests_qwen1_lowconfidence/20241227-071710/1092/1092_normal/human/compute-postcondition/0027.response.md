`s` is incremented by 1. The value of `s` can be either 1 or 2 depending on the initial condition. If `j` was an uppercase string, `s` was initially set to 2; otherwise, `s` was initially 0. In either case, incrementing `s` by 1 means `s` will now be 2 if it was initially 1, or 3 if it was initially 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `l` is a list of strings with at least one more string to process, `i` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than before), `j` is the first character of `i`, `s` is either 2 or 3**
