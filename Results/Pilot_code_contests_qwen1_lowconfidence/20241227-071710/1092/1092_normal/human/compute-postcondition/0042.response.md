Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `l` is a list of strings with at least one more string to process after `i`, `i` has at least one more character to process, `s` is 3, `m` is 0, `j` is the next character in the string `i` and it is either upper or lower case. This means that if `j` is an uppercase character, `s` is set to 3. If `j` is not an uppercase character (which is not specified in the if part), `s` remains 2.***
