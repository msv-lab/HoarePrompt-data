Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `l` is a list of strings with at least one more string to process after `i`, `i` is a non-empty string, `s` is 1, `m` is 0, `j` is a substring of `i` and it is uppercase if the condition `j.isupper()` is met. Otherwise, the values of `s` and `m` remain unchanged.***
