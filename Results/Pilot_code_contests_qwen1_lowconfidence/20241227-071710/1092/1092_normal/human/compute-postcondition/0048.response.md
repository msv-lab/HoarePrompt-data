Functionality: **The function reads two lines of input where the first line is ignored, the second line is a string of single-space separated words consisting of small and capital Latin letters. It then iterates through each word in the string, counts the number of uppercase letters in each word, and determines the maximum count among all words. Finally, it prints the maximum count of uppercase letters found in any word. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the second line of input is empty or consists only of spaces, the function will still iterate through the string, but since there are no words, the maximum count of uppercase letters will be 0.
- If none of the words contain any uppercase letters, the maximum count will also be 0.
- The function assumes that the input string contains valid words (i.e., separated by single spaces and consisting only of Latin letters). If the input does not meet these criteria, the function will still process the input but may produce unexpected results.
