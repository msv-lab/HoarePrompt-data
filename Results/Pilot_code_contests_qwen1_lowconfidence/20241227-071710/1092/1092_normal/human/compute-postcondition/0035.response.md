`s` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `s` is 0, so the new value of `s` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `l` is a list of strings with at least one more string to process after `i`, `i` is a non-empty string, `s` is 1, `m` is 0, `j` is a substring of `i` and it is uppercase**
