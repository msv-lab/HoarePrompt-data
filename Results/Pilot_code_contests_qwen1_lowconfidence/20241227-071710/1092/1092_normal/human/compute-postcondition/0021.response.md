`s` is incremented by 1. The value of `s` was initially 0, so now it is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `l` is a list of strings derived from the input line, with at least one more string to process, `i` must be a non-empty string, `s` is 1, the current value of `j` is an uppercase string.
