`s` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `l` is a list of strings with at least one more string to process after `i`, `i` has at least one more character to process, `s` is 3, `m` is 0, `j` is the next character in the string `i` and it is either upper or lower case.**
