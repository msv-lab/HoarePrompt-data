The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The parameter constraints and relationships state that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, and the second line of input contains a text of single-space separated words consisting only of small and capital Latin letters.

Based on the given output cases, the function processes an integer `n` and a string of words. However, since the function definition itself does not include any parameters, we need to consider the input context outside the function's scope.

Given the structure, the function likely reads from some external input (e.g., standard input), processes `n` and the string of words, and returns a value based on certain conditions.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and processes an integer `n` and a string of words, returning a value based on certain conditions.**
