The code `l = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings. The original value of `n` (which is an integer between 1 and 200) is not used in this operation, so its value remains unchanged. The input line is split into a list, which is assigned to `l`.

Since the exact input is not specified, `l` will contain a list of strings derived from the input line.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; `l` is a list of strings derived from the input line**
