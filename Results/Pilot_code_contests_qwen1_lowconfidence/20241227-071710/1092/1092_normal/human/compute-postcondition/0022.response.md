Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `l` is a list of strings derived from the input line, with at least one more string to process, `i` must be a non-empty string. If the current value of `j` is an uppercase string, `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` remains 0.***
