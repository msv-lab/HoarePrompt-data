To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the structure of the for loop.

### Given Information:
- `total` is 0
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\)
- `l` is a list of strings derived from the input line, with at least one more string to process
- `i` is the next string in the list `l`
- `s` is 0

### For Loop Structure:
```
for j in i:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `i`.
2. **Variables Involved**: The loop involves the variable `j`, which represents each character in the string `i`.

### Required Adjustments:
- Since the loop iterates over the characters in the string `i`, the string `i` itself must be non-empty (i.e., it must contain at least one character).
- The other variables (`total`, `n`, `l`, and `s`) are not directly involved in the loop condition or its execution, so they don't need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that the string `i` must be non-empty.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `l` is a list of strings derived from the input line, with at least one more string to process, `i` must be a non-empty string, `s` is 0**
