`s` is assigned the value `0`. The initial value of `s` was the count of uppercase characters in the next string `i`, but now it is reset to `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list of strings derived from the input line, with at least one more string to process, `i` is the next string in the list `l`, `s` is 0**
