`s` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, `l` remains a list of strings derived from the input line, `m` remains `0`, and `i` remains the first element in the list `l`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list of strings derived from the input line, `m` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list `l`, `s` is 0**
