Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list of strings derived from the input line, `m` is 0, `i` is a non-empty string, `s` is 1, and the current value of `j` is an uppercase character.** 

Explanation: Since there is no else part, the postcondition for the entire if-else block remains the same as the postcondition for the if part. The value of `s` is set to 1 if `j` is an uppercase character, and this state is maintained regardless of whether the if condition is true or false.
