`s` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `s` is the original value plus 1. The value of `n`, `l`, `i`, `m`, `j`, and `total` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `l` is a list of strings with at least one more string to process after `i`, `i` has at least one more character to process, `s` is `1 + 1 = 2`, `m` is 0, `j` is the next character in the string `i` and it is uppercase if the condition `j.isupper()` is met.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `l` is a list of strings with at least one more string to process after `i`, `i` has at least one more character to process, `s` is 2, `m` is 0, `j` is the next character in the string `i` and it is uppercase if the condition `j.isupper()` is met.**
