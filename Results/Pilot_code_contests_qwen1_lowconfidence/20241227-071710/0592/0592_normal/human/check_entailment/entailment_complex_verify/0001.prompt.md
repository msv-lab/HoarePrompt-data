You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Students in a class are making towers of blocks. Each student makes a (non-zero) tower by stacking pieces lengthwise on top of each other. n of the students use pieces made of two blocks and m of the students use pieces made of three blocks.

The students don’t want to use too many blocks, but they also want to be unique, so no two students’ towers may contain the same number of blocks. Find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers.

Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000, n + m > 0) — the number of students using two-block pieces and the number of students using three-block pieces, respectively.

Output

Print a single integer, denoting the minimum possible height of the tallest tower.

Examples

Input

1 3


Output

9

Input

5 0


Output

10

Note

In the first case, the student using two-block pieces can make a tower of height 4, and the students using three-block pieces can make towers of height 3, 6, and 9 blocks. The tallest tower has a height of 9 blocks.

In the second case, the students can make towers of heights 2, 4, and 8 with two-block pieces and towers of heights 3 and 6 with three-block pieces, for a maximum height of 8 blocks.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the logic required to solve the problem correctly. Specifically, the code does not handle the calculation of the minimum height of the tallest tower for the given constraints.

The problem requires finding the smallest height such that both \( n \) students using two-block pieces and \( m \) students using three-block pieces can have unique tower heights. The code, however, does not attempt to calculate this value. Instead, it defines several unnecessary functions and tries to read input in a way that is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

A correct approach would involve finding the smallest integer \( h \) such that we can assign unique tower heights to all students using either 2 or 3 blocks. This can be achieved by finding the smallest number that can accommodate \( n \) towers of 2-block pieces and \( m \) towers of 3-block pieces without repetition.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def main():
    n, m = map(int, input().strip().split())
    i = 1
    while True:
        # Check if we can fit n towers of 2-block pieces and m towers of 3-block pieces
        if i // 2 >= n and i // 3 >= m and (i // 2 + i // 3 - i // 6) >= (n + m):
            break
        i += 1
    print(i)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code iteratively checks each possible height `i` until it finds the smallest height that satisfies the conditions. It ensures that there are enough unique tower heights for both types of blocks.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables (n, m) are explicitly declared or passed as arguments to the function. However, n and m represent non-negative integers such that 0 <= n, m <= 1,000,000 and n + m > 0.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input provided by the user, given that 0 <= n, m <= 1,000,000 and n + m > 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer input from the user and returns it. The input must satisfy the conditions \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\). If the input does not meet these conditions, the behavior of the function is undefined since the code does not handle such cases. There is no validation in the code to ensure the input meets the specified constraints.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters and it is expected to read input from the standard input, which should be in the format of two space-separated integers n and m, representing the number of students using two-block pieces and the number of students using three-block pieces, respectively.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program reads two space-separated integers n and m, representing the number of students using two-block pieces and the number of students using three-block pieces, respectively, and returns them as input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` reads two space-separated integers `n` and `m` from the standard input, where `n` represents the number of students using two-block pieces and `m` represents the number of students using three-block pieces. It then returns these integers as the output. There are no parameters passed to the function, and it assumes that the input is correctly formatted. Potential edge cases include incorrect formatting (e.g., more or fewer than two integers separated by spaces) or non-integer inputs, which would cause the program to behave unpredictably. If such edge cases occur, the function does not handle them and may lead to errors.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_3()` are defined within its signature. The function reads input from the standard input, which consists of a single line containing two space-separated integers n and m, where 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000 and n + m > 0.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object containing two integers n and m, where n and m are space-separated from the input and satisfy 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000 and n + m > 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` reads two space-separated integers `n` and `m` from standard input, where `0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000` and `n + m > 0`. It then returns a map object containing these integers. The function handles the case where the input does not consist of exactly two space-separated integers by raising a ValueError. There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters. It reads input from stdin which consists of a single line containing two space-separated integers n and m.
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object that contains strings of the two integers inputted, separated by a space
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads two space-separated integers from standard input (stdin) and returns a map object containing these integers as strings, separated by a space. There are no parameters passed to the function. The function does not perform any additional operations on the integers once they are read.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are provided in the given code snippet. However, based on the problem description and the context, we can infer that the function `func_3()` returns some value or values which are then processed by `func_5()`. Since no specific variables are mentioned in the function signature, we can't provide specific variable descriptions.
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list generated by func_3()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5()` takes no parameters and returns a list generated by calling `func_3()`. After executing, the program will have returned a list of elements that were produced by `func_3()`. If `func_3()` returns an empty list, `func_5()` will also return an empty list. There are no specified edge cases or missing functionality within the provided code, so it is assumed that `func_3()` operates correctly as intended.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no information about the variables in the function signature for this program. The function does not take any parameters and thus, it does not define any variables in its signature related to the problem description.
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
    threading.stack_size(40960000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and thread stack size to very high values, then starts a new thread to run the `main` function. The function itself does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After executing, the program will have started a new thread running the `main` function with the specified settings. This setup is intended to handle potentially deep recursion and large stack usage. However, if the `main` function is not defined elsewhere in the codebase, this setup would lead to a `NameError`. Additionally, setting such high limits can consume significant system resources and may cause issues if not managed properly.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: item is a tuple or list containing at least one element, where the second element is an integer representing the height of a tower.
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
    #The program returns the integer representing the height of a tower from the second element of tuple or list 'item'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a single parameter `item`, which is expected to be a tuple or list containing at least one element, where the second element is an integer representing the height of a tower. The function returns the integer value of the second element in `item`. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities noted in the provided code; the function always returns the integer at index 1 of the input `item` if it exists and is an integer. If `item` does not have at least two elements or the second element is not an integer, the behavior is undefined based on the current code structure.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers representing the heights of the towers that can be built by the students. The heights are determined by the number of block pieces each student uses (either 2 or 3 blocks per piece), and the list is generated based on the values of n and m from the input.
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the values determined by the getKey function applied to each element in list 'l'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` of integers representing tower heights. It returns a new list where the elements are sorted in descending order based on the values determined by the `getKey` function applied to each element in `l`. The function performs no modifications to the original list `l`; instead, it creates and returns a sorted copy of `l`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it is assumed that `l` can be an empty list, in which case the returned list will also be empty.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that 0 <= n, m <= 1,000,000 and n + m > 0, and num is an integer representing the number of blocks per piece.
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #[[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a two-dimensional list with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element in the list is the integer `num`. This means that the function creates a matrix (or grid) filled entirely with the value `num`. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function handles the case where both `n` and `m` are positive integers. The function does not perform any validation on the inputs; it assumes that `n` and `m` are non-negative integers greater than zero, and `num` is an integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the caller will have a two-dimensional list object, which is a perfect square matrix if `n == m`, or a rectangular matrix otherwise, filled with the value `num`.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer.
def func_10(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns True if x is 0, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts a non-negative integer `x`. It returns `True` if `x` is 0, otherwise it returns `False`. The function correctly handles the case where `x` is 0 and returns `True`, and for any other non-negative integer, it returns `False`. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 1 000 000.
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns the binary representation of the integer `n` without the '0b' prefix
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `n` within the range \(0 \leq n \leq 1,000,000\) and returns its binary representation as a string without the '0b' prefix. The function converts the integer `n` to its binary form using the built-in `bin()` function, which includes the '0b' prefix. It then removes this prefix by replacing it with an empty string. The function handles all integers within the specified range correctly and does not require any additional edge case handling since the `bin()` function itself already ensures that the input is a valid non-negative integer.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 1 000 000.
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by converting each digit of the non-negative integer n (where 0 <= n <= 1000000) into individual integer elements
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts a non-negative integer `n` within the range from 0 to 1,000,000. It converts `n` into a string, iterates over each character in the string representation, converts each character back into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. This means that if `n` is 12345, the function will return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The function handles edge cases where `n` could be 0 (returning `[0]`) or the maximum value of 1,000,000 (returning `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`). The function does not perform any additional actions beyond converting the integer into a list of its digits.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= n.
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))
    #`The program returns the value of factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r` such that `0 <= r <= n`. It calculates and returns the binomial coefficient, which is the number of ways to choose `r` elements from a set of `n` elements without regard to the order of selection. This is mathematically represented as `C(n, r) = factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))`. The function assumes that the `factorial` function is correctly implemented and available in the environment where `func_13` is called. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it is important to note that the function relies on the `factorial` function to handle large values appropriately to avoid overflow. If `n` or `r` are negative, or if `r` is greater than `n`, the function would not be valid according to the problem statement, but these edge cases are not handled within the function itself.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers such that y != 0 and x >= 0.
def func_14(x, y):
    if (x % y == 0) :
        return x // y
        #`The program returns x divided by y using integer division`
    else :
        return x // y + 1
        #`The program returns (x // y) + 1 where x and y are non-negative integers such that y is not zero and x is greater than or equal to zero, and the remainder of x divided by y is not zero`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y` (with `y` not being zero) and returns the integer division of `x` by `y`. If the remainder of `x` divided by `y` is zero, it returns `x // y`. If the remainder is not zero, it returns `(x // y) + 1`. This covers all possible outcomes based on the value of the remainder when `x` is divided by `y`.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers, and p is a positive integer.
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is \( x^{y_{\text{binary}}} \mod p \), and `res` is the product of \( x \) raised to the power of each set bit in `y`'s binary representation, modulo \( p \)
    return res
    #The program returns res, which is the product of \( x \) raised to the power of each set bit in `y`'s binary representation, modulo \( p \)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are non-negative integers and `p` is a positive integer. It calculates the result of raising `x` to the power of each set bit in `y`'s binary representation, then takes the result modulo `p`. The function uses a loop to iteratively square `x` and reduce `y` by considering its binary representation, updating `res` accordingly. If `y` is odd, it multiplies `x` into `res` before squaring `x`. After the loop, the function returns `res`.

The function handles the following cases:
- If `y` is zero, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains 1 (since \(x^0 \equiv 1 \mod p\)).
- If `x` is 1, the function returns 1 regardless of `y` and `p` (since \(1^n \equiv 1 \mod p\)).
- If `p` is 1, the function always returns 0 (since any number modulo 1 is 0).

There is no explicit handling for negative values of `x` or `y`, so the function assumes non-negative inputs. The function correctly implements the intended behavior as described by the annotations and the return postconditions.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers.
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0.
    return x
    #The program returns x which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y, and y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function returns `x`, which is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and sets `y` to 0. This process handles all potential edge cases where both `x` and `y` are positive integers, including when one of them is initially 0. In such a case, the GCD would be the non-zero number, and `y` would be set to 0.

#Function 17:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than 1.
def func_17(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is a positive integer greater than 1
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 4
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and greater than or equal to 4, and `n` is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and greater than or equal to 4, and `n` is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3, `i` is increased by 6 with each iteration, and for all integers `i` in the range \(2 \leq i \leq \sqrt{n}\), neither `n % i` nor `n % (i + 2)` equals 0. If the loop completes without returning `False`, `n` is not divisible by any number of the form `i` or `i + 2` where `i` starts at 5 and increases by 6 in each iteration.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that `n` is not divisible by any number of the form `i` or `i + 2` where `i` starts at 5 and increases by 6 in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_17` accepts a positive integer `n` greater than 1 and returns `False` in most cases. Specifically, it returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, or if `n` is divisible by any number of the form `i` or `i + 2` where `i` starts at 5 and increases by 6 in each iteration. It returns `True` only if `n` passes all these checks, indicating that `n` is a prime number greater than 3 and not divisible by 2, 3, or any number of the form `i` or `i + 2` up to the square root of `n`.

#Function 18:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no information provided about the variables in the function signature for `func_18`. The function does not take any parameters. However, it opens input and output files for reading from 'input.txt' and writing to 'output.txt', respectively.
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_18` opens two files, `input.txt` for reading and `output.txt` for writing, and redirects the standard input and output streams to these files. This means that any input read using `sys.stdin` will come from `input.txt`, and any output written using `sys.stdout` will go to `output.txt`. This redirection remains in effect until the program terminates or the file objects are closed. If the files do not exist, an exception will be raised.

#Function 19:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that 0 <= n, m <= 1000000 and n + m > 0.
def func_19():
    n, m = func_3()
    for i in range(1, 1000001):
        if n <= i // 2 and m <= i // 3 and n + m <= i // 2 + i // 2 - i // 6:
            func_20(i)
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `m` are both 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing (None). It iterates through numbers from 1 to 1,000,000 and checks if `n` and `m` satisfy specific conditions: `n <= i // 2`, `m <= i // 3`, and `n + m <= i // 2 + i // 2 - i // 6`. If these conditions are met, it calls `func_20(i)` and breaks out of the loop. After the loop completes, `n` and `m` are guaranteed to be 0. This function essentially finds the smallest integer `i` within the given range where the conditions on `n` and `m` hold true, and performs an action (`func_20(i)`) on that integer. If no such `i` is found within the range, `n` and `m` remain 0.

#Function 20:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_20` does not contribute directly to solving the problem described. It takes a variable number of arguments and prints them with a specified separator and file, but there are no variables related to the problem's input or output in its signature.
def func_20():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `func_20` is defined, `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the last element in `args` processed by the loop, and the concatenated string of `args` elements separated by `sep` has been written to `file`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`func_20` is defined, `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the last element in `args` processed by the loop, the concatenated string of `args` elements separated by `sep` has been written to `file`, and the value `\n` has been written to `file`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, then `file.flush()` is called.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. It takes a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and prints them to a specified file with a given separator (`sep`). By default, the separator is a space character and the file is `sys.stdout`. After printing the arguments, it writes an end character (defaulting to a newline) and flushes the file buffer if requested. However, the function does not modify any external variables or state outside of its scope. There is no input or output associated with the function itself; it only prints to the specified file.
