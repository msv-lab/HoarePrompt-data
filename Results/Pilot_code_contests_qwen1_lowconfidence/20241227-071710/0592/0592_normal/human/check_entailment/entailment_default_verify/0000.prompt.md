You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Students in a class are making towers of blocks. Each student makes a (non-zero) tower by stacking pieces lengthwise on top of each other. n of the students use pieces made of two blocks and m of the students use pieces made of three blocks.

The students don’t want to use too many blocks, but they also want to be unique, so no two students’ towers may contain the same number of blocks. Find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers.

Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000, n + m > 0) — the number of students using two-block pieces and the number of students using three-block pieces, respectively.

Output

Print a single integer, denoting the minimum possible height of the tallest tower.

Examples

Input

1 3


Output

9


Input

3 2


Output

8


Input

5 0


Output

10

Note

In the first case, the student using two-block pieces can make a tower of height 4, and the students using three-block pieces can make towers of height 3, 6, and 9 blocks. The tallest tower has a height of 9 blocks.

In the second case, the students can make towers of heights 2, 4, and 8 with two-block pieces and towers of heights 3 and 6 with three-block pieces, for a maximum height of 8 blocks.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the functions defined in the program do not compute the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers as required. Instead, the functions seem to be utility functions or placeholders without being integrated into a solution that addresses the problem statement.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimum number of blocks such that the number of towers formed with two-block pieces and three-block pieces are unique. This involves finding the smallest integer `i` such that the sum of unique counts of towers from two-block pieces and three-block pieces is at least `n + m`.

A correct approach would involve:
1. Incrementing the height until the condition is met.
2. Ensuring the number of unique towers (from both two-block and three-block pieces) is sufficient.

Here's a simplified version of how the solution could look:

```python
def min_tower_height(n, m):
    i = 0
    while n + m > sum(range(1, i + 1)):
        i += 1
    return i * 3  # Since the maximum increment comes from the three-block pieces

n, m = map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
print(min_tower_height(n, m))
```

This code correctly calculates the minimum height necessary for the tallest tower by ensuring the number of unique towers is sufficient. The current program does not contain such logic, hence it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 20 : The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. It takes a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and prints them to a specified file with a given separator (`sep`). By default, the separator is a space character and the file is `sys.stdout`. After printing the arguments, it writes an end character (defaulting to a newline) and flushes the file buffer if requested. However, the function does not modify any external variables or state outside of its scope. There is no input or output associated with the function itself; it only prints to the specified file.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
