You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Students in a class are making towers of blocks. Each student makes a (non-zero) tower by stacking pieces lengthwise on top of each other. n of the students use pieces made of two blocks and m of the students use pieces made of three blocks.

The students don’t want to use too many blocks, but they also want to be unique, so no two students’ towers may contain the same number of blocks. Find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers.

Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000, n + m > 0) — the number of students using two-block pieces and the number of students using three-block pieces, respectively.

Output

Print a single integer, denoting the minimum possible height of the tallest tower.

Examples

Input

1 3


Output

9


Input

3 2


Output

8


Input

5 0


Output

10

Note

In the first case, the student using two-block pieces can make a tower of height 4, and the students using three-block pieces can make towers of height 3, 6, and 9 blocks. The tallest tower has a height of 9 blocks.

In the second case, the students can make towers of heights 2, 4, and 8 with two-block pieces and towers of heights 3 and 6 with three-block pieces, for a maximum height of 8 blocks.

    func_19()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` reads an integer input from the user and returns it. The input must satisfy the conditions \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\). If the input does not meet these conditions, the behavior of the function is undefined since the code does not handle such cases. There is no validation in the code to ensure the input meets the specified constraints.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2()` reads two space-separated integers `n` and `m` from the standard input, where `n` represents the number of students using two-block pieces and `m` represents the number of students using three-block pieces. It then returns these integers as the output. There are no parameters passed to the function, and it assumes that the input is correctly formatted. Potential edge cases include incorrect formatting (e.g., more or fewer than two integers separated by spaces) or non-integer inputs, which would cause the program to behave unpredictably. If such edge cases occur, the function does not handle them and may lead to errors.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3()` reads two space-separated integers `n` and `m` from standard input, where `0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000` and `n + m > 0`. It then returns a map object containing these integers. The function handles the case where the input does not consist of exactly two space-separated integers by raising a ValueError. There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` reads two space-separated integers from standard input (stdin) and returns a map object containing these integers as strings, separated by a space. There are no parameters passed to the function. The function does not perform any additional operations on the integers once they are read.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5()` takes no parameters and returns a list generated by calling `func_3()`. After executing, the program will have returned a list of elements that were produced by `func_3()`. If `func_3()` returns an empty list, `func_5()` will also return an empty list. There are no specified edge cases or missing functionality within the provided code, so it is assumed that `func_3()` operates correctly as intended.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
    threading.stack_size(40960000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and thread stack size to very high values, then starts a new thread to run the `main` function. The function itself does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After executing, the program will have started a new thread running the `main` function with the specified settings. This setup is intended to handle potentially deep recursion and large stack usage. However, if the `main` function is not defined elsewhere in the codebase, this setup would lead to a `NameError`. Additionally, setting such high limits can consume significant system resources and may cause issues if not managed properly.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts a single parameter `item`, which is expected to be a tuple or list containing at least one element, where the second element is an integer representing the height of a tower. The function returns the integer value of the second element in `item`. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities noted in the provided code; the function always returns the integer at index 1 of the input `item` if it exists and is an integer. If `item` does not have at least two elements or the second element is not an integer, the behavior is undefined based on the current code structure.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` of integers representing tower heights. It returns a new list where the elements are sorted in descending order based on the values determined by the `getKey` function applied to each element in `l`. The function performs no modifications to the original list `l`; instead, it creates and returns a sorted copy of `l`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it is assumed that `l` can be an empty list, in which case the returned list will also be empty.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a two-dimensional list with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element in the list is the integer `num`. This means that the function creates a matrix (or grid) filled entirely with the value `num`. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function handles the case where both `n` and `m` are positive integers. The function does not perform any validation on the inputs; it assumes that `n` and `m` are non-negative integers greater than zero, and `num` is an integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the caller will have a two-dimensional list object, which is a perfect square matrix if `n == m`, or a rectangular matrix otherwise, filled with the value `num`.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts a non-negative integer `x`. It returns `True` if `x` is 0, otherwise it returns `False`. The function correctly handles the case where `x` is 0 and returns `True`, and for any other non-negative integer, it returns `False`. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `n` within the range \(0 \leq n \leq 1,000,000\) and returns its binary representation as a string without the '0b' prefix. The function converts the integer `n` to its binary form using the built-in `bin()` function, which includes the '0b' prefix. It then removes this prefix by replacing it with an empty string. The function handles all integers within the specified range correctly and does not require any additional edge case handling since the `bin()` function itself already ensures that the input is a valid non-negative integer.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts a non-negative integer `n` within the range from 0 to 1,000,000. It converts `n` into a string, iterates over each character in the string representation, converts each character back into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. This means that if `n` is 12345, the function will return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The function handles edge cases where `n` could be 0 (returning `[0]`) or the maximum value of 1,000,000 (returning `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`). The function does not perform any additional actions beyond converting the integer into a list of its digits.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r` such that `0 <= r <= n`. It calculates and returns the binomial coefficient, which is the number of ways to choose `r` elements from a set of `n` elements without regard to the order of selection. This is mathematically represented as `C(n, r) = factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))`. The function assumes that the `factorial` function is correctly implemented and available in the environment where `func_13` is called. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it is important to note that the function relies on the `factorial` function to handle large values appropriately to avoid overflow. If `n` or `r` are negative, or if `r` is greater than `n`, the function would not be valid according to the problem statement, but these edge cases are not handled within the function itself.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y):
    if x % y == 0:
        return x // y
    else:
        return x // y + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y` (with `y` not being zero) and returns the integer division of `x` by `y`. If the remainder of `x` divided by `y` is zero, it returns `x // y`. If the remainder is not zero, it returns `(x // y) + 1`. This covers all possible outcomes based on the value of the remainder when `x` is divided by `y`.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p
    return res
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are non-negative integers and `p` is a positive integer. It calculates the result of raising `x` to the power of each set bit in `y`'s binary representation, then takes the result modulo `p`. The function uses a loop to iteratively square `x` and reduce `y` by considering its binary representation, updating `res` accordingly. If `y` is odd, it multiplies `x` into `res` before squaring `x`. After the loop, the function returns `res`.

The function handles the following cases:
- If `y` is zero, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains 1 (since \(x^0 \equiv 1 \mod p\)).
- If `x` is 1, the function returns 1 regardless of `y` and `p` (since \(1^n \equiv 1 \mod p\)).
- If `p` is 1, the function always returns 0 (since any number modulo 1 is 0).

There is no explicit handling for negative values of `x` or `y`, so the function assumes non-negative inputs. The function correctly implements the intended behavior as described by the annotations and the return postconditions.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function returns `x`, which is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and sets `y` to 0. This process handles all potential edge cases where both `x` and `y` are positive integers, including when one of them is initially 0. In such a case, the GCD would be the non-zero number, and `y` would be set to 0.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function17:  The function `func_17` accepts a positive integer `n` greater than 1 and returns `False` in most cases. Specifically, it returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, or if `n` is divisible by any number of the form `i` or `i + 2` where `i` starts at 5 and increases by 6 in each iteration. It returns `True` only if `n` passes all these checks, indicating that `n` is a prime number greater than 3 and not divisible by 2, 3, or any number of the form `i` or `i + 2` up to the square root of `n`.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output hints for function18:  The function `func_18` opens two files, `input.txt` for reading and `output.txt` for writing, and redirects the standard input and output streams to these files. This means that any input read using `sys.stdin` will come from `input.txt`, and any output written using `sys.stdout` will go to `output.txt`. This redirection remains in effect until the program terminates or the file objects are closed. If the files do not exist, an exception will be raised.
Function number 19 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_19():
    (n, m) = func_3()
    for i in range(1, 1000001):
        if n <= i // 2 and m <= i // 3 and (n + m <= i // 2 + i // 2 - i // 6):
            func_20(i)
            break
''' 

 Output hints for function19:  The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing (None). It iterates through numbers from 1 to 1,000,000 and checks if `n` and `m` satisfy specific conditions: `n <= i // 2`, `m <= i // 3`, and `n + m <= i // 2 + i // 2 - i // 6`. If these conditions are met, it calls `func_20(i)` and breaks out of the loop. After the loop completes, `n` and `m` are guaranteed to be 0. This function essentially finds the smallest integer `i` within the given range where the conditions on `n` and `m` hold true, and performs an action (`func_20(i)`) on that integer. If no such `i` is found within the range, `n` and `m` remain 0.
Function number 20 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_20(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""

        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
''' 

 Output hints for function20:  The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. It takes a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and prints them to a specified file with a given separator (`sep`). By default, the separator is a space character and the file is `sys.stdout`. After printing the arguments, it writes an end character (defaulting to a newline) and flushes the file buffer if requested. However, the function does not modify any external variables or state outside of its scope. There is no input or output associated with the function itself; it only prints to the specified file.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
