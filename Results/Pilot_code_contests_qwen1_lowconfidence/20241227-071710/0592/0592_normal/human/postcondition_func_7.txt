The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` of integers representing tower heights. It returns a new list where the elements are sorted in descending order based on the values determined by the `getKey` function applied to each element in `l`. The function performs no modifications to the original list `l`; instead, it creates and returns a sorted copy of `l`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it is assumed that `l` can be an empty list, in which case the returned list will also be empty.
