The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r` such that `0 <= r <= n`. It calculates and returns the binomial coefficient, which is the number of ways to choose `r` elements from a set of `n` elements without regard to the order of selection. This is mathematically represented as `C(n, r) = factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))`. The function assumes that the `factorial` function is correctly implemented and available in the environment where `func_13` is called. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it is important to note that the function relies on the `factorial` function to handle large values appropriately to avoid overflow. If `n` or `r` are negative, or if `r` is greater than `n`, the function would not be valid according to the problem statement, but these edge cases are not handled within the function itself.
