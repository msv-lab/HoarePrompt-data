The function `func_16` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function returns `x`, which is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and sets `y` to 0. This process handles all potential edge cases where both `x` and `y` are positive integers, including when one of them is initially 0. In such a case, the GCD would be the non-zero number, and `y` would be set to 0.
