The function `func_14` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y` (with `y` not being zero) and returns the integer division of `x` by `y`. If the remainder of `x` divided by `y` is zero, it returns `x // y`. If the remainder is not zero, it returns `(x // y) + 1`. This covers all possible outcomes based on the value of the remainder when `x` is divided by `y`.
