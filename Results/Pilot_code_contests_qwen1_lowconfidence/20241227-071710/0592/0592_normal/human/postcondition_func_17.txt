The function `func_18` opens two files, `input.txt` for reading and `output.txt` for writing, and redirects the standard input and output streams to these files. This means that any input read using `sys.stdin` will come from `input.txt`, and any output written using `sys.stdout` will go to `output.txt`. This redirection remains in effect until the program terminates or the file objects are closed. If the files do not exist, an exception will be raised.
