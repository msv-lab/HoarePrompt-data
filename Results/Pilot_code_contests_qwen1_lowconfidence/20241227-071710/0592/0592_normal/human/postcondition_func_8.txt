The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a two-dimensional list with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element in the list is the integer `num`. This means that the function creates a matrix (or grid) filled entirely with the value `num`. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function handles the case where both `n` and `m` are positive integers. The function does not perform any validation on the inputs; it assumes that `n` and `m` are non-negative integers greater than zero, and `num` is an integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the caller will have a two-dimensional list object, which is a perfect square matrix if `n == m`, or a rectangular matrix otherwise, filled with the value `num`.
