The function `func_12` accepts a non-negative integer `n` within the range from 0 to 1,000,000. It converts `n` into a string, iterates over each character in the string representation, converts each character back into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. This means that if `n` is 12345, the function will return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The function handles edge cases where `n` could be 0 (returning `[0]`) or the maximum value of 1,000,000 (returning `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`). The function does not perform any additional actions beyond converting the integer into a list of its digits.
