The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `n` within the range \(0 \leq n \leq 1,000,000\) and returns its binary representation as a string without the '0b' prefix. The function converts the integer `n` to its binary form using the built-in `bin()` function, which includes the '0b' prefix. It then removes this prefix by replacing it with an empty string. The function handles all integers within the specified range correctly and does not require any additional edge case handling since the `bin()` function itself already ensures that the input is a valid non-negative integer.
