The function `func_1` reads an integer input from the user and returns it. The input must satisfy the conditions \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\). If the input does not meet these conditions, the behavior of the function is undefined since the code does not handle such cases. There is no validation in the code to ensure the input meets the specified constraints.
