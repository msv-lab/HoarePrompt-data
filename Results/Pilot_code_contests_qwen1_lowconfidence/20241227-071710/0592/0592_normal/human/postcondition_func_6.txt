The function `func_7` accepts a single parameter `item`, which is expected to be a tuple or list containing at least one element, where the second element is an integer representing the height of a tower. The function returns the integer value of the second element in `item`. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities noted in the provided code; the function always returns the integer at index 1 of the input `item` if it exists and is an integer. If `item` does not have at least two elements or the second element is not an integer, the behavior is undefined based on the current code structure.
