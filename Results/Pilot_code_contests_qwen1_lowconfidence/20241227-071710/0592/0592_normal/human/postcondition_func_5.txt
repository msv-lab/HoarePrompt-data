The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and thread stack size to very high values, then starts a new thread to run the `main` function. The function itself does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After executing, the program will have started a new thread running the `main` function with the specified settings. This setup is intended to handle potentially deep recursion and large stack usage. However, if the `main` function is not defined elsewhere in the codebase, this setup would lead to a `NameError`. Additionally, setting such high limits can consume significant system resources and may cause issues if not managed properly.
