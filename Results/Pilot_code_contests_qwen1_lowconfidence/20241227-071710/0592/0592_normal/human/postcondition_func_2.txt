The function `func_3()` reads two space-separated integers `n` and `m` from standard input, where `0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000` and `n + m > 0`. It then returns a map object containing these integers. The function handles the case where the input does not consist of exactly two space-separated integers by raising a ValueError. There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code.
