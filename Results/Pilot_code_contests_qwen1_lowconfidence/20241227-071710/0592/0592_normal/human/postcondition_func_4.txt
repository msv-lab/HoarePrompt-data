The function `func_5()` takes no parameters and returns a list generated by calling `func_3()`. After executing, the program will have returned a list of elements that were produced by `func_3()`. If `func_3()` returns an empty list, `func_5()` will also return an empty list. There are no specified edge cases or missing functionality within the provided code, so it is assumed that `func_3()` operates correctly as intended.
