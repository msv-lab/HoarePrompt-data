`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to `file`. Given that `sep` is a space character `' '`, this line of code will write a single space to `file`. The other variables (`func_20`, `at_start`, and `args`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`func_20` is defined, `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least one element, a space character has been written to `file`**
