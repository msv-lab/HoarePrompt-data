The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to `file`. Since the initial state does not specify any specific value for `kwargs`, we consider the default value provided, which is `\n`.

- `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` removes and returns the value for the key `'end'` from `kwargs` if it exists; otherwise, it returns the second argument, which is `\n`.
- This value is then written to `file`.

Given the initial state:
- `func_20` is defined
- `sep` is a space character `' '`
- `file` is `sys.stdout`
- `at_start` is `False`
- `x` is the last element in `args` processed by the loop
- The concatenated string of `args` elements separated by `sep` has been written to `file`

After executing the code:
- The value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` (which is `\n`) is written to `file`.
- The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`func_20` is defined, `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the last element in `args` processed by the loop, the concatenated string of `args` elements separated by `sep` has been written to `file`, and the value `\n` has been written to `file`.**
