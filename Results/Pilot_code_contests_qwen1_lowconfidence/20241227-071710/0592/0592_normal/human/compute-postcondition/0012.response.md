`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`, which is `sys.stdout` unless `at_start` is `False`. In that case, a space character would have already been written to `sys.stdout` before this line of code. Since the value of `x` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact content written, but we know that `sys.stdout` will now contain the string representation of `x` appended to whatever was previously there.

Output State: **`func_20` is defined, `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, if `at_start` is `False`, then a space character was written to `sys.stdout` before writing the string representation of `x`, otherwise, only the string representation of `x` was written to `sys.stdout`.**
