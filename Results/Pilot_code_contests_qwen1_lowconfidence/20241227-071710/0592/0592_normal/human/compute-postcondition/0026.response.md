Functionality: **The function `func_17` accepts a positive integer `n` greater than 1 and returns `False` in most cases. Specifically, it returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, or if `n` is divisible by any number of the form `i` or `i + 2` where `i` starts at 5 and increases by 6 in each iteration. It returns `True` only if `n` passes all these checks, indicating that `n` is a prime number greater than 3 and not divisible by 2, 3, or any number of the form `i` or `i + 2` up to the square root of `n`.**
