Functionality: **The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. It takes a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and prints them to a specified file with a given separator (`sep`). By default, the separator is a space character and the file is `sys.stdout`. After printing the arguments, it writes an end character (defaulting to a newline) and flushes the file buffer if requested. However, the function does not modify any external variables or state outside of its scope. There is no input or output associated with the function itself; it only prints to the specified file.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `args` is empty, the function will simply write the end character and flush the buffer if required.
- If `kwargs` contains keys other than `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush`, they will be ignored since the function only uses these specific keys.
- The function does not handle cases where `file` is not `sys.stdout` or a valid file object. If `file` is not a writable file-like object, attempting to write to it will result in an error.
