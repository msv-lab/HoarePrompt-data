`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to `file`. Given that `sep` is a space character `' '`, this line of code writes a space to `file`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_20` is defined, `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is `next_x`, and a space has been written to `file`.

Output State: **`func_20` is defined, `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is `next_x`, and a space has been written to `file`.**
