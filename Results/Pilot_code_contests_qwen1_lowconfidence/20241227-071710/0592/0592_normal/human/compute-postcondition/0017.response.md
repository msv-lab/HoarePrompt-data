`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. Since `x` is initially `next_x`, the string representation of `next_x` is written to `file`. The value of `file` remains `sys.stdout`, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_20` is defined, `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and `x` is `next_x`. The string representation of `next_x` has been written to `file`.

Output State: **`func_20` is defined, `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is `next_x`, and the string representation of `next_x` has been written to `file`.**
