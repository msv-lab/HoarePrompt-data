The line `at_start = False` changes the value of `at_start` from either `True` or `False` to `False`. This assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `at_start` and keeps the other variables as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`func_20` is defined, `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`.**
