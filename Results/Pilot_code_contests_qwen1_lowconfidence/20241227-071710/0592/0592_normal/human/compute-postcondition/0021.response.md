Postcondition: **`func_20` is defined, `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the last element in `args` processed by the loop, the concatenated string of `args` elements separated by `sep` has been written to `file`, and the value `\n` has been written to `file`. The current value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True` since it entered the if condition.**
