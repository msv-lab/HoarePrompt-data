The code writes the value of `sep` (which is a space character) to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). After this operation, the value of `sep` and `file` remains unchanged, but `sys.stdout` will have the space character written to it.

Output State: **`func_20` is defined, `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `sys.stdout` has a space character written to it, and `at_start` is `True`.**
