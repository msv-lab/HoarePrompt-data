The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. Based on the initial state, the value of `file` is `sys.stdout`, which means the string representation of `x` will be printed to the standard output. However, the code does not change the value of `x`, `sep`, `file`, or `at_start`. The only thing that changes is the content written to `file`.

Since the initial state indicates that if `at_start` is `False`, a space character has already been written to `file`, and if `at_start` is `True`, no space character has been written, the output of `file.write(str(x))` will depend on whether `at_start` was `False` or `True`.

- If `at_start` was `False`, a space followed by the string representation of `x` is written to `file`.
- If `at_start` was `True`, only the string representation of `x` is written to `file`.

Output State: **`func_20` is defined, `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is either `True` or `False`; if `at_start` was `False`, a space and the string representation of `x` are written to `sys.stdout`; if `at_start` was `True`, only the string representation of `x` is written to `sys.stdout`.**
