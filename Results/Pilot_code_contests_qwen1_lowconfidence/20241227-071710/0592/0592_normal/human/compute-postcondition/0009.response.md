According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop iterates over each element in `args`. At the end of the last iteration, `func_20` is defined, `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `False`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `args` must exist, and the loop variable `x` will be set to that element.

The state at the start of the next iteration should include:
- `func_20` is defined (unchanged from the previous iteration).
- `sep` is still a space character `' '` (unchanged from the previous iteration).
- `file` is still `sys.stdout` (unchanged from the previous iteration).
- `at_start` is now `True` because the loop has started again, and this is the first iteration after the previous one.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`func_20` is defined, `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`**
