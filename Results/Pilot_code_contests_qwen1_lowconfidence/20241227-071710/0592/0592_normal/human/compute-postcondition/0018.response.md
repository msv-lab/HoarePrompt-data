The variable `at_start` is updated to `False`, but its previous value was also `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_20` is defined, `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is `next_x`, and the string representation of `next_x` has been written to `file`.
