The code `file.flush()` flushes the write buffer for the file object `file`, which is currently set to `sys.stdout`. This action does not change the values of any variables other than potentially flushing the buffer, but it does not modify any variable values directly. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`func_20` is defined, `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the last element in `args` processed by the loop, the concatenated string of `args` elements separated by `sep` has been written to `file`, and the value `\n` has been written to `file`. The current value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True` since it entered the if condition.**
