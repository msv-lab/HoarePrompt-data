Let's analyze the loop step by step based on the provided initial state and the output states after a few iterations.

### Initial State:
- `func_20` is defined
- `sep` is a space character `' '`
- `file` is `sys.stdout`
- `at_start` is `True`

### Loop Code:
```python
for x in args:
    if not at_start:
        file.write(sep)
    file.write(str(x))
    at_start = False
```

### Observations:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute for each element in `args`. The loop condition is based on iterating through `args`.

2. **Effect of the Loop**:
   - On the first iteration, since `at_start` is initially `True`, no `sep` is written.
   - On the second iteration, `at_start` is set to `False` during the previous iteration, so `sep` is written.
   - For subsequent iterations, `sep` is always written before `str(x)`.

3. **Final State Analysis**:
   - After the loop completes, `at_start` will be `False` because the loop sets it to `False` at the end of each iteration.
   - The value of `x` will be the last element in `args` processed by the loop.
   - The `file` object will contain the concatenated strings with `sep` inserted between elements.

4. **State of Other Variables**:
   - `sep` remains unchanged as `' '`
   - `file` remains `sys.stdout`
   - `args` itself is not modified; its state is dependent on the input to the function, not on the loop itself.

### Conclusion:
After the loop has executed all iterations, the following conditions hold true:
- `func_20` remains defined.
- `sep` remains `' '` (a space character).
- `file` remains `sys.stdout`.
- `at_start` is `False`.
- `x` is the last element in `args` processed by the loop, and the concatenated string of `args` elements separated by `sep` has been written to `file`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`func_20` is defined, `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the last element in `args` processed by the loop, and the concatenated string of `args` elements separated by `sep` has been written to `file`.**
