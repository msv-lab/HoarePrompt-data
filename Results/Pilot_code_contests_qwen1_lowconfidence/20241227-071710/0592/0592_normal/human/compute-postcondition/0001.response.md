The code extracts values from the `kwargs` dictionary using the `pop` method with default values. Specifically, it pops the value associated with the key `'sep'` from `kwargs` and assigns the result to `sep`, with a default value of a single space `' '` if the key is not present. Similarly, it pops the value associated with the key `'file'` from `kwargs` and assigns the result to `file`, with a default value of `sys.stdout` if the key is not present.

Since the initial state only mentions that the function `func_20` is defined, no variables are directly affected by this code snippet. The variables `sep` and `file` are introduced and initialized based on the `kwargs` dictionary, but their values are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect that these new variables exist with their respective default values.

Output State: **the function `func_20` is defined, `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`**
