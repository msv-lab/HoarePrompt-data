According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. For the loop to execute, `args` must contain at least one element. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop iterates over each element in `args`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `args` must have at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `func_20` is defined.
- `sep` is a space character `' '`.
- `file` is `sys.stdout`.
- `at_start` is `True`.

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `args` must have at least one element.

State: **`func_20` is defined, `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`, `args` must have at least one element**
