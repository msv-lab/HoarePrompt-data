The function `func_2()` reads two space-separated integers `n` and `m` from the standard input, where `n` represents the number of students using two-block pieces and `m` represents the number of students using three-block pieces. It then returns these integers as the output. There are no parameters passed to the function, and it assumes that the input is correctly formatted. Potential edge cases include incorrect formatting (e.g., more or fewer than two integers separated by spaces) or non-integer inputs, which would cause the program to behave unpredictably. If such edge cases occur, the function does not handle them and may lead to errors.
