The provided code defines a lambda function `rstrs` that reads a line from standard input and splits it into a list of strings, stripping any trailing whitespace. This does not change the values of the existing variables but instead creates a new function. The variables `n` and `rstr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the following n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing an edge between nodes u and v, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v; the edges provided form a valid tree; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it, and strips any trailing whitespace.**
