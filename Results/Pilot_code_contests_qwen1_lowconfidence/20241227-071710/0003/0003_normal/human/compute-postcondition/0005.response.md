The code defines a lambda function `rint_2d` which creates a list of integers by reading `n` integers from standard input, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The variables `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, and `rstr_2d` remain unchanged.

Since the lambda function `rint_2d` is defined but not called, no input is read, and the variables `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, and `rstr_2d` retain their initial values. The only new variable `rint_2d` is defined, but it does not store any values since it is not invoked.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it, and strips any trailing whitespace; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input; `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it, and converts it to a list of integers; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that reads `n` lines from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace from each line; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of `n` integers read from standard input.**
