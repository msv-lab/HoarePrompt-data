The given code does not actually execute any operations on the variables or change their values. Instead, it defines a lambda function `rints` which reads multiple integers from standard input, splits them, and converts them to integers. This lambda function itself does not get called in the provided snippet, meaning no actual computation or assignment happens to any of the existing variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the following n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing an edge between nodes u and v, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v; the edges provided form a valid tree; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it, and strips any trailing whitespace; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input; `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it, and converts it to a list of integers.**
