The provided code defines a lambda function `pr` that writes a line to standard output, joining the elements of the `args` list with the specified `sep`. However, this does not affect any existing variables or their values. The lambda function itself does not assign any new values to variables or perform any operations that would change the initial state.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it, and strips any trailing whitespace; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input; `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it, and converts it to a list of integers; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that reads `n` lines from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace from each line; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of `n` integers read from standard input; `rints_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of lists of integers read from standard input; `pr` is a lambda function that writes a line to standard output, joining the elements of the `args` list with the specified `sep`.**
