The code defines a lambda function `rints_2d` that returns a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains integers read from standard input. However, no input is provided to this function, so the value of `rints_2d` is not determined. The variables `n`, `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rstr_2d`, and `rint_2d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^5; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it, and strips any trailing whitespace; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input; `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it, and converts it to a list of integers; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that reads `n` lines from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace from each line; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of `n` integers read from standard input; `rints_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of lists of integers read from standard input.**
