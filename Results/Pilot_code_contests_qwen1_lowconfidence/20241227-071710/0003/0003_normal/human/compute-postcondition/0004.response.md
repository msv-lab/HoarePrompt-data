The given code defines a lambda function `rstr_2d` that creates a list of strings read from standard input. The function takes one argument `n`, which represents the number of strings to read. The code does not provide a specific value for `n` or perform any reading operations; it only defines the lambda function. Therefore, the lambda function `rstr_2d` is now defined and ready to be used with an argument `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it, and strips any trailing whitespace; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input; `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it, and converts it to a list of integers; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that reads `n` lines from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace from each line.**
