The code snippet provided does not perform any operations on the existing variables. It simply defines a lambda function `rstr` that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. This function does not affect the values of `n`, the list of edges, or any other variables. 

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the following n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing an edge between nodes u and v, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v; the edges provided form a valid tree; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.**
