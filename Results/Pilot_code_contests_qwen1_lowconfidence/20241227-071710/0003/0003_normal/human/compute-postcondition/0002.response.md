The given code defines a lambda function `rint` that reads an integer from standard input. This function does not affect any existing variables but introduces a new way to read integers. The initial state remains unchanged except for the introduction of this new function.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the following n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing an edge between nodes u and v, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v; the edges provided form a valid tree; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it, and strips any trailing whitespace; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input.**
