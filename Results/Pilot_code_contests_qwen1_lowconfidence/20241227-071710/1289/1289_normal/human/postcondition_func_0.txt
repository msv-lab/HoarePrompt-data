The function reads an integer \( n \) representing the number of mines and \( n \) pairs of integers representing the coordinates of each mine from the standard input. It then calculates the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum \( x \)-coordinates (\( maxx - minx \)) and the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum \( y \)-coordinates (\( maxy - miny \)). Finally, it prints the square of the larger of these two differences.
