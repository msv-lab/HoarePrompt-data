The code snippet updates the value of `maxy` to be the maximum of its current value and `b`. Since `b` is an integer entered by the user, the value of `maxy` will be the larger of the current value of `maxy` and `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `z` is 2
- `t` remains between 2 and 1000
- `maxx` is the maximum of `-10` and `a`
- `minx` is `min(10, a)`
- `miny` remains the minimum of `1000000000000000000` and `b`
- `maxy` remains the maximum of `-10` and `b`
- `a` and `b` are integers entered by the user

After executing the code snippet:
- `maxy` will be updated to the maximum of its current value (`maxy`) and the new value of `b`.

The output state will be:
- `z` is 2
- `t` remains between 2 and 1000
- `maxx` is the maximum of `-10` and `a`
- `minx` is `min(10, a)`
- `miny` remains the minimum of `1000000000000000000` and `b`
- `maxy` is the maximum of `-10` and `b`, updated to the maximum of its current value and `b`

Output State: **`z` is 2; `t` remains between 2 and 1000; `maxx` is the maximum of `-10` and `a`; `minx` is `min(10, a)`; `miny` remains the minimum of `1000000000000000000` and `b`; `maxy` is the maximum of `-10` and `b`, updated to the maximum of its current value and `b`**
