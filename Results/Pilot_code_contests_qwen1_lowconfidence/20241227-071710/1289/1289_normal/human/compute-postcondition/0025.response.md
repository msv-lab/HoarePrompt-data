Functionality: **The function reads an integer \( n \) representing the number of mines and \( n \) pairs of integers representing the coordinates of each mine from the standard input. It then calculates the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum \( x \)-coordinates (\( maxx - minx \)) and the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum \( y \)-coordinates (\( maxy - miny \)). Finally, it prints the square of the larger of these two differences.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted with exactly one integer per line for \( n \) and then \( n \) pairs of integers for the coordinates. If there are any discrepancies in the input format, such as incorrect numbers of inputs or non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError` when attempting to parse the input.
- The function does not handle negative input values for \( n \) or coordinates. If \( n \) is less than 2 or any coordinate is outside the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), the function may produce unexpected results or raise exceptions.
