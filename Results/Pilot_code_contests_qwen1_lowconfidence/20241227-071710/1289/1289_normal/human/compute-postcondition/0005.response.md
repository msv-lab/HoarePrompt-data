The code `a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The variables `t`, `maxx`, `minx`, `miny`, and `z` are not affected by this operation.

The output state will include the new variables `a` and `b` which will hold the values entered by the user, while the existing variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `maxx` is -10, `minx` is 10, `miny` is 1000000000000000000, `z` is 0, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user**
