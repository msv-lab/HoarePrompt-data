The code updates `maxy` to the maximum of its current value (`max(-10, b)`) and the user-entered value `b`. Since `maxy` is initially set to the maximum of `-10` and `b`, the new value of `maxy` remains the same as its initial value because `max(-10, b)` is already the maximum of these two values.

Therefore, the values of `t`, `maxx`, `minx`, `miny`, `maxy`, `z`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `maxx` is the maximum of `-10` and `a`, `minx` is 10, `miny` is the minimum of `1000000000000000000` and `b`, `maxy` is the maximum of `-10` and `b`, `z` is 1, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its original value and the user-entered value `a`.**
