The line of code `miny = 10 ** 18` assigns the value `10 ** 18` (which is 1000000000000000000) to the variable `miny`. The values of `t`, `maxx`, and `minx` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `maxx` is -10, `minx` is 10, `miny` is 1000000000000000000**
