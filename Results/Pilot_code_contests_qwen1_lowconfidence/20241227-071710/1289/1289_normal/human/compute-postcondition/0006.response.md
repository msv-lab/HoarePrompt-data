`maxx` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value (`-10`) and the value of `a`. Since `a` is an integer entered by the user, its exact value is not known from the initial state, but we know it is an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `maxx` is the maximum value between `-10` and `a`, `minx` is 10, `miny` is 1000000000000000000, `z` is 0, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `maxx` is the maximum value between `-10` and `a`, `minx` is 10, `miny` is 1000000000000000000, `z` is 0, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user.**
