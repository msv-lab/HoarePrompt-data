The code initializes `maxx` and `maxy` to `-10 ** 18`. This does not affect the value of `t`, which remains an integer between 2 and 1000. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `maxx` and `maxy`, and retains the initial value of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `maxx` is -10 ** 18, `maxy` is -10 ** 18**
