`t` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` reads a line from the input and `int()` converts it to an integer. This means `t` now holds the number of mines, which is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is the number of mines (an integer between 2 and 1000), and the coordinates of the mines are yet to be inputted.**
