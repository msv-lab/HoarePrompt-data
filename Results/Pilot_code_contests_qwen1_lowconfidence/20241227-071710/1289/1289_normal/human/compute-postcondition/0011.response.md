The code `a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `maxx`, `minx`, `miny`, `maxy`, `z`, and the previous value of `a` and `b` are updated based on the new values entered.

- `maxx` is the maximum value between `-10` and the new value of `a`.
- `minx` is the smaller of `10` and the new value of `a`.
- `miny` is the minimum of `1000000000000000000` and the new value of `b`.
- `maxy` is the maximum of `-10` and the new value of `b`.

The output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `maxx` is the maximum value between `-10` and `a`, `minx` is the smaller of `10` and `a`, `miny` is the minimum of `1000000000000000000` and `b`, `maxy` is the maximum of `-10` and `b`, `z` is 1, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user**
