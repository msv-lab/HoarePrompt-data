The code `a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. This means the values of `z`, `t`, `maxx`, `minx`, `miny`, and `maxy` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are now set to the integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`z` is 2; `t` remains between 2 and 1000; `maxx` remains the maximum of `-10` and `a`; `minx` remains 10; `miny` remains the minimum of `1000000000000000000` and `b`; `maxy` remains the maximum of `-10` and `b`; `a` and `b` are integers entered by the user.**
