`minx` is updated to be the minimum value between its current value (which is 10) and the value of `a`. Since `a` is an integer entered by the user, the new value of `minx` will be the smaller of 10 and `a`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `maxx` is the maximum value between `-10` and `a`, `minx` is the smaller of 10 and `a`, `miny` is 1000000000000000000, `z` is 0, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user.**
