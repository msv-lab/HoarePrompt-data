The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters since the parameter constraints mention that the input consists of two lines read from the standard input. The first line contains a single integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), representing the number of mines. The following `n` lines each contain two integers `xi` and `yi` (-10^9 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 10^9), representing the coordinates of each mine. All coordinates are distinct.

The output of the function depends on the processing of these inputs but the function itself does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read the number of mines and their coordinates from the standard input and process them accordingly.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of mines and `n` pairs of integers representing the coordinates of each mine from the standard input.**
