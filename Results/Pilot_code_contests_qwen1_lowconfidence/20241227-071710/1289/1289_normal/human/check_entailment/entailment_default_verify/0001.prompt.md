You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Many computer strategy games require building cities, recruiting army, conquering tribes, collecting resources. Sometimes it leads to interesting problems. 

Let's suppose that your task is to build a square city. The world map uses the Cartesian coordinates. The sides of the city should be parallel to coordinate axes. The map contains mines with valuable resources, located at some points with integer coordinates. The sizes of mines are relatively small, i.e. they can be treated as points. The city should be built in such a way that all the mines are inside or on the border of the city square. 

Building a city takes large amount of money depending on the size of the city, so you have to build the city with the minimum area. Given the positions of the mines find the minimum possible area of the city.

Input

The first line of the input contains number n — the number of mines on the map (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000). Each of the next n lines contains a pair of integers xi and yi — the coordinates of the corresponding mine ( - 109 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 109). All points are pairwise distinct.

Output

Print the minimum area of the city that can cover all the mines with valuable resources.

Program:

def func():
    t = int(raw_input())
    (maxx, maxy) = (-10 ** 18, -10 ** 18)
    minx = 10 ** 18
    miny = 10 ** 18
    for z in xrange(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        maxx = max(maxx, a)
        minx = min(minx, a)
        maxy = max(maxy, b)
        miny = min(miny, b)
    print(max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)) ** 2


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum area of the city that can cover all the mines. The issue lies in how the maximum and minimum x and y values are being calculated. The formula used to compute the area, `(max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)) ** 2`, will always return the square of the larger dimension difference, which might not result in the minimum possible area of the city.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
0 0
0 3
```

The program will output `9`, but the correct minimum area should be `4` because the smallest square that can cover both points (0,0) and (0,3) has a side length of 3, resulting in an area of 9. However, if we adjust the positions slightly to (0,0) and (2,3), the correct minimum area should still be `4`.

The program fails to account for the scenario where the optimal square might not align perfectly with the larger dimension. The correct approach would be to take the maximum difference between the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates separately and then square the maximum of these two differences to get the minimum area.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    minx, maxx = float('inf'), float('-inf')
    miny, maxy = float('inf'), float('-inf')
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        minx, maxx = min(minx, x), max(maxx, x)
        miny, maxy = min(miny, y), max(maxy, y)
    side_length = max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)
    print(side_length ** 2)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the side length of the city is calculated correctly and then squares it to get the minimum area.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer \( n \) representing the number of mines and \( n \) pairs of integers representing the coordinates of each mine from the standard input. It then calculates the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum \( x \)-coordinates (\( maxx - minx \)) and the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum \( y \)-coordinates (\( maxy - miny \)). Finally, it prints the square of the larger of these two differences.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
