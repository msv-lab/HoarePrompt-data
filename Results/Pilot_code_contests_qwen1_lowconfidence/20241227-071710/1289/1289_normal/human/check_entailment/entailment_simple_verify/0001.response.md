Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated version clearly shows that the program calculates the maximum and minimum x and y values separately but incorrectly computes the area of the square city. Specifically, the line `print(max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)) ** 2` always returns the square of the larger dimension difference, which does not necessarily yield the minimum possible area of the city. 

To correctly solve the problem, the side length of the square should be determined by the maximum difference between the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates separately, and then the area should be computed as the square of the maximum of these two differences. The annotated version highlights that the current implementation does not account for the scenario where the optimal square might not align perfectly with the larger dimension, leading to an incorrect calculation of the minimum area.

Therefore, the original assessment is maintained as the program does not meet the problem description requirements.
