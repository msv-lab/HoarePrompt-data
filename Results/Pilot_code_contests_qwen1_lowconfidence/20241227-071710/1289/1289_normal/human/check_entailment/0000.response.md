Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum area of the city that can cover all the mines. The program calculates the width and height of the bounding box formed by the mines but then squares the maximum of these two values instead of squaring the sum of half the differences to get the actual minimum area of the square.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
0 0
2 2
4 4
```

The correct minimum area should be 16 (a 4x4 square), but the program would incorrectly output 12, which is \( \text{max}(4-0, 4-0)^2 = 4^2 = 16 \).

To fix this, the program should calculate the differences and then use the larger difference to determine the side length of the square, and then square that value:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    maxx, maxy = float('-inf'), float('-inf')
    minx, miny = float('inf'), float('inf')
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        maxx = max(maxx, x)
        minx = min(minx, x)
        maxy = max(maxy, y)
        miny = min(miny, y)
    
    side_length = max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)
    print(side_length ** 2)
```

This corrected version ensures that the side length of the square is the maximum of the differences between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and the maximum and minimum y-coordinates, and then squares that value to get the correct area.
