You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Many computer strategy games require building cities, recruiting army, conquering tribes, collecting resources. Sometimes it leads to interesting problems. 

Let's suppose that your task is to build a square city. The world map uses the Cartesian coordinates. The sides of the city should be parallel to coordinate axes. The map contains mines with valuable resources, located at some points with integer coordinates. The sizes of mines are relatively small, i.e. they can be treated as points. The city should be built in such a way that all the mines are inside or on the border of the city square. 

Building a city takes large amount of money depending on the size of the city, so you have to build the city with the minimum area. Given the positions of the mines find the minimum possible area of the city.

Input

The first line of the input contains number n — the number of mines on the map (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000). Each of the next n lines contains a pair of integers xi and yi — the coordinates of the corresponding mine ( - 109 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 109). All points are pairwise distinct.

Output

Print the minimum area of the city that can cover all the mines with valuable resources.

Program:

def func():
    t = int(raw_input())
    (maxx, maxy) = (-10 ** 18, -10 ** 18)
    minx = 10 ** 18
    miny = 10 ** 18
    for z in xrange(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        maxx = max(maxx, a)
        minx = min(minx, a)
        maxy = max(maxy, b)
        miny = min(miny, b)
    print(max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)) ** 2


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum area of the city that can cover all the mines. The program calculates the width and height of the bounding box formed by the mines but then squares the maximum of these two values instead of squaring the sum of half the differences to get the actual minimum area of the square.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
0 0
2 2
4 4
```

The correct minimum area should be 16 (a 4x4 square), but the program would incorrectly output 12, which is \( \text{max}(4-0, 4-0)^2 = 4^2 = 16 \).

To fix this, the program should calculate the differences and then use the larger difference to determine the side length of the square, and then square that value:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    maxx, maxy = float('-inf'), float('-inf')
    minx, miny = float('inf'), float('inf')
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        maxx = max(maxx, x)
        minx = min(minx, x)
        maxy = max(maxy, y)
        miny = min(miny, y)
    
    side_length = max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)
    print(side_length ** 2)
```

This corrected version ensures that the side length of the square is the maximum of the differences between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and the maximum and minimum y-coordinates, and then squares that value to get the correct area.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), representing the number of mines. The following n lines each contain two integers xi and yi (-10^9 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 10^9), representing the coordinates of each mine. All coordinates are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(raw_input())
    maxx, maxy = -10 ** 18, -10 ** 18
    minx = 10 ** 18
    miny = 10 ** 18
    for z in xrange(t):
        a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        maxx = max(maxx, a)
        
        minx = min(minx, a)
        
        maxy = max(maxy, b)
        
        miny = min(miny, b)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `maxx` is the maximum value among all `a` values entered by the user, `minx` is the minimum value among all `a` values entered by the user, `miny` is the minimum value among all `b` values entered by the user, `maxy` is the maximum value among all `b` values entered by the user, `z` is `t-1`, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user.
    print(max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)) ** 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer \( n \) representing the number of mines and \( n \) pairs of integers representing the coordinates of each mine from the standard input. It then calculates the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum \( x \)-coordinates (\( maxx - minx \)) and the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum \( y \)-coordinates (\( maxy - miny \)). Finally, it prints the square of the larger of these two differences.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
