You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Many computer strategy games require building cities, recruiting army, conquering tribes, collecting resources. Sometimes it leads to interesting problems. 

Let's suppose that your task is to build a square city. The world map uses the Cartesian coordinates. The sides of the city should be parallel to coordinate axes. The map contains mines with valuable resources, located at some points with integer coordinates. The sizes of mines are relatively small, i.e. they can be treated as points. The city should be built in such a way that all the mines are inside or on the border of the city square. 

Building a city takes large amount of money depending on the size of the city, so you have to build the city with the minimum area. Given the positions of the mines find the minimum possible area of the city.

Input

The first line of the input contains number n — the number of mines on the map (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000). Each of the next n lines contains a pair of integers xi and yi — the coordinates of the corresponding mine ( - 109 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 109). All points are pairwise distinct.

Output

Print the minimum area of the city that can cover all the mines with valuable resources.

Program:
```
def func():
    t = int(raw_input())
    (maxx, maxy) = (-10 ** 18, -10 ** 18)
    minx = 10 ** 18
    miny = 10 ** 18
    for z in xrange(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        maxx = max(maxx, a)
        minx = min(minx, a)
        maxy = max(maxy, b)
        miny = min(miny, b)
    print(max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)) ** 2


```
Output hints: The function reads an integer \( n \) representing the number of mines and \( n \) pairs of integers representing the coordinates of each mine from the standard input. It then calculates the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum \( x \)-coordinates (\( maxx - minx \)) and the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum \( y \)-coordinates (\( maxy - miny \)). Finally, it prints the square of the larger of these two differences.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
