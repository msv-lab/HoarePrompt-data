Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum area of the city that can cover all the mines. The logic in the code assumes that the side length of the city is the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum \( x \)-coordinates or the maximum and minimum \( y \)-coordinates, whichever is larger. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum area because it does not consider the orientation of the mines relative to the axes.

To find the minimum area, the city should be oriented such that its sides are aligned with the smallest bounding box that encloses all the mines. The correct approach would be to find the minimum and maximum \( x \)-coordinates and the minimum and maximum \( y \)-coordinates, and then the side length of the city should be the maximum of the absolute differences between these coordinates.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
0 0
2 2
1 3
```

The code will output:
```
4
```

However, the correct minimum area is 5 because the smallest square that can cover all the points is with side length 3 (from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 0 \) to \( y = 3 \)), which gives an area of \( 3 \times \frac{5}{3} = 5 \).

Therefore, the code is incorrect for this case and other similar cases where the mines are not aligned with the coordinate axes.
