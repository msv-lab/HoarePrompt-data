Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the solution to the given problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of mines (`n`) and their respective coordinates. It ensures that the input constraints are respected (i.e., \(2 \leq n \leq 1000\) and the coordinates are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\)).

2. **Coordinate Calculation**: 
   - The program initializes `maxx`, `maxy`, `minx`, and `miny` to extreme values to ensure that any coordinate input will update them appropriately.
   - It iterates through each mine's coordinates, updating `maxx`, `maxy`, `minx`, and `miny` to reflect the largest and smallest x and y values encountered.

3. **City Size Calculation**:
   - After processing all the coordinates, the program computes the width and height of the square city required to cover all mines.
   - It determines the maximum distance between the minimum and maximum x-coordinates (`maxx - minx`) and the maximum distance between the minimum and maximum y-coordinates (`maxy - miny`).
   - The side length of the city square is the maximum of these two distances.
   - Finally, the program prints the area of the city square, which is the square of the computed side length.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The output is formatted as required, printing the minimum area of the city that can cover all the mines.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly follows the problem description. It calculates the minimum area of the city that can cover all the mines by determining the bounding box (the smallest rectangle aligned with the coordinate axes) that encloses all the mines and then using the dimensions of this rectangle to compute the area of the square city. Therefore, the program is correct.
