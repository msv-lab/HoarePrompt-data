Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for finding the minimum area of a square city that can cover all the mines. The code calculates the differences between the maximum and minimum \( x \)-coordinates and \( y \)-coordinates separately and prints the square of the larger of these two differences. This approach does not guarantee that the resulting square will cover all the mines.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the following example:

- Input:
  ```
  3
  0 0
  1 1
  2 2
  ```

According to the code:
- \( minx = 0 \), \( maxx = 2 \)
- \( miny = 0 \), \( maxy = 2 \)

The code calculates:
- \( maxx - minx = 2 \)
- \( maxy - miny = 2 \)

The larger difference is 2, so the code outputs \( 2^2 = 4 \).

However, the correct minimum area of the city that can cover all the mines is actually 9, because the smallest square that can cover all three points has a side length of 2 (from \((0,0)\) to \((2,2)\)), making the area \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \), but considering the diagonal distance, the correct side length is 2\(\sqrt{2}\), making the area \( (2\sqrt{2})^2 = 8 \). But the correct minimal integer area that covers all points is actually 9, forming a 3x3 square.

Thus, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
