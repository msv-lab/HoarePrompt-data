Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum area of the city that can cover all the mines. The issue lies in how the maximum and minimum x and y values are being calculated. The formula used to compute the area, `(max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)) ** 2`, will always return the square of the larger dimension difference, which might not result in the minimum possible area of the city.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
0 0
0 3
```

The program will output `9`, but the correct minimum area should be `4` because the smallest square that can cover both points (0,0) and (0,3) has a side length of 3, resulting in an area of 9. However, if we adjust the positions slightly to (0,0) and (2,3), the correct minimum area should still be `4`.

The program fails to account for the scenario where the optimal square might not align perfectly with the larger dimension. The correct approach would be to take the maximum difference between the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates separately and then square the maximum of these two differences to get the minimum area.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    minx, maxx = float('inf'), float('-inf')
    miny, maxy = float('inf'), float('-inf')
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        minx, maxx = min(minx, x), max(maxx, x)
        miny, maxy = min(miny, y), max(maxy, y)
    side_length = max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)
    print(side_length ** 2)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the side length of the city is calculated correctly and then squares it to get the minimum area.
