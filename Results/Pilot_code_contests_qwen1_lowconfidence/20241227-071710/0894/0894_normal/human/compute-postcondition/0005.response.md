`ans` is assigned the value of `ans` concatenated with `s[i]`. The value of `i` is 0, and since `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in ascending order, `s[0]` is the first string in the list. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `l` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the first string in the list `s`**
