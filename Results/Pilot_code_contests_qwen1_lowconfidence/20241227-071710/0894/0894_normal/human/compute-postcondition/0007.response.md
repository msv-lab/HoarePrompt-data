The code `ans += s[i]` attempts to concatenate the string stored in `ans` with the string at index `i` in the list `s`. However, since `ans` is initially a string (the first string in the list `s`), the `+=` operator will convert `ans` to a string and concatenate the two strings.

Given that `i` is initialized to 1, the code will attempt to access the second element in the list `s`. Since `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in ascending order, and assuming `n` is at least 2, `s[i]` is the second string in the list.

Let's denote the first string in the list `s` as `s[0]` which is equal to `ans`. Therefore, `ans += s[i]` will concatenate `ans` with `s[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `l` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the concatenation of the first string in the list `s` and the second string in the list `s`.**
