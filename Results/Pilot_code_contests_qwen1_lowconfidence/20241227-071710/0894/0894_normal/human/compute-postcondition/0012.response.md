The function `func` accepts no parameters directly specified in the given code snippet. However, based on the provided constraints, it seems the function should process some internal data or input that adheres to the given conditions (N and L are integers such that 1 ≤ N, L ≤ 100, and for each i, S_i is a string of length L consisting of lowercase letters). The output is not specified in the provided information.

Given the constraints but without a specific output mentioned, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes N strings, each of length L, where 1 ≤ N, L ≤ 100 and each string consists of lowercase letters.**
