`s.sort()` sorts the list `s` in ascending order. The sorting operation does not return a new list but modifies the original list `s`. Since the initial state is that `s` is a list of `n` strings, each string being an input from the user, after sorting, `s` will be a list of these strings sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `l` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in ascending order**
