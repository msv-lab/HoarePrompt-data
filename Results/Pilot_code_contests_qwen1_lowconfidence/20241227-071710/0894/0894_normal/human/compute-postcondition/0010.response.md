Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 100, `l` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the concatenation of all strings in the list `s`.** 

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution and Iterations:**
   - The loop iterates over the range `xrange(n)`, where `n` is the length of the list `s`.
   - For each iteration, the string `s[i]` is concatenated to `ans`.

2. **Final Iteration:**
   - When the loop runs `n` times, `i` will take the value `n-1`.
   - After the last iteration, `ans` will contain the concatenation of all strings in the list `s` (from `s[0]` to `s[n-1]`).

3. **Post-Loop Variables:**
   - `i` will be `n-1` because the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Since the loop completes, `n` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `l` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `s` remains a list of `n` strings sorted in ascending order.
   - `ans` contains the concatenated result of all strings in `s`.

4. **Non-Execution Case:**
   - If the loop does not execute (`n` is 0), then `i` remains 0.
   - `ans` will still be an empty string since no concatenation occurs.

Thus, the final state after the loop has completed all its iterations is that `ans` is the concatenation of all strings in the list `s`.
