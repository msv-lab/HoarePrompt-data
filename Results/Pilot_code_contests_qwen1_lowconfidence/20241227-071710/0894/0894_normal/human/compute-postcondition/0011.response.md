The code `print(ans)` prints the value of the variable `ans`, which is the concatenation of all strings in the list `s`. Since the list `s` contains `n` strings sorted in ascending order and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, the value of `ans` is the concatenated form of these `n` strings. However, the specific value of `ans` cannot be determined without knowing the actual strings in `s`. The other variables `i`, `l`, and the list `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 100, `l` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the concatenation of all strings in the list `s`, and `ans` is printed.**
