`n` and `l` are assigned the values obtained from `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This means that `n` and `l` will be integers split from the input and converted to integers. However, the exact values of `n` and `l` are not specified in the initial state. The preconditions that remain valid are that `1 ≤ n, l ≤ 100`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `l` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)`**
