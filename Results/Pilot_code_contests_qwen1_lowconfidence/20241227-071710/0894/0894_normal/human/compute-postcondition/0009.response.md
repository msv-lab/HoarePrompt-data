The value of `ans` is initially the concatenation of the first string in the list `s` and the second string in the list `s`. The value of `i` is 2. The operation `ans += s[i]` appends the third string in the list `s` (since indexing starts at 0) to `ans`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `l` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the concatenation of the first string in the list `s`, the second string in the list `s`, and the third string in the list `s`**
