The code `s = [raw_input() for _ in xrange(n)]` creates a list `s` containing `n` elements, each element being a string input from the user. Since the raw_input function reads a line of text from the standard input, each element of the list `s` will be a string. However, the actual strings cannot be determined without knowing the inputs, but we know that `n` integers between 1 and 100 inclusive will be used to generate these strings.

The variable `l` remains unchanged as the code does not interact with it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `l` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a list of `n` strings, each string being an input from the user**
