Functionality: **The function processes a set of N strings, each of length L, where 1 ≤ N, L ≤ 100, and concatenates them into a single string. The function reads N and L from standard input, followed by N lines of strings. It then sorts these strings in ascending order and concatenates them into a single string `ans`. After executing the function, the final state of the program is that `ans` contains the concatenated and sorted strings, and `n` and `l` retain their original values from the input. There are no direct parameters passed to the function; instead, it reads the necessary values from standard input.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If N or L is less than 1 or greater than 100, the function still proceeds as long as the constraints are met within the code.
- The function assumes that all input strings are of length L, which might not always be true in real-world scenarios without additional validation.

**Missing functionality:**
- The function does not validate whether all input strings have the same length L. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the strings do not meet this requirement.
