Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning the loop variable `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`.
   - The key variables here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `l` is an integer between 1 and 100 (though this variable is not used in the loop).
   - `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in ascending order.
   - `ans` is an empty string.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because `range(n)` would generate no elements if `n` were 0.
   - `i` will start from 0 and increment up to `n-1`.

4. **Required Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop depends on `n`, we need to ensure `n` is at least 1.
   - `i` should be set to 0 before the loop starts.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` must be 0.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `l` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in ascending order, `ans` is an empty string**.
