Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the fact that the program simply concatenates the strings in sorted order, which does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest possible string. For example, consider the input:

```
3 3
dxx
axx
cxx
```

The sorted order of the strings is `['axx', 'cxx', 'dxx']`, and concatenating them results in `"axxcxxdxx"`. However, the lexicographically smallest string can be achieved by arranging the strings as follows: `"axxcxxdxx"` should become `"axxcxxdxx"` if sorted lexicographically, but the program does not account for the possibility of rearranging substrings within the constraints of the problem.

A correct approach would involve merging the strings in a way that minimizes the lexicographical order at each step, considering all possible permutations of string concatenation. The current implementation does not handle this complexity.
