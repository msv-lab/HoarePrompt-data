You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Iroha has a sequence of N strings S_1, S_2, ..., S_N. The length of each string is L.

She will concatenate all of the strings in some order, to produce a long string.

Among all strings that she can produce in this way, find the lexicographically smallest one.

Here, a string s=s_1s_2s_3...s_n is lexicographically smaller than another string t=t_1t_2t_3...t_m if and only if one of the following holds:

* There exists an index i(1≦i≦min(n,m)), such that s_j = t_j for all indices j(1≦j<i), and s_i<t_i.
* s_i = t_i for all integers i(1≦i≦min(n,m)), and n<m.

Constraints

* 1 ≦ N, L ≦ 100
* For each i, the length of S_i equals L.
* For each i, S_i consists of lowercase letters.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N L
S_1
S_2
:
S_N


Output

Print the lexicographically smallest string that Iroha can produce.

Example

Input

3 3
dxx
axx
cxx


Output

axxcxxdxx
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, l) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    s = [raw_input() for _ in xrange(n)]
    s.sort()
    ans = ''
    for i in xrange(n):
        ans += s[i]
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the concatenation of strings to form the lexicographically smallest string. The issue lies in the sorting step. The `sort()` method sorts the list in place using the default comparison, which is based on the lexicographical order of the strings themselves, not their individual characters. This means that if the first character of two strings is the same, it will compare the second character, and so on. However, we need to ensure that the entire sequence of concatenated strings is lexicographically minimized.

To fix this, we should sort the list of strings based on each string's characters lexicographically. We can achieve this by defining a custom key function for the `sorted` method that sorts each string character by character.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, l) = map(int, input().split())
    s = [input() for _ in range(n)]
    s = sorted(s)  # Sort the strings lexicographically
    ans = ''.join(s)  # Concatenate the sorted strings
    print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected program will correctly generate the lexicographically smallest string by ensuring that the sorting is done based on the lexicographical order of the individual characters in each string.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes a set of N strings, each of length L, where 1 ≤ N, L ≤ 100, and concatenates them into a single string. The function reads N and L from standard input, followed by N lines of strings. It then sorts these strings in ascending order and concatenates them into a single string `ans`. After executing the function, the final state of the program is that `ans` contains the concatenated and sorted strings, and `n` and `l` retain their original values from the input. There are no direct parameters passed to the function; instead, it reads the necessary values from standard input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
