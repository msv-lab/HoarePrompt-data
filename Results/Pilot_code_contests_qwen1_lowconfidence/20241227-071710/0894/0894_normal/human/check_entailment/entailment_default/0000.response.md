Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem description. The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest string by concatenating the given strings in some order. However, the current implementation simply sorts the strings lexicographically and concatenates them in that order. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal order to achieve the lexicographically smallest concatenated string.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
dxx
axx
cxx
```

The provided code will sort the strings as `['axx', 'cxx', 'dxx']` and concatenate them to form `axxcxxdxx`. However, the lexicographically smallest string can be achieved by concatenating the strings in the order `['axx', 'cxx', 'dxx']`, resulting in `axxcxxdxx`. But if the strings were different, like `['dxx', 'a', 'b']`, sorting would yield `['a', 'b', 'dxx']`, and concatenating them would result in `abddxx`, which is not the lexicographically smallest possible string (`ab` could be rearranged to `ba` if needed).

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to find the optimal order to concatenate the strings, which is more complex than simple lexicographical sorting.
