Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the solution described in the problem statement. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of strings `N` and the length of each string `L` from standard input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This matches the first line of the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Storing Strings**: The program then reads `N` lines of input (strings) and stores them in a list `s`. This correctly captures the next `N` lines of input.

3. **Sorting Strings**: The program sorts the list `s` using `s.sort()`. Sorting the strings lexicographically ensures that the smallest possible string is formed when they are concatenated.

4. **Concatenating Strings**: The program iterates through the sorted list `s` and concatenates each string to form the result `ans`. This step ensures that the final concatenated string is the lexicographically smallest possible string.

5. **Outputting Result**: Finally, the program prints the concatenated string `ans`, which is the desired output.

The program handles all the constraints mentioned in the problem description, including the range of `N` and `L` (1 ≤ N, L ≤ 100), and the format of the input strings (lowercase letters of length `L`). Since the problem description specifies that the input will be valid and will not cause errors, the program is robust within these assumptions.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic required to find and print the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by concatenating the given strings in some order.
