#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{18}, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Additionally, p is a list of m distinct integers representing the indices of special items, where 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < … < p_m ≤ n.
def func():
    data = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    n = data[0]
    m = data[1]
    k = data[2]
    nums = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    curr = 0
    offset = 0
    i = 0
    op = 0
    while i < m:
        if nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k:
            while i < m and nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k:
                i += 1
            offset = i
            op += 1
        else:
            curr += (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `data` is `[n, m, k]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `offset` is either `i` or `m` or `0`, `i` is `m` (or `m-1` if `m` is odd), `op` is either `1` or `0`, and `curr` is updated such that:
    #- If `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k` during the last iteration, then `curr` remains unchanged from its value just before the last iteration.
    #- Otherwise, `curr` is updated by adding `(nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k` to its value just before the last iteration.
    print(op)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two lines of user input. The first line contains three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\). The second line contains a list of integers \(nums\) of length \(m\). It then iterates through the list \(nums\) and updates a variable `curr` based on certain conditions. Specifically, it increments a counter `op` each time it encounters a segment of consecutive elements in \(nums\) that fit within a certain range defined by `offset` and `curr * k`. The function ultimately prints the value of `op`, which represents the number of such segments found. The function handles edge cases such as when the input list \(nums\) is empty or when the conditions for updating `curr` are not met.
