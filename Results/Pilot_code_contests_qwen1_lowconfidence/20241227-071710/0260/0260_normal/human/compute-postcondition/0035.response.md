Postcondition: ***`data` is `[n, m, k]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `offset` is either `m` or `0`, `i` is either `m` or `0`, `op` is either `1` or `0`, and `curr` is updated according to the following rules:
- If `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`, then `curr` remains unchanged if it was `0` or updates to `(nums[i] - m - 1) / k` if it was `(nums[i] - 1) / k`.
- Otherwise, `curr` is updated to `(nums[i] - m - 1) / k` if `curr` was `0` or to `((nums[i] - 1) / k - m - 1) / k` if `curr` was `(nums[i] - 1) / k`.***
