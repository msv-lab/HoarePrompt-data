The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is `m`, so after executing `i += 1`, the new value of `i` will be `m + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[0] - 1) / k` depending on whether `nums[0] â‰¤ m + k`, `offset` is either `m` or 0, `i` is `m + 1`, `op` is either 1 or 0.**
