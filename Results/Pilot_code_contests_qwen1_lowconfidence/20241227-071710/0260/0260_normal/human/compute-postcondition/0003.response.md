The code assigns the third element of the list `data` to the variable `k`. The initial state tells us that `n` is the first element of `data`, `m` is the second element of `data`, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n. After the code runs, `k` will take the value of the third element of `data`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `n` is the first element of `data`, `m` is the second element of `data`, `k` is the third element of `data`, and `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers representing the indices of special items, where 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < … < p_m ≤ n.**
