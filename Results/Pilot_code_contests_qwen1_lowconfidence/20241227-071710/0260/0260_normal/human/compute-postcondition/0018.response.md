The code sets the value of `offset` to the value of `i`. According to the initial state, `i` is equal to `m`. Therefore, `offset` is now assigned the value of `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]`, `nums` is a list of integers, `curr` is 0, `offset` is `m`, `i` is `m`, `op` is 0**
