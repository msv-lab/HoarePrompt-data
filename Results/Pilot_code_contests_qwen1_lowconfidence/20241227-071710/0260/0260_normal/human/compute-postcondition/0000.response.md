The code `data = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings using whitespace as the delimiter, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `data`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `p` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `data` based on the user's input and retains the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `p`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of integers obtained from user input, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and p is a list of m distinct integers representing the indices of special items, where 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < … < p_m ≤ n.**
