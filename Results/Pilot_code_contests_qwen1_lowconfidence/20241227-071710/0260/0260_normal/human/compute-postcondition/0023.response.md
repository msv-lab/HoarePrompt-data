Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < m`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `data` is `[n, m, k]` where `m > 0`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input.
   - `curr` is either 0 or \((nums[i] - 1) / k\) depending on whether \(nums[i] \leq offset + curr \cdot k + k\).
   - `offset` is either `m` or 0.
   - `i` is either `m` or 0.
   - `op` is either 1 or 0.

3. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < m` must be true at the start of the next iteration. Given that `i` can only take values of 0 or `m`, the only way for `i < m` to be true is if `i` is currently 0 and `m` is greater than 0 (which it already is as per the given conditions).

4. **State Adjustment**: 
   - Since `i` is either 0 or `m`, and we need `i` to be 0 for the loop to execute one more time, no adjustment is necessary for `i`.
   - We don't need to adjust any other states because the condition `i < m` directly depends on `i` being less than `m`, and `m` is already greater than 0.

Therefore, the state remains the same as provided.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]` where `m > 0`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input; `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[i] - 1) / k` depending on whether `nums[i] \leq offset + curr \cdot k + k`; `offset` is either `m` or 0; `i` is either `m` or 0; `op` is either 1 or 0**
