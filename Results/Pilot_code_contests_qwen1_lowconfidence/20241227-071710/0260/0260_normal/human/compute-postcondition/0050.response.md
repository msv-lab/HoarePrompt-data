The given code prints the value of the variable `op`. Since no other operations are performed on any of the variables, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is the printing of `op`.

Output State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `offset` is either `i` or `m` or `0`, `i` is `m` (or `m-1` if `m` is odd), `op` is printed, and `curr` is updated according to the given conditions.**
