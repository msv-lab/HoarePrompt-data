The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is `m - 1`. After incrementing, the new value of `i` becomes `m - 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `m`.

The states of all other variables remain unchanged: `data` is `[n, m, k]` where `m > 0`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[0] - 1) / k` depending on whether `nums[0] â‰¤ m + k`, `offset` is either `m` or 0, and `op` is either 1 or 0.

Output State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]` where `m > 0`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[0] - 1) / k` depending on whether `nums[0] â‰¤ m + k`, `offset` is either `m` or 0, `i` is `m`, `op` is either 1 or 0**
