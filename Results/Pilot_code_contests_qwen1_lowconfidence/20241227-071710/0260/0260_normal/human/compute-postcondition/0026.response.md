Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the current state step by step:

### Given Loop
```python
while i < m and nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `data` is `[n, m, k]` where `m > 0`
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input
- `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[0] - 1) / k` depending on whether `nums[0] ≤ m + k`
- `offset` is either `m` or 0
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `op` is either 1 or 0

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Condition for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < m` and `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`.

2. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, so now `i = i + 1`.
   - To ensure the loop executes again, `i` must be less than `m`.
   - Additionally, `nums[i]` must be less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `i` was incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m`. This means `i` should be set to a value such that `i < m` holds true.
   - We need to ensure that `nums[i]` (where `i` is the new value of `i`) is less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`.

### Adjusting the States
- **i:** The value of `i` must be set to a value that satisfies `i < m`. In the simplest case, we can set `i` to `m - 1` to ensure the condition is met.
- **nums[i]:** The value of `nums[i]` must be less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`. Since we don't know the exact value of `nums[i]` at this point, we can ensure the condition by making sure `nums[i]` is valid.

### Final Answer
State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]` where `m > 0`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input; `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[0] - 1) / k` depending on whether `nums[0] ≤ m + k`; `offset` is either `m` or 0; `i` is `m - 1`; `op` is either 1 or 0; `nums[i]` must be less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`**
