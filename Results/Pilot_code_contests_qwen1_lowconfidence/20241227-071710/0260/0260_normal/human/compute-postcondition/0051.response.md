The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\). Additionally, the function accepts a parameter `p`, which is a list of `m` distinct integers representing the indices of special items, where \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m \leq n\).

The function does not return anything based on the given output cases. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `p` as described above.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)), `m` (an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\)), `k` (an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\)), and `p` (a list of `m` distinct integers representing the indices of special items, where \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m \leq n\)).**
