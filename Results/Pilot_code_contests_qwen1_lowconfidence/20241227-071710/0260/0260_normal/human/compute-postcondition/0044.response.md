The code `offset = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `offset`. Based on the initial state, `i` is `m` (or `m-1` if `m` is odd). Therefore, `offset` is now equal to `i`, which is `m` (or `m-1` if `m` is odd).

The other variables remain unchanged in their initial state.

Output State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `offset` is `i`, `i` is `m` (or `m-1` if `m` is odd), `op` is either `1` or `0`, and `curr` is set such that all previous conditions `nums[i-2] <= offset + curr * k + k` hold true.**
