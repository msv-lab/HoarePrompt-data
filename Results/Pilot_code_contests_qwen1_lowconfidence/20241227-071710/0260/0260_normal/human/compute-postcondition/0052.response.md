Functionality: **The function processes two lines of user input. The first line contains three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\). The second line contains a list of integers \(nums\) of length \(m\). It then iterates through the list \(nums\) and updates a variable `curr` based on certain conditions. Specifically, it increments a counter `op` each time it encounters a segment of consecutive elements in \(nums\) that fit within a certain range defined by `offset` and `curr * k`. The function ultimately prints the value of `op`, which represents the number of such segments found. The function handles edge cases such as when the input list \(nums\) is empty or when the conditions for updating `curr` are not met.**
