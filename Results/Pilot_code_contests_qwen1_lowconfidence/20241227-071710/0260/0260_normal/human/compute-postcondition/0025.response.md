The value of `i` is incremented by 1, which means `i` is now `i + 1`. The other variables (`data`, `nums`, `curr`, `offset`, `op`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]` where `m > 0`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input; `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[0] - 1) / k` depending on whether `nums[0] \leq m + k`; `offset` is either `m` or 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `op` is either 1 or 0**
