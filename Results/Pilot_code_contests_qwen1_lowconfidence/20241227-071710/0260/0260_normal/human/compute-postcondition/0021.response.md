Let's go through the given code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `data` is `[n, m, k]` where `m > 0`
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input
   - `curr` is 0
   - `offset` is 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `op` is 0
   - `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`

2. Code: 
   ```python
   curr += (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k
   ```

3. Explanation:
   - The current value of `curr` is 0.
   - The expression `(nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k` is evaluated.
     - Since `curr` is 0, `curr * k` is also 0.
     - So, the expression simplifies to `(nums[i] - (0 + 0) - 1) / k` which is `(nums[i] - 1) / k`.
     - Given that `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`, and since `offset` is 0 and `curr * k` is 0, `nums[i] > k`.
   - This means `nums[i] - 1` is a positive integer greater than `k - 1`.
   - Let's denote this value as `v = nums[i] - 1`.
   - Therefore, `curr` is updated to `curr + v / k`.

4. Updated Values:
   - `curr` is now `0 + (nums[i] - 1) / k` which is `(nums[i] - 1) / k`.
   - All other variables (`data`, `nums`, `offset`, `i`, `op`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]` where `m > 0`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input; `curr` is `(nums[i] - 1) / k`; `offset` is 0; `i` is 0; `op` is 0**
