`op` is incremented by 1. The value of `op` was either 1 or 0, so after incrementing, it will be either 2 or 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is `[n, m, k]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[m] - 1) / k` depending on whether `nums[m] â‰¤ m + k`, `offset` is `m`, `i` is `m`, `op` is either 2 or 1.
