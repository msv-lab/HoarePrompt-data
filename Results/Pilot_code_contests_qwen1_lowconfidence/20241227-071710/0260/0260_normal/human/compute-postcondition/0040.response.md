The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` was `2`, so after executing `i += 1`, the new value of `i` is `3`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `offset` is `0`, `i` is `3`, `op` is either `1` or `0`, and `curr` must be set such that `nums[1] <= curr * k + k` holds true.**
