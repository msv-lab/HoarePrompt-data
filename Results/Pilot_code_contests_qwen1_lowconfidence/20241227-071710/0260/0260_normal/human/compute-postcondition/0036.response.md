To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `i < m` and the current values of the variables at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `data` is `[n, m, k]`
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input
- `offset` is either `m` or `0`
- `i` is either `m` or `0`
- `op` is either `1` or `0`
- `curr` is updated based on the conditions provided

The loop condition is `i < m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either `m` or `0`. Since `i` is `m` now, for the loop to continue, `i` must be set to a value less than `m` in the next iteration. The only way to satisfy this condition is to change `i` to `0` (since `i` cannot be less than `0`).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is `0` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `offset` is either `m` or `0`, `i` is `0`, `op` is either `1` or `0`, and `curr` is updated according to the rules provided.**
