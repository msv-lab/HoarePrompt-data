The code `i = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `i`. The value of `i` is now `0`, but none of the other variables (`data`, `nums`, `curr`, `offset`) are affected. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `i` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`data` is [n, m, k], `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0, `i` is 0**
