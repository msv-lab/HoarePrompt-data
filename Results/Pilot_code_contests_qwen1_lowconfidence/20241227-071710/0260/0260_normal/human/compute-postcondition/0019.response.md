`op` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `op` was 0, so the new value of `op` is 1. The states of the other variables (`data`, `nums`, `curr`, `offset`, and `i`) are not affected.

Output State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]`, `nums` is a list of integers, `curr` is 0, `offset` is `m`, `i` is `m`, `op` is 1**
