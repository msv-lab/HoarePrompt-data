Output State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `offset` is either `i` or `m` or `0`, `i` is `m` (or `m-1` if `m` is odd), `op` is either `1` or `0`, and `curr` is updated such that:
- If `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k` during the last iteration, then `curr` remains unchanged from its value just before the last iteration.
- Otherwise, `curr` is updated by adding `(nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k` to its value just before the last iteration.**

This final state indicates that the loop has processed all elements of the list `nums` up to index `m-1` (or `m-2` if `m` is odd), setting `i` to `m` (or `m-1` if `m` is odd). The value of `offset` reflects the position where the list was last fully processed, and `op` counts the number of times the inner condition was met. The variable `curr` retains its value based on the last iteration's conditions.
