The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `offset`. The initial values of `data`, `nums`, and `curr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `data` is [n, m, k], `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0.

Output State: **`data` is [n, m, k], `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0**
