`op` is incremented by 1, changing its value. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is `[n, m, k]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `offset` is `i`, `i` is `m` (or `m-1` if `m` is odd), `op` is `1` (or `0` plus 1, which means `1`), and `curr` is set such that all previous conditions `nums[i-2] <= offset + curr * k + k` hold true.
