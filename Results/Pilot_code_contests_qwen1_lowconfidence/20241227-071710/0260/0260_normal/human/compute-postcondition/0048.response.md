Postcondition: **`data` is `[n, m, k]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `offset` is either `i` or `m` or `0`, `i` is `m` (or `m-1` if `m` is odd), `op` is either `1` or `0`, and `curr` is updated such that if `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`, `curr` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `curr` is updated by adding `(nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k` to its current value.**
