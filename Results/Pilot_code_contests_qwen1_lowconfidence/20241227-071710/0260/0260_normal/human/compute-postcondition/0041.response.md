Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `data` is `[n, m, k]`
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input
- `offset` is `0`
- `i` is `3`
- `op` is either `1` or `0`
- `curr` must satisfy the condition `nums[1] <= curr * k + k`

### Loop Condition
The loop continues as long as:
- `i < m`
- `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`

Given these conditions, let's analyze what needs to change for the loop to continue:

1. **Condition `i < m`:**
   - `i` is currently `3`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `m`.

2. **Condition `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`:**
   - `offset` is `0`, so the condition simplifies to `nums[i] <= curr * k + k`.
   - `i` is currently `3`, so we need to check `nums[3] <= curr * k + k`.

Since `curr` must already satisfy the condition `nums[1] <= curr * k + k`, we need to ensure that the new value of `i` (which would be `4`) also satisfies the same condition:
- `nums[4] <= curr * k + k` must hold true for the loop to continue.

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop executes one more time:
- `i` must be set to `4` (since `i` was `3`).
- The condition `nums[4] <= curr * k + k` must be true.

### Final Answer
State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `offset` is `0`, `i` is `4`, `op` is either `1` or `0`, and `curr` must be set such that `nums[4] <= curr * k + k` holds true.**
