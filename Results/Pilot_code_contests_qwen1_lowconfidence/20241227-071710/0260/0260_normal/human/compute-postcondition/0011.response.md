To ensure that the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to verify the condition inside the loop and adjust the necessary states accordingly.

The condition for the loop to execute is:
\[ i < m \text{ and } nums[i] \leq offset + curr * k + k \]

Given the current state:
- `data` is `[n, m, k]` (where `m > 0`)
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input
- `curr` is 0
- `offset` is 0
- `i` is 0
- `op` is 0
- The current value of `nums[i]` is less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`

Let's break down the condition:

1. **Check `i < m`:**
   - Currently, `i` is 0.
   - `m` is a positive integer (`m > 0`).

   Since `i` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0, the condition `i < m` is already satisfied.

2. **Check `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`:**
   - Currently, `nums[i]` is less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`.
   - Given that `offset` is 0, `curr` is 0, and `k` is a constant, the expression simplifies to:
     \[ nums[0] \leq 0 + 0 * k + k = k \]
   - This condition is also satisfied since `nums[i]` is given as being less than or equal to `k`.

Since both conditions are already satisfied, no adjustments are needed in the states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]` where `m > 0`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0, `i` is 0, `op` is 0, and the current value of `nums[i]` is less than or equal to `k`**
