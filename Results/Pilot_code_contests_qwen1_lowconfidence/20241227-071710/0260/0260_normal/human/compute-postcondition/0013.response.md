To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions under which the loop will continue.

The loop condition is:
\[ \text{while } i < m \text{ and } \text{nums}[i] \leq \text{offset} + \text{curr} \times \text{k} + \text{k} \]

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `data` is `[n, m, k]`
- `nums` is a list of integers
- `curr` is 0
- `offset` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `op` is 0
- The current value of `nums[i]` (which is `nums[1]`) is less than or equal to `k`

For the loop to execute one more time, both parts of the loop condition must hold true:

1. **Condition 1: \( i < m \)**
   - Currently, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `m`.
   - This means `m` must be greater than 1.

2. **Condition 2: \( \text{nums}[i] \leq \text{offset} + \text{curr} \times \text{k} + \text{k} \)**
   - Currently, `nums[1]` is less than or equal to `k`.
   - Since `curr` is 0 and `offset` is 0, the condition simplifies to `nums[1] \leq k`.
   - For the loop to continue, `nums[1]` must still satisfy this condition in the next iteration.
   - However, since `nums[1]` is already less than or equal to `k`, it will still be less than or equal to `0 + 0 \times k + k = k` in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for this part of the condition.

Given these points, the only state that needs adjustment is `m` must be greater than 1.

So, the modified state for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]`, `nums` is a list of integers, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0, `i` is 1, `op` is 0, and `m` must be greater than 1**
