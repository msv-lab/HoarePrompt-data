Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `data` is `[n, m, k]`
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input
   - `offset` is either `m` or `0`
   - `i` is `0`
   - `op` is either `1` or `0`
   - `curr` is updated according to the rules provided
   - `nums[i]` is greater than `offset + curr * k + k`

2. **Code Execution**:
   ```python
   curr += (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:
   - Since `nums[i]` is greater than `offset + curr * k + k`, let's denote `nums[i]` as `num`.
   - Let's also denote `offset + curr * k` as `o_c`.
   - The equation becomes `curr += (num - o_c - 1) / k`.

4. **Update of `curr`**:
   - We know `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`, hence `num - (offset + curr * k + k) - 1 > 0` which simplifies to `num - o_c - 1 > k - 1`.
   - This means `(num - o_c - 1) / k` is a positive value.

5. **Final Value of `curr`**:
   - `curr` is updated by adding `(num - o_c - 1) / k` to its current value.

Given the constraints, the exact numerical values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `nums`, `offset`, and `i` are not specified, but we know the relationship between them. Thus, the final state is:

Output State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `offset` is either `m` or `0`, `i` is `0`, `op` is either `1` or `0`, `curr` is updated by adding `(nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k` to its current value.**
