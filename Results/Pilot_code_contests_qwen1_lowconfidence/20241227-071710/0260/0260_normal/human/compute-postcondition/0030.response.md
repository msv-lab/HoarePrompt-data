Output State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[m] - 1) / k` depending on whether `nums[m] â‰¤ m + k`, `offset` is either `m` or 0, `i` is `m`, `op` is either 1 or 0**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: The initial values of the variables are given, with `m > 0`, `nums` being a list of integers, `curr` and `offset` having specific conditions based on `m` and `nums[0]`, and `i` and `op` having initial values either 0 or specific based on conditions.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < m` and `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`. Given the output states after several iterations, we observe that the loop increments `i` until it reaches `m`.
3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop executes, `i` will be equal to `m`, meaning all elements up to index `m-1` have been processed.
   - The condition `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k` ensures that the loop terminates when `i` reaches `m`.
   - The values of `data`, `nums`, `curr`, `offset`, and `op` do not change within the loop. Therefore, they retain their initial values.
   - `curr` is still dependent on the value of `nums[0]` if `i` started at `m` (which it does in this case).

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop has executed is as described above.
