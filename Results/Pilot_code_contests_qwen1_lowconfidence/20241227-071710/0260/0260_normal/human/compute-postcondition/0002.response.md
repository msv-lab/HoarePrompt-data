The code `m = data[1]` assigns the second element of the list `data` to the variable `m`. Initially, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, after executing this line of code, the value of `m` is updated to the second element of `data`, while `n`, `k`, and `p` retain their original values.

Output State: **`data` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `n` is the first element of `data`, `m` is the second element of `data`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `p` is a list of m distinct integers representing the indices of special items, where 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < … < p_m ≤ n.**
