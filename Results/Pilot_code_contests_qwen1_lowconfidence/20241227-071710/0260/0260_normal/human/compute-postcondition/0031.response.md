The code sets `offset` to the value of `i`. Since `i` is `m`, `offset` is also set to `m`. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[m] - 1) / k` depending on whether `nums[m] â‰¤ m + k`, `offset` is `m`, `i` is `m`, `op` is either 1 or 0**
