Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations have executed.

### Initial State
- `data` is `[n, m, k]`
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input
- `offset` is either `m` or `0`
- `i` is `0`
- `op` is either `1` or `0`
- `curr` is updated according to the rules provided

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```
while i < m and nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k:
    i += 1
```

### Observations from Example Outputs
1. After 1 iteration:
   - `i` is `1`
   - `curr` must satisfy `nums[0] <= offset + curr * k + k`

2. After 2 iterations:
   - `i` is `3`
   - `curr` must satisfy `nums[1] <= curr * k + k`
   - `offset` is `0`

3. After 3 iterations:
   - `i` is `5`
   - `curr` must satisfy `nums[4] <= curr * k + k`
   - `offset` is `0`

From these observations, we can deduce the following pattern:
- Each iteration increments `i` by 2.
- `i` starts at `0` and increases by `2` each time the condition is met.
- `offset` is set to `0` if the loop continues beyond the first iteration.
- `curr` is updated to ensure the condition `nums[i-1] <= offset + curr * k + k` holds true at each step.

### Final State Calculation
Given the pattern, after `m/2` iterations (since `i` increments by 2 each time), `i` will be `m`:
- `i` will be `m` (assuming `m` is even; if `m` is odd, `i` will be `m-1`).
- All conditions for `curr` will have been checked and adjusted accordingly.
- `offset` will be `0` if the loop continues beyond the first iteration.

### Final Values
- `data` remains `[n, m, k]`
- `nums` remains a list of integers obtained from user input
- `offset` is `0`
- `i` is `m` (or `m-1` if `m` is odd)
- `op` is either `1` or `0`
- `curr` is set such that all previous conditions `nums[i-2] <= offset + curr * k + k` hold true

### Output State
Output State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `offset` is `0`, `i` is `m` (or `m-1` if `m` is odd), `op` is either `1` or `0`, and `curr` is set such that all previous conditions `nums[i-2] <= offset + curr * k + k` hold true.**
