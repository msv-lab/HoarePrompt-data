The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The initial value of `i` is 3, so after the increment, `i` will be 4. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]`, `nums` is a list of integers, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0, `i` is 4, `op` is 0, and `nums[3]` must be less than or equal to `k`**
