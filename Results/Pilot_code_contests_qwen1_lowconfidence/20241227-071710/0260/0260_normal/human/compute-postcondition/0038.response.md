The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and no other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `offset` is either `m` or `0`, `i` is `1`, `op` is either `1` or `0`, and `curr` must be set such that `nums[0] <= offset + curr * k + k` holds true.**
