Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The condition for the `while` loop is `i < m and nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`.

2. **Current State Before Loop**:
   - `data` is `[n, m, k]`
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input
   - `offset` is either `m` or `0`
   - `i` is `0`
   - `op` is either `1` or `0`
   - `curr` is updated according to the rules provided

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is `0`
   - Since `i` is `0`, the first condition `i < m` is satisfied (as long as `m` is a positive integer).
   - The second condition `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k` needs to be checked.

4. **First Iteration Check**:
   - `nums[0]` must satisfy `nums[0] <= offset + curr * k + k` for the loop to execute the first time.

5. **Possible Values for `offset` and `curr`**:
   - `offset` is either `m` or `0`.
   - `curr` is updated according to the rules provided, but we don't have specific details about how `curr` is updated in the given information.

6. **Ensuring the Second Condition**:
   - To ensure `nums[0] <= offset + curr * k + k` holds true, we need to adjust either `offset`, `curr`, or both.
   - If `offset` is `0`, then `offset + curr * k + k` simplifies to `curr * k + k`.
   - If `offset` is `m`, then `offset + curr * k + k` becomes `m + curr * k + k`.

### Adjustments Needed:

To make sure the loop executes at least once:
- Ensure `nums[0] <= offset + curr * k + k` holds true.

Given that `i` is `0` and the loop condition is met if `nums[0]` satisfies the inequality, we need to adjust either `offset`, `curr`, or both such that this condition is met.

### Final Answer:

State: **`data` is `[n, m, k]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `offset` is either `m` or `0`, `i` is `0`, `op` is either `1` or `0`, and `curr` must be set such that `nums[0] <= offset + curr * k + k` holds true.**

In practical terms, you would need to update `curr` to a value that satisfies the condition or ensure that `offset` and `curr` are set appropriately based on the values of `nums[0]`, `m`, and `k`.
