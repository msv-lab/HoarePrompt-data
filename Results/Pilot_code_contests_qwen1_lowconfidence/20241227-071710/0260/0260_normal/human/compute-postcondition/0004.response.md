The code `nums = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user, converts each integer to an integer type using the `map` function, and then assigns the resulting list to the variable `nums`. 

Given the initial state where `data` is a list of integers obtained from user input, and `n`, `m`, and `k` are the first, second, and third elements of `data`, respectively, the variable `data` remains unchanged. However, the new list `nums` is created from the input provided.

Since the exact values of the elements in `data` and `nums` depend on the user input, we cannot specify their exact values here. But we know that `nums` is now a list of integers obtained from the user input, and `data` remains as the original list of three integers `[n, m, k]`.

Output State: **`data` is [n, m, k], `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input**
