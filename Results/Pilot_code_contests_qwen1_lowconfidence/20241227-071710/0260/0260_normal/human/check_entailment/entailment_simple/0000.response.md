Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program assumes that the input is read from `raw_input()`. However, in Python 3, the equivalent of `raw_input()` is `input()`. If the program is run in Python 3 without this change, it will raise a `NameError`.

2. **Logic for Determining Special Pages**: The program calculates the number of operations needed to discard the special items. However, the logic for determining the number of operations is flawed. Specifically:
   - The variable `offset` is used incorrectly. `offset` should represent the starting index of the current page, but it is being used to track the current index of the special item list (`nums`).
   - The variable `curr` is used to calculate how many full pages need to be skipped, but the calculation is incorrect. The formula `(nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k` does not correctly determine the number of pages to skip.

3. **Page Calculation**: The program needs to determine which page contains the special item and ensure that all items in that page are considered for discarding. The current logic does not properly handle this.

To correctly implement the solution, the program should:
- Calculate the page number of each special item.
- Track the current page and ensure that all items in the current page are processed before moving to the next page.
- Count the number of operations required to process all special items.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    # Read input values
    data = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = data[0]
    m = data[1]
    k = data[2]
    
    # Read special item indices
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize variables
    page = 1
    op = 0
    
    # Process each special item
    for num in nums:
        # Determine the page number of the current special item
        while num > page * k:
            page += 1
        
        # Increment the operation count as a new operation starts when a new page is encountered
        if page > 1:
            op += 1
    
    print(op)

# Call the function
func()
```

This corrected version properly handles the logic of determining the number of operations required to discard the special items according to the problem description.
