Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a logical error in how it handles the movement and discarding of items across pages. Specifically, the code does not correctly simulate the movement of items when a special item is discarded. Let's consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
10 4 5
3 5 7 10
```

According to the problem description, the process should be as follows:
1. The first page is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and it contains the special items at indices 3 and 5. After discarding these items, the first page becomes [1, 2, 4, 6, 7].
2. The next special item is at index 7, which is still on the first page. After discarding this item, the first page becomes [1, 2, 4, 6].
3. The next special item is at index 10, which is on the second page. After discarding this item, the second page becomes [9].

However, the provided code does not correctly simulate the movement of items after discarding a special item. Instead of correctly updating the positions of items after discarding, it simply increments the `curr` variable, which does not accurately reflect the movement of items to the previous page.

To illustrate the issue, let's run the code with the provided input and see the result:
```python
def func():
    data = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = data[0]
    m = data[1]
    k = data[2]
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    curr = 0
    offset = 0
    i = 0
    op = 0
    while i < m:
        if nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k:
            while i < m and nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k:
                i += 1
            offset = i
            op += 1
        else:
            curr += (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) // k
    print(op)

func()
```

When running the code with the provided input, the output is `3`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `3` based on the problem description, but the code does not correctly simulate the movement of items. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
