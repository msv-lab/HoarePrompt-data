Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the special items are distributed such that they span multiple pages but the program incorrectly calculates the number of operations. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for the movement of items after discarding special items on a page.

Consider the following example:
- Input:
  ```
  15 5 5
  5 10 12 13 15
  ```

Expected output:
- The first page is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the second page is `[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, and the third page is `[11, 12, 13, 14, 15]`.
- Tokitsukaze will first discard the special items at indices 5, 10, 12, and 13.
- After the first operation, the pages become:
  - First page: `[1, 2, 3, 4, _]` (5 moves to the end)
  - Second page: `[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` (12 moves to the second page, 13 moves to the third page)
  - Third page: `[11, 14, 15]` (13 moves to the third page, 12 moves to the second page)
- Tokitsukaze will then discard the special item at index 15 on the third page.
- Output should be `2`.

However, the provided program will output `1` because it does not correctly handle the movement of items after discarding special items on a page and recalculating the current page.
