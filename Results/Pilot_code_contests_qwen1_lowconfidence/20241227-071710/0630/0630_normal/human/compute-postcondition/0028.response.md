The code `break` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since no such loop or switch statement is present in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program would exit the loop or switch it was in. However, since no loop or switch was mentioned in the initial state, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`curr_scores[name]' is the original value of `curr_scores[name]' plus `score', `name` is its original value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
