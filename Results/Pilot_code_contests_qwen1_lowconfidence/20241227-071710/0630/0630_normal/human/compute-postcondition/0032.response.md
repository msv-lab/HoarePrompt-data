Functionality: **The function accepts input consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of player names and scores. It processes these inputs to calculate the final scores of each player and determine the player(s) with the highest score at the end of the game. If multiple players have the same highest score, it prints the first one it encounters. If no player has a positive score, it does not print anything. The function does not return any value.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
1. If all players have a score of zero, the function will not print anything because the condition `if curr_scores[name] >= m and name in winner_candidates:` will never be met.
2. The function assumes that at least one player will have a positive score at the end of the game. If this assumption is violated (i.e., all scores are negative or zero), the function may not behave as expected and might not print anything, which could be considered an edge case.

This summary covers the primary functionality of the function, including its behavior under edge cases and highlights the missing assumption regarding the presence of a player with a positive score.
