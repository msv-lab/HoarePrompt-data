The code `print(name)` simply prints the value of `name`. It does not change the value of `name` or any other variable. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`rounds` is a non-empty list where each element is a sublist containing a string and an integer; `curr_scores` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0; `curr_scores[name]` is the original value of `curr_scores[name]` plus `score`; the value of `name` is printed.**
