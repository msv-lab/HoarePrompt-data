The code `print(name)` simply prints the value of the variable `name`. It does not change the value of `name` or any other variables. The output of the print statement will be the current value of `name`, but this value remains unchanged in the state of the program.

Output State: **`curr_scores[name]' is the original value of `curr_scores[name]' plus `score', `name` is its original value**
