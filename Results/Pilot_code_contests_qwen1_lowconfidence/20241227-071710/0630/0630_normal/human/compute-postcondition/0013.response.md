The code initializes `curr_scores` as a `defaultdict` with a default factory value of `int`. This means that `curr_scores` is a dictionary where the default value for any key that does not yet exist is `0`.

The initial state includes:
- `rounds` is a list of sublists, where each sublist contains a player's name (string) and their score (integer).
- `final_scores` is a dictionary where the key is the player's name and the value is the total score accumulated from all sublists in `rounds`.
- `m` is the maximum value found in `final_scores.values()`.
- `winner_candidates` is a set of players whose scores in `final_scores` match the maximum value `m`.

After executing the line `curr_scores = defaultdict(int)`, the following changes occur:
- A new variable `curr_scores` is introduced and initialized as a `defaultdict` with a default value of `0`.
- The values of the other variables (`rounds`, `final_scores`, `m`, and `winner_candidates`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`rounds` is a list of sublists, where each sublist contains a player's name (string) and their score (integer); `final_scores` is a dictionary where the key is the player's name and the value is the total score accumulated from all sublists in `rounds`; `m` is the maximum value found in `final_scores.values(); winner_candidates` is a set of players whose scores in `final_scores` match the maximum value `m`; `curr_scores` is a defaultdict with a default value of `0`.**
