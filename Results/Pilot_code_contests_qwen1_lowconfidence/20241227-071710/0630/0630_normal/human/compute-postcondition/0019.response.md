Postcondition: ***`rounds` is a non-empty list where each element is a sublist containing a string and an integer; `curr_scores` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0. If `curr_scores[name]` is greater than or equal to `m` and `name` is in `winner_candidates`, then `name` is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
