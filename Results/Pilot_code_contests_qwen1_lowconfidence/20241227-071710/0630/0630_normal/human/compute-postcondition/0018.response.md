The code `break` does not affect any variables but breaks out of the loop or the most internal if statement. Since no specific loop or if statement is mentioned, we assume it breaks out of the loop or the most internal one. 

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`rounds` is a non-empty list where each element is a sublist containing a string and an integer; `curr_scores` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0; `curr_scores[name]` is increased by `score`, and the current value of `curr_scores[name]` is greater than or equal to `m`; `name` is in `winner_candidates`; `name` is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
