Postcondition: **`rounds` is a non-empty list where each element is a sublist containing a string and an integer; `curr_scores` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0. If `curr_scores[name]` is greater than or equal to `m` and `name` is in `winner_candidates`, the value of `name` is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If these conditions are not met, the program does not perform any specific actions related to printing or breaking loops.**
