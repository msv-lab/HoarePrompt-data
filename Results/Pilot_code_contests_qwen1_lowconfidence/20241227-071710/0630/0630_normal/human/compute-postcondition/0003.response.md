The code initializes a dictionary `final_scores` using `defaultdict(int)`. This means that `final_scores` is a dictionary where each key is associated with an integer value, and by default, the value for a new key is `0`.

In the initial state, `rounds` is a list of n sublists, where each sublist contains a player's name (string) and their score (integer). After running the line of code, the variable `final_scores` is updated, but its contents are not specified in the given code snippet.

Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `final_scores` dictionary. The initial state of `rounds` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`rounds` is a list of n sublists, where each sublist contains a player's name (string) and their score (integer); `final_scores` is a defaultdict where each key is associated with an integer value, and the default value for a new key is 0.**
