Output State: **`rounds` is a non-empty list where each element is a sublist containing a string and an integer; `curr_scores` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0; if there exists at least one player whose accumulated score in `curr_scores` is greater than or equal to `m` and that player is in `winner_candidates`, the player's name is printed at least once and the loop breaks; otherwise, the loop does not execute and the variables retain their original values.**
