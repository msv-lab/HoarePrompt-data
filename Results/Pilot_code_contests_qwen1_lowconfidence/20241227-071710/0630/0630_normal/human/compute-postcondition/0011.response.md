The code `m = max(final_scores.values())` assigns the maximum value among the values in the `final_scores` dictionary to the variable `m`. This operation does not change the contents of the `rounds` list or the `final_scores` dictionary except for setting `m` to the maximum value found.

Therefore, the output state remains as follows:
Output State: **`rounds` is a list of sublists, where each sublist contains a player's name (string) and their score (integer); `final_scores` is a dictionary where the key is the player's name and the value is the total score accumulated from all sublists in `rounds`; `m` is the maximum value found in `final_scores.values()`**
