The code `curr_scores[name] += score` increments the value of `curr_scores[name]` by `score`. However, since the initial values of `name` and `score` are not specified, we can only say that `curr_scores[name]` is updated by adding `score` to its current value.

Output State: **`curr_scores[name]' is the original value of `curr_scores[name]' plus `score`.**
