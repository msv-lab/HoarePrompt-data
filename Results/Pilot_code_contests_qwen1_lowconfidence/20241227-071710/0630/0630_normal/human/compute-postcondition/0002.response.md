The code initializes a new list `rounds` where each element is a tuple containing a player's name and their score, with the score converted to an integer. This means that each tuple in the list now has both elements as integers.

Output State: **`rounds` is a list of n sublists, where each sublist contains a player's name (string) and their score (integer)**
