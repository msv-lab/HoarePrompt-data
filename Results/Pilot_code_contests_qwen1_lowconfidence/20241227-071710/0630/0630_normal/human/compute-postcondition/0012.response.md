The code creates a set called `winner_candidates` which includes players whose scores in `final_scores` match the maximum value `m`. The original lists and dictionaries (`rounds`, `final_scores`) are not affected by this operation.

The value of `m` remains unchanged and represents the maximum score in `final_scores`. The `winner_candidates` set is created based on the condition that the score matches `m`.

Output State: **`rounds` is a list of sublists, where each sublist contains a player's name (string) and their score (integer); `final_scores` is a dictionary where the key is the player's name and the value is the total score accumulated from all sublists in `rounds`; `m` is the maximum value found in `final_scores.values(); winner_candidates` is a set of players whose scores in `final_scores` match the maximum value `m`.**
