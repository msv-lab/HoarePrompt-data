The code `n = int(input())` assigns the integer value obtained from user input to the variable `n`. This means `n` is now set to a specific integer value based on the user's input, and the input itself (the number of subsequent lines of data) is consumed. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, the input consists of `n` lines of data each containing a player's name and a score.**
