The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it processes input data where the first line is an integer `n`, indicating the number of players and rounds. Following this, there are `n` lines, each containing a player's name (a string of lower-case Latin letters with the length from 1 to 32) and a score (an integer between -1000 and 1000, inclusive), representing the points gained or lost in each round. The rounds are listed in chronological order, and it is guaranteed that at the end of the game at least one player has a positive number of points.

The function processes this input to determine the player with the highest score at the end of the game and returns the player's name.

Functionality: **The function accepts input consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of player names and scores, and returns the name of the player with the highest score at the end of the game.**
