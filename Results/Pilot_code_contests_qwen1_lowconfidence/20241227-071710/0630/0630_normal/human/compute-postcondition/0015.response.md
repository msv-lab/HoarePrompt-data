The code `curr_scores[name] += score` updates the value of `curr_scores[name]` by adding `score` to the existing value of `curr_scores[name]`. However, the initial state does not specify the specific value of `name` or `score`. The only information provided is that `rounds` is a non-empty list where each element is a sublist containing a string and an integer, and `curr_scores` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0.

Given this, we know that `curr_scores[name]` will be updated, but without knowing the specific values of `name` and `score`, we can only express the update in terms of these variables. The states of the other variables (`rounds`, `final_scores`, `m`, and `winner_candidates`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rounds` is a non-empty list where each element is a sublist containing a string and an integer; `curr_scores` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0; `curr_scores[name]` is increased by `score`.**
