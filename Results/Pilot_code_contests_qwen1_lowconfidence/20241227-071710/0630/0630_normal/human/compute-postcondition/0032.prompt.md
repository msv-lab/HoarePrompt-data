You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer n followed by n lines, each containing a player's name (a string of lower-case Latin letters with the length from 1 to 32) and a score (an integer between -1000 and 1000, inclusive), representing the points gained or lost in each round. The rounds are listed in chronological order, and it is guaranteed that at the end of the game at least one player has a positive number of points.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    rounds = [input().split() for _ in range(n)]
    rounds = [(name, int(score)) for name, score in rounds]
    final_scores = defaultdict(int)
    for (name, score) in rounds:
        final_scores[name] += score
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `rounds` is a list of sublists, where each sublist contains a player's name (string) and their score (integer), `final_scores` is a dictionary where the key is the player's name and the value is the total score accumulated from all sublists in `rounds`.
    m = max(final_scores.values())
    winner_candidates = {player for player, score in final_scores.items() if 
    score == m}
    curr_scores = defaultdict(int)
    for (name, score) in rounds:
        curr_scores[name] += score
        
        if curr_scores[name] >= m and name in winner_candidates:
            print(name)
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `rounds` is a non-empty list where each element is a sublist containing a string and an integer; `curr_scores` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0; if there exists at least one player whose accumulated score in `curr_scores` is greater than or equal to `m` and that player is in `winner_candidates`, the player's name is printed at least once and the loop breaks; otherwise, the loop does not execute and the variables retain their original values.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts input consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of player names and scores, and returns the name of the player with the highest score at the end of the game.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
