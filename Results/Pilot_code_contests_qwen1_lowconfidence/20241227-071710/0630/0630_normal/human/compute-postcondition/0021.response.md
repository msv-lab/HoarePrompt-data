`curr_scores[name]` is incremented by `score`. However, the values of `name` and `score` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `curr_scores[name]`. But we know that the value of `curr_scores[name]` will be the original value plus `score`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rounds` is a non-empty list where each element is a sublist containing a string and an integer; `curr_scores` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0; `curr_scores[name]` is the original value of `curr_scores[name]` plus `score`.**
