`final_scores` is a dictionary that is updated by adding the value of `score` to the existing value of `name` in the dictionary. Since `name` is the name from the first sublist and `score` is the score from the first sublist, the value of `name` and `score` will be used to update the dictionary. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `rounds` is a list that must have at least one sublist, `name` is the name from the first sublist, `score` is the score from the first sublist, `final_scores[name]` is the value of `score` added to the existing value (if any) of `name`.

Output State: **`rounds` is a list that must have at least one sublist, `name` is the name from the first sublist, `score` is the score from the first sublist, `final_scores[name]` is the value of `score` added to the existing value (if any) of `name`**
