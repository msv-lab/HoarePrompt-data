`final_scores` is a dictionary that does not exist in the initial state. The code `final_scores[name] += score` tries to increment the value associated with the key `name` in the `final_scores` dictionary by the value of `score`. Since `final_scores` does not exist initially, it will be created and the value of `score` will be added to the value associated with the key `name`. The states of the other variables (`rounds`, `name`, and `score`) are not affected.

Output State: **`rounds` is a list of at least two sublists, `name` is the name from the second sublist, `score` is the score from the second sublist, `final_scores` is a dictionary with the key `name` and value equal to `score`**
