The input consists of an integer n followed by n lines, each containing a player's name (a string of lower-case Latin letters with the length from 1 to 32) and a score (an integer between -1000 and 1000, inclusive), representing the points gained or lost in each round. The rounds are listed in chronological order, and it is guaranteed that at the end of the game at least one player has a positive number of points.
