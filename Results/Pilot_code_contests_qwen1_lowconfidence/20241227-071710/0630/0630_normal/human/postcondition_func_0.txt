The function accepts input consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of player names and scores. It processes these inputs to calculate the final scores of each player and determine the player(s) with the highest score at the end of the game. If multiple players have the same highest score, it prints the first one it encounters. If no player has a positive score, it does not print anything. The function does not return any value.
