You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The winner of the card game popular in Berland "Berlogging" is determined according to the following rules. If at the end of the game there is only one player with the maximum number of points, he is the winner. The situation becomes more difficult if the number of such players is more than one. During each round a player gains or loses a particular number of points. In the course of the game the number of points is registered in the line "name score", where name is a player's name, and score is the number of points gained in this round, which is an integer number. If score is negative, this means that the player has lost in the round. So, if two or more players have the maximum number of points (say, it equals to m) at the end of the game, than wins the one of them who scored at least m points first. Initially each player has 0 points. It's guaranteed that at the end of the game at least one player has a positive number of points.

Input

The first line contains an integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), n is the number of rounds played. Then follow n lines, containing the information about the rounds in "name score" format in chronological order, where name is a string of lower-case Latin letters with the length from 1 to 32, and score is an integer number between -1000 and 1000, inclusive.

Output

Print the name of the winner.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
import io
import os
import sys
from collections import defaultdict

if sys.version_info[0] < 3:
    from __builtin__ import xrange as range
    from cStringIO import StringIO
    from future_builtins import ascii, filter, hex, map, oct, zip
else:
    from io import BytesIO as StringIO
(sys.stdout, stream) = (io.IOBase(), StringIO())
sys.stdout.flush = lambda : os.write(1, stream.getvalue()) and (not stream.truncate(0)) and stream.seek(0)
sys.stdout.write = stream.write if sys.version_info[0] < 3 else lambda s: stream.write(s.encode())
(input, flush) = (sys.stdin.readline, sys.stdout.flush)
input = StringIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer n followed by n lines, each containing a player's name (a string of lower-case Latin letters with the length from 1 to 32) and a score (an integer between -1000 and 1000, inclusive), representing the points gained or lost in each round. The rounds are listed in chronological order, and it is guaranteed that at the end of the game at least one player has a positive number of points.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    rounds = [input().split() for _ in range(n)]
    rounds = [(name, int(score)) for name, score in rounds]
    final_scores = defaultdict(int)
    for (name, score) in rounds:
        final_scores[name] += score
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `rounds` is a list of sublists, where each sublist contains a player's name (string) and their score (integer), `final_scores` is a dictionary where the key is the player's name and the value is the total score accumulated from all sublists in `rounds`.
    m = max(final_scores.values())
    winner_candidates = {player for player, score in final_scores.items() if 
    score == m}
    curr_scores = defaultdict(int)
    for (name, score) in rounds:
        curr_scores[name] += score
        
        if curr_scores[name] >= m and name in winner_candidates:
            print(name)
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `rounds` is a non-empty list where each element is a sublist containing a string and an integer; `curr_scores` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0; if there exists at least one player whose accumulated score in `curr_scores` is greater than or equal to `m` and that player is in `winner_candidates`, the player's name is printed at least once and the loop breaks; otherwise, the loop does not execute and the variables retain their original values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of player names and scores. It processes these inputs to calculate the final scores of each player and determine the player(s) with the highest score at the end of the game. If multiple players have the same highest score, it prints the first one it encounters. If no player has a positive score, it does not print anything. The function does not return any value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
