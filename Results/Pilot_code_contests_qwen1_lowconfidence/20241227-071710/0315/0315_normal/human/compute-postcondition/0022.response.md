The code `file.flush()` flushes the internal buffer of `file` to the actual device (e.g., disk). However, since `flush` was already set to `True` in the initial state, calling `file.flush()` does not change the value of `flush`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `args` is an empty collection, `sep` is set to `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is an instance of `io.TextIOWrapper` with its content being the original content plus `\n`, `at_start` is `False`, `flush` is `True`**
