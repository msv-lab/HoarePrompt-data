The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function takes an integer `n` representing the number of piranhas in the aquarium, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is the size of the i-th piranha.

The function returns different values based on the conditions given in the problem statement. However, since the specific return values are not detailed in the problem statement, we can only describe the parameters accepted by the function.
