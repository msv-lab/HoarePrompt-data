Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is `n`, and `n` is a positive integer. `f` is 0, and no iteration of the loop has set `f` to 1 and called `func_2(i + 1)` breaking out of the loop. Either `a[i] != m` for all `i`, or for all `i` where `a[i] == m`, neither `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` nor `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` holds true.***
