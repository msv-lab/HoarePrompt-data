The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `args`, `sep`, `file`, and `x`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `args` must be a non-empty collection where each element is a tuple or list containing `(t, n, list_of_piranha_sizes), sep` is set to `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is set to `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout), `at_start` is `False`; the file now contains the string representation of `x`.**
