The function `func_2(i + 1)` is called, which means that the value of `i` is incremented by 1 before calling the function. The variable `i` was previously less than `n`, and now `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from user input, `f` is 0, `m` is the maximum value from the list `a`, and `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1). The current value of `i` is less than `n` and is now equal to `i + 1`, and the element `a[i]` is equal to `m`. Additionally, either `(i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1])` or `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` is true.**
