Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from user input, `f` is 0 since no element in the list `a` satisfies the condition of being a local maximum equal to `m`, `m` is the maximum value from the list `a`, `t` is `t - 1`, and `i` is the index of the last checked element, which is still `n` since no such element was found.***
