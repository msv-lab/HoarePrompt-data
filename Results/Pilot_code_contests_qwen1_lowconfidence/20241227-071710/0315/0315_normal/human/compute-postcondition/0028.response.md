The function `func_2(-1)` is called with `-1` as an argument. The impact of this call is to set `f` to 1 and break out of the loop if certain conditions are met. However, the initial state specifies that no iteration of the loop has set `f` to 1 and called `func_2(i + 1)` breaking out of the loop. Therefore, `func_2(-1)` will set `f` to 1 and break out of the loop.

Since the value of `f` was initially 0, after calling `func_2(-1)`, `f` will be set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer, `f` is 1, `i` is `n`, and `n` is a positive integer. `f` is 1, and no iteration of the loop has set `f` to 1 and called `func_2(i + 1)` breaking out of the loop. Either `a[i] != m` for all `i`, or for all `i` where `a[i] == m`, neither `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` nor `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` holds true.**
