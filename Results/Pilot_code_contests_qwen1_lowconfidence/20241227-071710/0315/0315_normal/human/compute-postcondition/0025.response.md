Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters `t` or `n`, nor does it process a list of piranha sizes. Instead, it accepts a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It prints these arguments to a specified output stream (`file`), separated by a specified separator (`sep`), and appends a specified end character (`end`). If the `flush` argument is set to `True`, it flushes the output stream. After executing, the function leaves `t`, `n`, and `a_i` (if they were present in the input) unchanged, and the output stream contains the concatenated string representations of the input arguments, possibly including separators and end characters. There is no processing of test cases or piranha sizes as implied in the annotations.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If no arguments are passed, the function will not write anything to the output stream.
- If the `flush` argument is set to `True` but no output stream is specified, the function will still attempt to flush the default standard output, which may result in undefined behavior if `sys.stdout` is redirected.
- The function assumes that all elements in `args` are valid for conversion to strings using `str()`. If an element cannot be converted to a string, a `TypeError` will be raised.
