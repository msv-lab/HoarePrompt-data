Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `f` is 0, `i` is `n`, and `m` is the maximum value from the list `a`. If there exists an index `i` such that `a[i] == m` and either `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] > a[i + 1]`, then `func_2(i + 1)` has been called and `f` is set to 1. Otherwise, the loop has completed without any calls to `func_2()` and `f` remains 0.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial Values and Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. The loop checks if the current element `a[i]` is equal to the maximum value `m` in the list `a` and also satisfies the condition of being a local maximum (either greater than its left neighbor or right neighbor).
  
- **Loop Execution**:
  - Each time the loop finds such an index `i` where `a[i] == m` and the condition holds, it calls `func_2(i + 1)` and sets `f` to 1, then breaks out of the loop.
  - If no such index `i` is found during the entire iteration, the loop completes without any calls to `func_2()` and `f` remains 0.
  
- **Final State**:
  - After the loop has executed, `i` will be `n` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n`.
  - `f` will be 1 if there was at least one call to `func_2()`, otherwise, it will be 0.
  - `m` remains the maximum value from the list `a`.

This output state accurately reflects the final values of the variables after all iterations of the loop, considering both the cases where the loop executes and where it does not.
