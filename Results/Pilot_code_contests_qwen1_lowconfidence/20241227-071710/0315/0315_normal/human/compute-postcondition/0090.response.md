Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts `n`, a positive integer representing the number of piranhas, and `a`, a list of `n` positive integers representing the sizes of the piranhas. The function then iterates through each list `a` and checks if there exists a local maximum element (an element that is larger than its immediate neighbors). If such an element is found, it calls `func_2` with the position of this element plus one and sets a flag `f` to 1. If no such element is found in any of the lists, it calls `func_2` with -1 for each test case. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` remains unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `f` is 0 if no local maximum was found or 1 if at least one local maximum was found, `i` is `n` (the length of the current list `a`), and `n` is the number of elements in each list `a`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the list `a` contains only one element, the function will treat this element as a local maximum since it has no neighbors to compare with.
- If the list `a` is empty, the function will skip processing for that test case.
- If the list `a` consists of all identical elements, no local maximum will be found, and `func_2(-1)` will be called.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code does not define or provide any implementation for the `func_2` function. Therefore, the actual behavior when `func_2` is called is unknown. The function could perform any action depending on its implementation.
