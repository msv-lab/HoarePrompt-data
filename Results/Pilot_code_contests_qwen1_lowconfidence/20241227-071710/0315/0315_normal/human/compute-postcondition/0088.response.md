Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases entered by the user, `a` is a list of integers, `f` is 0, `i` is `n`, and `n` is the number of elements in each list `a`. If no element in any of the lists `a` satisfies the condition of being a local maximum equal to `m`, then `f` remains 0 and `func_2(-1)` is called at the end of the loop for each test case. Otherwise, for each list `a`, if there exists an element that is a local maximum (`a[i] == m` and either `i-1 < 0` or `i+1 >= n` or both conditions hold), then `f` is set to 1, `func_2(i + 1)` is called, and the loop breaks.**

This output state captures the final values and relationships of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished executing for all test cases.
