Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer
   - `n` is an integer
   - `args` must be a non-empty collection (one element less than before) where each element is a tuple or list containing `(t, n, list_of_piranha_sizes)`
   - `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`
   - `file` is set to `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`
   - `at_start` is `False`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for x in args:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `args`.
   - Each element in `args` is a tuple or list containing `(t, n, list_of_piranha_sizes)`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one element left in `args`.

4. **Modification Needed:**
   - Since `args` must be a non-empty collection and it is reduced by one element at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `args` should have one less element than it did at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - `t` remains the same as it is not used directly in the loop.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not used directly in the loop.
   - `args` must now be a non-empty collection (two elements less than before) where each element is a tuple or list containing `(t, n, list_of_piranha_sizes)`.
   - `sep` remains the same as it is derived from `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`.
   - `file` remains the same as it is set to `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`.
   - `at_start` changes to `True` because this is the start of the new iteration.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `args` must be a non-empty collection (two elements less than before) where each element is a tuple or list containing `(t, n, list_of_piranha_sizes)`, `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is set to `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, `at_start` is `True`**
