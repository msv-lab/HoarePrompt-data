Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, and `f` is 1 if the condition `i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1] or (i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` is true for the current index `i`. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
