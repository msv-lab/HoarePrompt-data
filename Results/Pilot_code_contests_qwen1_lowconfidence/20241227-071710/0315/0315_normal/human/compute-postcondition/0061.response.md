The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user, converts each string to an integer, and stores them in a list. 

- The initial value of `n` is an integer entered by the user.
- The initial list `a` is a list of integers.
- The initial value of `f` is 1.
- The initial value of `i` is `n`.
- The initial value of `m` is the maximum value from the list `a`.
- The initial value of `t` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1.

After executing the code:

- The value of `a` is updated to a new list of integers obtained from the user input.
- The values of `f`, `i`, `m`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from user input, `f` is 1, `i` is `n`, `m` is the maximum value from the list `a`, and `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1)**
