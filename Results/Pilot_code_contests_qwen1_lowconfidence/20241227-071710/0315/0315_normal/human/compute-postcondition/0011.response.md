Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `args` must be a non-empty collection (one element less than before) where each element is a tuple or list containing `(t, n, list_of_piranha_sizes)`, `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is set to `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, `at_start` is `False`. If `not at_start` is true, `file.write(sep)` has been executed.***
