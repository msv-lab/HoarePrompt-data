The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file object referenced by `file`. Since no new values are assigned to `sep` or `file`, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is that `sep` is written to the file.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `args` must be a non-empty collection where each element is a tuple or list containing `(t, n, list_of_piranha_sizes), `sep` is set to `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is set to `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout), `at_start` is `False`; `sep` is written to the file.**
