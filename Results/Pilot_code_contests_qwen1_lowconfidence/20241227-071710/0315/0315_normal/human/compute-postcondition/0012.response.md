`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file object referenced by `file`. Since `x` is not defined in the given initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, the operation modifies the state of the file by writing the string representation of `x`.

The variable `at_start` is `False`, which means `file.write(sep)` has already been executed before this line. Therefore, this write operation will append the string representation of `x` to whatever was written previously.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `args` must be a non-empty collection (one element less than before) where each element is a tuple or list containing `(t, n, list_of_piranha_sizes)`, `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is set to `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, `at_start` is `False`, `file` now contains the previous content plus `str(x)`.**
