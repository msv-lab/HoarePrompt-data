Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from user input, `f` is 1, `m` is the maximum value from the list `a`, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), the current value of `i` is less than `n` and is now equal to `i + 1`, and the element `a[i]` is equal to `m`. Additionally, either `(i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1])` or `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` is true, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
