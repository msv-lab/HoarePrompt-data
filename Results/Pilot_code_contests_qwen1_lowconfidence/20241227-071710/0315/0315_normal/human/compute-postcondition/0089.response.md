The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters but appears to take inputs through a predefined structure (possibly from user input or a predefined list). It processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer `n` representing the number of piranhas and a list `a` of `n` positive integers representing the sizes of the piranhas. The function does not have a specified return type in the given information.

Based on the information provided:

- The function accepts `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it accepts `n`, a positive integer representing the number of piranhas.
- It also accepts `a`, a list of `n` positive integers representing the sizes of the piranhas.

Given the lack of specific return details, we can only describe the input structure.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts `n`, a positive integer representing the number of piranhas, and `a`, a list of `n` positive integers representing the sizes of the piranhas.**
