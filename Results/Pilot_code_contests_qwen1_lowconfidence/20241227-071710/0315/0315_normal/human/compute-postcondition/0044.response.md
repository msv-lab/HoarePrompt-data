The function `func_2(i + 1)` is called, where `i` is an index in the list `a`. However, the specific value of `i` is not provided, and the function call itself does not change the values of `n` or `a`. The conditions related to `a` remain unchanged because the function call does not modify the list `a` or the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, and for all `i` in the range 0 to `n-1`, the condition `a[i] == m` and either `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] > a[i + 1]` does not hold; `func_2(i + 1)` has been called.**
