Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer entered by the user; `a` is a list of integers; `f` is 1; `m` is the maximum value from the list `a`; `t` is `t - 1`; if `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` is true, then `i` is increased by 3; otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.***
