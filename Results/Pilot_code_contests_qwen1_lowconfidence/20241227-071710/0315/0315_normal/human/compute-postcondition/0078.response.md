Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the key variables and their initial states:**
   - `n` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `a` is a new list of integers obtained from user input.
   - `f` is 1.
   - `m` is the maximum value from the list `a`.
   - `t` is greater than 0 and it is decremented by 1 after each iteration.
   - The current value of `i` is less than `n`.
   - The element `a[i]` is equal to `m`.
   - After executing the if-else block, if the condition `(i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1])` or `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` is met, `i` is now equal to `i + 3`. If the condition is not met, `i` remains unchanged.

2. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration:**
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - Since `t` is decremented by 1 after each iteration, `t` will be `t - 1`.
   - If the condition `(i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1])` or `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` is met, `i` will be updated to `i + 3`. Otherwise, `i` will remain the same.
   - `f` remains unchanged.
   - `m` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

3. **Formulate the new state for the next iteration:**
   - `t` is decremented by 1, so `t` becomes `t - 1`.
   - `i` may change based on the condition mentioned above. It could be `i + 3` if the condition is met, or it could remain `i` if the condition is not met.
   - All other variables (`n`, `a`, `f`, `m`) remain the same.

Given these points, we can write the new state as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from user input, `f` is 1, `m` is the maximum value from the list `a`, `t` is `t - 1`, the current value of `i` is less than `n`, and the element `a[i]` is equal to `m`. Additionally, if the condition `(i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1])` or `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` is met, `i` is now equal to `i + 3`. If the condition is not met, `i` remains unchanged.**

To summarize the specific values for the next iteration:

State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from user input, `f` is 1, `m` is the maximum value from the list `a`, `t` is `t - 1`, the current value of `i` is `i + 3` if the condition is met, otherwise `i` remains unchanged, and the element `a[i]` is equal to `m`.**
