According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over each index from 0 to `n-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- If there exists an index `i` such that `a[i] == m` and either `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] > a[i + 1]`, then `func_2(i + 1)` is called with `i + 1` as an argument, `f` is set to 1, and the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, none of the conditions that would cause the loop to break should be met during this iteration. Specifically, we need to ensure that no index `i` within the current range (from 0 to `n-1`) satisfies the condition where `a[i] == m` and either `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] > a[i + 1]`.

Since the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`, and if the loop condition is not broken, it means that for all `i` in this range, the condition is not satisfied.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, and for all `i` in the range 0 to `n-1`, the condition `a[i] == m` and either `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] > a[i + 1]` does not hold.**
