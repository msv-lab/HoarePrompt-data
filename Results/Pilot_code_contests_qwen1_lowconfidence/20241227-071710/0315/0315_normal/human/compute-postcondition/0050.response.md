`func_2(i + 1)` is called. This function call impacts the value of `i` since `i` is incremented by 1 before calling the function. The function call itself does not directly modify any variables, but it may change the state through its internal operations. However, without knowing the internal operations of `func_2`, we can only say that `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, and for all `i` in the range 0 to `n-1`, the condition `a[i] == m` and either `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] > a[i + 1]` does not hold; `i` is incremented by 1.**
