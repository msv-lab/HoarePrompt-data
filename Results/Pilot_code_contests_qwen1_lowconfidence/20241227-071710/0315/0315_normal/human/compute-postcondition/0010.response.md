The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to `file`. The value of `sep` was previously defined as `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, which means `sep` is either the value provided in `kwargs` for the key `'sep'` or the string `' '` if no such key exists. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `args` must be a non-empty collection (one element less than before) where each element is a tuple or list containing `(t, n, list_of_piranha_sizes)`, `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is set to `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, `at_start` is `False`, `file.write(sep)` has been executed**
