The code `f = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `f`. The value of `f` was previously set to 1 based on the initial state, and now it remains unchanged. All other variables are unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from user input, `f` is 1, `m` is the maximum value from the list `a`, `t` is `t - 1`, `i` is increased by 3, `func_2(i + 1)` is called**
