To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the structure of the loop.

### Given Information:
- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: An integer representing the number of piranhas in the aquarium.
- For each test case, a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is the size of the i-th piranha.
- `sep` is set to `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`.
- `file` is set to `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`.
- `at_start` is `True`.

### Loop Structure:
```
for x in args:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding the `args` Parameter**:
   - The `args` parameter in a function call can be a tuple or a list.
   - The loop iterates over the elements in `args`.

2. **Determine What `args` Contains**:
   - Based on the context provided, `args` likely contains multiple arguments for processing test cases.
   - Each element of `args` should be a test case.
   - A test case typically consists of the number of test cases (`t`), the number of piranhas (`n`), and a list of sizes of the piranhas.

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `args`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `args` is non-empty.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
   - `n` is an integer representing the number of piranhas in the aquarium.
   - A list of `n` integers representing the sizes of the piranhas.
   - `sep` is set to `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`.
   - `file` is set to `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`.
   - `at_start` is `True`.

2. **Adjusting the State**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `args` must contain at least one element (test case).
   - Each test case should be a tuple or list containing `(t, n, list_of_piranha_sizes)`.

### Final State:
- We need to adjust the state such that `args` is a non-empty collection, and each element of `args` is a valid test case.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `args` must be a non-empty collection where each element is a tuple or list containing `(t, n, list_of_piranha_sizes), sep` is set to `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is set to `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout), at_start` is `True`**.
