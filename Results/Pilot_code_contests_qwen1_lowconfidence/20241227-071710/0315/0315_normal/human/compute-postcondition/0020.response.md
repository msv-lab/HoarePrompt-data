The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` impacts the `file` variable by writing the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to it. The value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` is `\n` because `end` is not specified in `kwargs`, and the default value is `\n`.

The `file` variable gets written to with `\n`, but its content type (collection) and reference remain the same. Other variables (`t`, `n`, `args`, `sep`, `at_start`) are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `args` is an empty collection, `sep` is set to `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is an instance of `io.TextIOWrapper` with its content being the original content plus `\n`, `at_start` is `False`.**
