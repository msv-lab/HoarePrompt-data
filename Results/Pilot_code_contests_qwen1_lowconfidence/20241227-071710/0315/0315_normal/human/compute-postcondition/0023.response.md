Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `args` is an empty collection, `sep` is set to `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is an instance of `io.TextIOWrapper` with its content being the original content plus `\n`, `at_start` is `False`. If `flush` is `True`, the function flushes the contents of `file`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
