Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is `n`, and `n` is a positive integer. If no iteration of the loop sets `f` to 1 and calls `func_2(i + 1)` breaking out of the loop, then `f` remains 0. For every index `i` where `a[i] == m`, neither `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` nor `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` holds true.**
