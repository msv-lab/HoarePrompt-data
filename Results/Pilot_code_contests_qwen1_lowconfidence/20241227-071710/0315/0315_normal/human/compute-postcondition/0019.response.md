Output State: **`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `args` is an empty collection, `sep` is set to `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is set to `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout); `at_start` is `False`. The file contains the concatenation of string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: Initially, `args` is a non-empty collection containing tuples/lists of the form `(t, n, list_of_piranha_sizes)`. Each iteration of the loop processes one element of `args`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs as long as `args` is not empty.
   - For each element `x` in `args`, the loop writes `x` to the file using `str(x)`.
   - The `sep` is written to the file between the elements if `at_start` is `False`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all elements in `args` have been processed, `args` becomes an empty collection.
   - `at_start` remains `False` because the last write operation in the loop sets it to `False`.
   - The file contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args`, with `sep` separating them as required.

4. **No Loop Execution**:
   - If `args` is empty initially, the loop does not execute, and `at_start` remains `True`.
   - In this case, the file remains unchanged, and `sep` and `file` retain their initial values.

Thus, the final state after all iterations of the loop (or no iterations if `args` is empty initially) is described as above.
