The given code snippet does not contain any executable statements that modify the variables. It is a comment indicating that the function prints values to a stream or by default to `sys.stdout`. Therefore, no changes are made to the variables `t` or `n`, and no new variables are defined.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` is an integer representing the number of piranhas in the aquarium, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is the size of the i-th piranha.**
