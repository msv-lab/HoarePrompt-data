The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. However, the value of `sep` itself does not change; it is just written to the file. The state of `sep` remains unchanged, and the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`sep` is unchanged, the value of `sep` is written to the file**
