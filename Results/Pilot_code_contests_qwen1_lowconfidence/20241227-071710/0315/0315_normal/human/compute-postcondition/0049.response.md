According to the given for loop, the loop variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers
- For all `i` in the range 0 to `n-1`, the condition `a[i] == m` and either `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] > a[i + 1]` does not hold.
- If the condition `i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1] or (i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` is true, `func_2(i + 1)` has been called and `f` is set to 1. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 and ensure the loop condition is still met. Since the loop continues as long as `i < n`, the new value of `i` should be `i + 1`. 

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was less than `n`.
2. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
3. The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`, so `i + 1` must still be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `n` is greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `a` is a list of integers (unchanged)
- For all `i` in the range 0 to `n-1`, the condition `a[i] == m` and either `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] > a[i + 1]` does not hold (this condition applies for `i + 1` instead of `i`)
- If the condition `i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1] or (i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` is true for `i + 1`, `func_2(i + 2)` has been called and `f` is set to 1. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, and for all `i` in the range 0 to `n-1`, the condition `a[i] == m` and either `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] > a[i + 1]` does not hold. If the condition `i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1] or (i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` is true for `i + 1`, `func_2(i + 2)` has been called and `f` is set to 1. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.**
