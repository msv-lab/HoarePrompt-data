The `break` statement does not change the values of variables but instead exits the loop or conditional block it is within. Given the precondition and the fact that no further operations are specified after the `break` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from user input, `f` is 1, `m` is the maximum value from the list `a`, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), the current value of `i` is less than `n` and is now equal to `i + 1`, and the element `a[i]` is equal to `m`. Additionally, either `(i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1])` or `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` is true, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
