The function `func_2(i + 1)` is called with the argument `i + 1`. However, the function `func_2` itself is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we cannot determine its exact impact on the variables. But we can still update the values of the variables that are known to be affected by the given code.

- `i` is updated by adding 3 to its current value if the condition is met (though the condition is not specified, we assume it is met since the task does not specify otherwise).
- The function call `func_2(i + 1)` does not change the values of `n`, `a`, `f`, `m`, or `t`.

Given the precondition:
- `n` is an integer entered by the user.
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from user input.
- `f` is 1.
- `m` is the maximum value from the list `a`.
- `t` is `t - 1`.
- The current value of `i` is `i + 3` if the condition is met, otherwise `i` remains unchanged.
- The element `a[i]` is equal to `m`.

After the code is executed:
- `i` is increased by 3.
- `func_2(i + 1)` is called.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from user input, `f` is 1, `m` is the maximum value from the list `a`, `t` is `t - 1`, `i` is increased by 3, `func_2(i + 1)` is called.**
