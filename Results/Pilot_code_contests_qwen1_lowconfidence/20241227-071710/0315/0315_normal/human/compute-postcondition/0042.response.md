Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers. If there exists an index `i` such that `a[i] == m` and either `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] > a[i + 1]`, then `func_2(i + 1)` is called with `i + 1` as an argument, `f` is 1, and the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.***
