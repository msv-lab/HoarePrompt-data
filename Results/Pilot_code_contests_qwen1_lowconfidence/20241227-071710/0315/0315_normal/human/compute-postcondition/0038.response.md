The function `func_2(i + 1)` is called, which means the value of `i + 1` is passed as an argument to `func_2`. The value of `i` is unchanged from its initial state, and the other variables (`n` and `a`) are also unaffected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, there exists an index `i` such that the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `m`. Additionally, the value of `a[i]` is greater than either `a[i - 1]` (if `i - 1 >= 0`) or `a[i + 1]` (if `i + 1 < n`); `func_2(i + 1)` is called with `i + 1` as an argument.**
