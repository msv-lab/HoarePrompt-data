According to the given for loop statement, the loop runs `t` times. The loop body is omitted, but we know that if no iteration of the loop sets `f` to 1 and calls `func_2(i + 1)`, then `f` remains 0. Additionally, for every index `i` where `a[i] == m`, neither `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` nor `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` holds true.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `x` is an integer.
- `f` is an integer, and it remains 0 because no iteration of the loop set `f` to 1 and called `func_2(i + 1)`.
- `i` is `n`, indicating the loop has reached its final iteration.
- `n` is a positive integer.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 1 (since the loop has not yet started or completed its full cycle). Since `i` is equal to `n`, it means the loop has completed its current iteration and is ready to start the next one.

Thus, we need to adjust the state as follows:
- `t` must be at least 1 (it should be `t - 1` if it was previously `t`).
- `i` will be reset to 0 for the next iteration.
- `f` remains 0 because the condition that sets `f` to 1 and calls `func_2(i + 1)` has not been met.

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer, `f` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and `t` is at least 1**
