The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the loop or the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, there exists an index `i` such that the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `m`; `a[i]` is greater than either `a[i - 1]` (if `i - 1 >= 0`) or `a[i + 1]` (if `i + 1 < n`); `func_2(i + 1)` is called with `i + 1` as an argument; `f` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
