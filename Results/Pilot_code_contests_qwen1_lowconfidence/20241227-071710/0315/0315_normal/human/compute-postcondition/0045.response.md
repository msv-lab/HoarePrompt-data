The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `f`. No other changes are made to the variables `n` or `a`. The function call `func_2(i + 1)` is also unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, and for all `i` in the range 0 to `n-1`, the condition `a[i] == m` and either `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] > a[i + 1]` does not hold; `func_2(i + 1)` has been called; `f` is 1**
