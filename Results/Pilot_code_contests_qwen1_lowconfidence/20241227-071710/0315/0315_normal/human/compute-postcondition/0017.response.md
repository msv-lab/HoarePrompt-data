The code snippet `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. This operation does not affect the values of `sep` or `at_start`. The only change is that if `not at_start` is `True`, the value of `sep` will be written to the file.

Output State: **`sep` is unchanged. If `not at_start` is true, the value of `sep` is written to the file; the string representation of `x` is written to the file.**
