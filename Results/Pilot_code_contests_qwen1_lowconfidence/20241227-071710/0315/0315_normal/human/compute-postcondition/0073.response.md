The function `func_2(i + 1)` is called with the argument `i + 1`. Since the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we can only update the value of `i` which is set to `i + 2` before the function call. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 due to the function call. 

Given that the initial value of `i` is less than `n` and is now equal to `i + 2`, after the function call, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i + 3`.

Other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from user input, `f` is 1, `m` is the maximum value from the list `a`, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), the current value of `i` is less than `n` and is now equal to `i + 3`, and the element `a[i]` is equal to `m`. Additionally, either `(i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1])` or `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` is true.**
