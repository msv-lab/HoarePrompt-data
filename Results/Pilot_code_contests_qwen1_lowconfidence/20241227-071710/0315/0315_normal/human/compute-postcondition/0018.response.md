`at_start` is assigned the value `False`. The value of `sep` remains unchanged, and the condition for writing `sep` to the file and the string representation of `x` to the file depends on the value of `not at_start`. Since `at_start` is now `False`, the condition `not at_start` is `True` only if `not_start` was `True` in the initial state. Therefore, if `not_start` was `True`, `sep` will be written to the file and the string representation of `x` will be written to the file. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `sep` is unchanged, if `not_start` was `True` then `sep` is written to the file and the string representation of `x` is written to the file.**
