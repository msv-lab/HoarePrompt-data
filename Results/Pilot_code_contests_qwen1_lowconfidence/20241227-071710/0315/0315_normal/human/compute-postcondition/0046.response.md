The code `break` is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it means that the function or loop it is inside is being exited. However, the given initial state does not specify which loop or conditional block this `break` statement belongs to. Since no other changes are made to the variables `n`, `a`, `func_2(i + 1)`, or `f`, these variables remain unchanged.

The output state remains as follows:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers, and for all `i` in the range 0 to `n-1`, the condition `a[i] == m` and either `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] > a[i + 1]` does not hold
- `func_2(i + 1)` has been called
- `f` is 1

Since the `break` statement does not modify any of these conditions or variables, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, and for all `i` in the range 0 to `n-1`, the condition `a[i] == m` and either `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] > a[i + 1]` does not hold; `func_2(i + 1)` has been called; `f` is 1**
