Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `f` is 0, `i` is `n`, and `m` is the maximum value from the list `a`. If there exists an index `i` such that `a[i] == m` and either `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] > a[i + 1]`, then `func_2(i + 1)` has not been called and `f` remains 0.***
