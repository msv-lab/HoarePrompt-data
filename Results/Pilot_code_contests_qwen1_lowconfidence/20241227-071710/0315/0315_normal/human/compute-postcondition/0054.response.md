Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, and for all `i` in the range 0 to `n-1`, the condition `a[i] == m` and either `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] > a[i + 1]` does not hold. If the condition `i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1] or (i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` is true for the current index `i + 1`, `func_2(i + 2)` has been called and `f` is set to 1. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
