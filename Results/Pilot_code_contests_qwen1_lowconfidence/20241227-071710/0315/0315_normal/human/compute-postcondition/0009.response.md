Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer
   - `n` is an integer
   - `args` must be a non-empty collection where each element is a tuple or list containing `(t, n, list_of_piranha_sizes)`
   - `sep` is set to `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`
   - `file` is set to `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`
   - `at_start` is `False`
   - The file now contains the string representation of `x`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for x in args:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `args`.
   - Since `args` is a non-empty collection and we need to adjust the state for the next iteration, there should be at least one element left in `args`.
   - Each element in `args` is a tuple or list containing `(t, n, list_of_piranha_sizes)`.
   - After processing each element in the loop, the variable `x` holds the current element from `args`.

4. **Next Iteration State:**
   - Since `x` is the current element being processed, after the first iteration, `x` will hold the first element from `args`.
   - For the next iteration, `x` will be the second element in `args`.
   - Therefore, `args` will be reduced by one element, meaning it now contains one less element than before.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `t` remains an integer
   - `n` remains an integer
   - `args` must be a non-empty collection (one element less than before) where each element is a tuple or list containing `(t, n, list_of_piranha_sizes)`
   - `sep` remains unchanged as `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`
   - `file` remains unchanged as `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`
   - `at_start` remains `False` (since we are not at the start of the loop)

6. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `args` now contains a non-empty collection with one less element than before.
   - `x` will be the second element from the original `args`.

Therefore, the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop are:

State: **`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `args` must be a non-empty collection (one element less than before) where each element is a tuple or list containing `(t, n, list_of_piranha_sizes)`, `sep` is set to `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is set to `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, `at_start` is `False`**.
