`at_start` is assigned the value `False`. This changes the value of `at_start`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `args` must be a non-empty collection (one element less than before) where each element is a tuple or list containing `(t, n, list_of_piranha_sizes)`, `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is set to `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, `at_start` is `False`.
