Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is `n`, and `n` is a positive integer. If during any iteration of the loop, `a[i] == m` and either `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])`, then `f` is set to 1, and the function `func_2(i + 1)` is called, breaking out of the loop. If no such iteration exists, `f` remains 0, and the loop terminates.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `t` is the number of test cases, which is greater than 0.
   - `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
   - `f` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `a[i]` equals `m`.
     - If `a[i] == m`, it further checks whether `a[i]` is greater than its adjacent elements:
       - `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])`.
     - If both conditions are met, it calls `func_2(i + 1)` and sets `f` to 1, then breaks out of the loop.
     - If neither condition is met, it continues to the next iteration.

3. **Final State**:
   - If the loop completes without finding an element `a[i]` that meets the specified conditions, `f` remains 0.
   - Regardless of whether the loop executes or not, `i` will be `n` when the loop exits.
   - `a`, `x`, and `f` retain their final values determined by the loop's execution.

Thus, the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished is as described above.
