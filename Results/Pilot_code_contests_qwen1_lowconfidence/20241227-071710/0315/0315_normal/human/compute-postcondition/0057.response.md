The function `func_2(-1)` is called. Since the initial state does not specify what `func_2` does, and no changes to variables are directly made by calling `func_2(-1)`, the only thing that happens is the function call itself. The precondition that `func_2(i + 1)` has not been called if there exists an index `i` such that `a[i] == m` and either `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] > a[i + 1]` remains unchanged. The value of `f` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `f` is 0, `i` is `n`, and `m` is the maximum value from the list `a`. `func_2(-1)` has been called.**
