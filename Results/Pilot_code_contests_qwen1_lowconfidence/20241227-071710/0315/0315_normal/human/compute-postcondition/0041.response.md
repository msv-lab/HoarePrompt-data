Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, there exists an index `i` such that the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `m`; if `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or if `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] > a[i + 1]`, then `func_2(i + 1)` is called with `i + 1` as an argument, `f` is 1, and the loop or if statement is broken. If the condition is not met, the postcondition remains unchanged.***
