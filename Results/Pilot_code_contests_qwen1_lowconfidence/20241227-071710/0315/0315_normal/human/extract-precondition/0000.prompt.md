You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: There are n piranhas with sizes a_1, a_2, …, a_n in the aquarium. Piranhas are numbered from left to right in order they live in the aquarium.

Scientists of the Berland State University want to find if there is dominant piranha in the aquarium. The piranha is called dominant if it can eat all the other piranhas in the aquarium (except itself, of course). Other piranhas will do nothing while the dominant piranha will eat them.

Because the aquarium is pretty narrow and long, the piranha can eat only one of the adjacent piranhas during one move. Piranha can do as many moves as it needs (or as it can). More precisely: 

  * The piranha i can eat the piranha i-1 if the piranha i-1 exists and a_{i - 1} < a_i. 
  * The piranha i can eat the piranha i+1 if the piranha i+1 exists and a_{i + 1} < a_i. 



When the piranha i eats some piranha, its size increases by one (a_i becomes a_i + 1).

Your task is to find any dominant piranha in the aquarium or determine if there are no such piranhas.

Note that you have to find any (exactly one) dominant piranha, you don't have to find all of them.

For example, if a = [5, 3, 4, 4, 5], then the third piranha can be dominant. Consider the sequence of its moves: 

  * The piranha eats the second piranha and a becomes [5, \underline{5}, 4, 5] (the underlined piranha is our candidate). 
  * The piranha eats the third piranha and a becomes [5, \underline{6}, 5]. 
  * The piranha eats the first piranha and a becomes [\underline{7}, 5]. 
  * The piranha eats the second piranha and a becomes [\underline{8}]. 



You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of piranhas in the aquarium. The second line of the test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the size of the i-th piranha.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5 (∑ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).

Output

For each test case, print the answer: -1 if there are no dominant piranhas in the aquarium or index of any dominant piranha otherwise. If there are several answers, you can print any.

Example

Note

The first test case of the example is described in the problem statement.

In the second test case of the example, there are no dominant piranhas in the aquarium.

In the third test case of the example, the fourth piranha can firstly eat the piranha to the left and the aquarium becomes [4, 4, 5, 4], then it can eat any other piranha in the aquarium.
