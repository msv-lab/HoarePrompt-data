Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify a dominant piranha according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if a piranha can be dominant by looking at its immediate neighbors and whether it is the maximum size in the array. However, this approach is flawed because it does not simulate the eating process over multiple moves.

Here is an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
5
5 3 4 4 5
```

According to the problem description, the third piranha (index 2) can become dominant through the following steps:
1. Eat the second piranha: `a` becomes `[5, 5, 4, 5]`.
2. Eat the third piranha: `a` becomes `[5, 6, 5]`.
3. Eat the first piranha: `a` becomes `[7, 5]`.
4. Eat the second piranha: `a` becomes `[8]`.

However, the current implementation of `func_1` would incorrectly return `-1` because it only checks once if the third piranha can eat its neighbor and does not simulate the eating process over multiple moves.

To fix this, the program needs to simulate the eating process iteratively until no more moves are possible and check if any piranha becomes larger than all others.
