You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n piranhas with sizes a_1, a_2, …, a_n in the aquarium. Piranhas are numbered from left to right in order they live in the aquarium.

Scientists of the Berland State University want to find if there is dominant piranha in the aquarium. The piranha is called dominant if it can eat all the other piranhas in the aquarium (except itself, of course). Other piranhas will do nothing while the dominant piranha will eat them.

Because the aquarium is pretty narrow and long, the piranha can eat only one of the adjacent piranhas during one move. Piranha can do as many moves as it needs (or as it can). More precisely: 

  * The piranha i can eat the piranha i-1 if the piranha i-1 exists and a_{i - 1} < a_i. 
  * The piranha i can eat the piranha i+1 if the piranha i+1 exists and a_{i + 1} < a_i. 



When the piranha i eats some piranha, its size increases by one (a_i becomes a_i + 1).

Your task is to find any dominant piranha in the aquarium or determine if there are no such piranhas.

Note that you have to find any (exactly one) dominant piranha, you don't have to find all of them.

For example, if a = [5, 3, 4, 4, 5], then the third piranha can be dominant. Consider the sequence of its moves: 

  * The piranha eats the second piranha and a becomes [5, \underline{5}, 4, 5] (the underlined piranha is our candidate). 
  * The piranha eats the third piranha and a becomes [5, \underline{6}, 5]. 
  * The piranha eats the first piranha and a becomes [\underline{7}, 5]. 
  * The piranha eats the second piranha and a becomes [\underline{8}]. 



You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of piranhas in the aquarium. The second line of the test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the size of the i-th piranha.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5 (∑ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).

Output

For each test case, print the answer: -1 if there are no dominant piranhas in the aquarium or index of any dominant piranha otherwise. If there are several answers, you can print any.

Example

Input


6
5
5 3 4 4 5
3
1 1 1
5
4 4 3 4 4
5
5 5 4 3 2
3
1 1 2
5
5 4 3 5 5


Output


3
-1
4
3
3
1

Note

The first test case of the example is described in the problem statement.

In the second test case of the example, there are no dominant piranhas in the aquarium.

In the third test case of the example, the fourth piranha can firstly eat the piranha to the left and the aquarium becomes [4, 4, 5, 4], then it can eat any other piranha in the aquarium.

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts a parameter `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts `n`, a positive integer representing the number of piranhas, and `a`, a list of `n` positive integers representing the sizes of the piranhas. The function then iterates through each list `a` and checks if there exists a local maximum element (an element that is larger than its immediate neighbors). If such an element is found, it calls `func_2` with the position of this element plus one and sets a flag `f` to 1. If no such element is found in any of the lists, it calls `func_2` with -1 for each test case. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` remains unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `f` is 0 if no local maximum was found or 1 if at least one local maximum was found, `i` is `n` (the length of the current list `a`), and `n` is the number of elements in each list `a`.

''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function does not accept any parameters `t` or `n`, nor does it process a list of piranha sizes. Instead, it accepts a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It prints these arguments to a specified output stream (`file`), separated by a specified separator (`sep`), and appends a specified end character (`end`). If the `flush` argument is set to `True`, it flushes the output stream. After executing, the function leaves `t`, `n`, and `a_i` (if they were present in the input) unchanged, and the output stream contains the concatenated string representations of the input arguments, possibly including separators and end characters. There is no processing of test cases or piranha sizes as implied in the annotations.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
