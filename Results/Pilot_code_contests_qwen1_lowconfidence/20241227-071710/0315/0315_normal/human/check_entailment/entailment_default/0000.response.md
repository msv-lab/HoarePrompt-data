Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find a dominant piranha. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks for a local maximum element (an element that is larger than its immediate neighbors) but does not ensure that this element can continue to eat adjacent smaller piranhas until it is the only piranha left in the aquarium. The code only checks once whether a local maximum exists and does not simulate the eating process.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5
5 3 4 4 5
```

The third piranha (size 4) is a local maximum, and according to the code, it would be printed as the dominant piranha. However, the third piranha cannot eat the second piranha (size 3) directly because it is not greater than the second piranha. The correct logic should simulate the eating process to ensure that the piranha can continue to grow by eating smaller adjacent piranhas until it is the only one left.

The provided code does not handle this simulation and hence does not correctly identify the dominant piranha in all cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
