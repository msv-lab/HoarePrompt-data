Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the following issues exist:

1. **Function `func_2` Implementation**:
   - The function `func_2` is defined but not utilized correctly within the main logic of the program. The function is intended to print the result, but it does not actually do so. Instead, it takes arguments but does not use them in the context of the problem.
   - In the `for` loop where the dominant piranha is determined, `func_2(i + 1)` is called, which should ideally print the index of the dominant piranha. However, `func_2` is defined to take positional arguments and keyword arguments, and it does not handle the expected output correctly.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Dominant Piranha**:
   - The program checks if a piranha can be dominant by ensuring it is the maximum size among its neighbors. If such a piranha is found, it calls `func_2(i + 1)` to print the index. However, `func_2` is not designed to handle this scenario correctly.
   - To fix this, the function should directly print the index of the dominant piranha instead of using an auxiliary function.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The program should output `-1` if no dominant piranha is found and the index of any dominant piranha otherwise. The current implementation does not ensure that the output is formatted correctly for each test case.

### Corrected Implementation:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        m = max(a)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == m:
                if i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1] or i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1]:
                    print(i + 1)
                    break
        else:
            print(-1)

# Call the function to process the input
func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Version:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the number of piranhas `n` and the list of sizes `a`.

2. **Finding the Dominant Piranha**:
   - Find the maximum size `m` in the list `a`.
   - Iterate through the list to find a piranha whose size is equal to `m`.
   - Check if this piranha can eat its neighbors. If it can, print its index (1-based) and break the loop.
   - If no such piranha is found, print `-1`.

This corrected version ensures that the program meets the problem description by correctly identifying and printing the index of any dominant piranha or `-1` if no such piranha exists.
