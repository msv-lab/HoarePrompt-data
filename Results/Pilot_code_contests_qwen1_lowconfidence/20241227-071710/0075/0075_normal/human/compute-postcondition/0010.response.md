`res` is assigned the value of `b[a % 16]` and added to `res`. The value of `a % 16` depends on the value of `a`, which must be greater than or equal to 16. However, since the exact value of `a` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `a % 16`. Therefore, the output state is: `a` must be greater than or equal to 16; `res` is updated by adding `b[a % 16]` to its current value.

Output State: **`a` must be greater than or equal to 16; `res` is updated by adding `b[a % 16]` to its current value**
