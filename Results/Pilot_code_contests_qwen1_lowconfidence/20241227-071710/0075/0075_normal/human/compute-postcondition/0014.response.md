The code `a /= 16` divides the value of `a` by 16. Since the initial state only mentions that `a` must be greater than 0 and does not specify its exact value, the exact value of `a` after division cannot be determined without additional information. However, the operation modifies `a` to be `a / 16`. The other variables (`res` and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`a` is `a / 16` (where `a` was initially greater than 0), `res` is updated to `res + b[a % 16]`, `b` remains unchanged**
