The code `res += b[0]` updates the value of `res` by adding the value of `b[0]` to it. In the initial state, `b[0]` is 1. Therefore, `res` will be updated to `res + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is 0
- `b` is `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0]`
- `res` is 0

After executing the code:
- `res` is updated to `0 + 1`, which is `1`

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is 0, `b` is [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0], `res` is 1**
