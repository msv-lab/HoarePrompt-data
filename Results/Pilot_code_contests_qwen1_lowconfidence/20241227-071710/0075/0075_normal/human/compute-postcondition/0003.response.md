Postcondition: ***`a` is 0, `b` is [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0], `res` is 0***

Explanation: The if condition checks whether `a` is equal to 0. Given the precondition, `a` is within the range of 0 to 2000000000, and the if condition is met when `a` is 0. Therefore, the postcondition retains the values of `a`, `b`, and `res` as specified in the precondition, with the additional information that the if condition has been satisfied by setting `a` to 0.
