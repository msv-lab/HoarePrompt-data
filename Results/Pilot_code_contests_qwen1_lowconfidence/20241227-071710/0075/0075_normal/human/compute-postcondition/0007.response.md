The code snippet `res += b[a % 16]` updates the value of `res` by adding the value of `b[a % 16]` to the current value of `res`. However, since the initial values of `a` and `b` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact updated value of `res`. We only know that `a` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the output state is: `a` must be greater than 0; `res` is updated by adding `b[a % 16]` to its current value.

Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0; `res` is updated by adding `b[a % 16]` to its current value**
