To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `a > 0`.
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `a` is updated to `a / 16`.
  - `res` is updated by adding `b[a % 16]` to its current value.
  - `res` must be a number.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `a > 0`.
2. **Update of `a`**: In each iteration, `a` is updated to `a / 16`. This means `a` is divided by 16 in every iteration.
3. **Update of `res`**: In each iteration, `res` is updated by adding `b[a % 16]` to its current value.

For the loop to continue executing one more time:
- The condition `a > 0` must be true.
- Since `a` is divided by 16 in each iteration, for `a > 0` to hold, `a` must still be a positive number after the update.

Given that `a` is updated to `a / 16` and must remain greater than 0, we need to ensure that `a` after the division is still positive.

### Conclusion:
- `a` must be greater than 0 after the update `a = a / 16`.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is `a` must be greater than 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` must be greater than 0**
