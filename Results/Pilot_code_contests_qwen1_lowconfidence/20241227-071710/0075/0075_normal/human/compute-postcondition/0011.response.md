The code `a /= 16` divides the value of `a` by 16 and updates `a` with the result. Since the initial state is that `a` must be greater than or equal to 16, after executing this line of code, `a` will be updated to `a / 16`. The other variables (`res` and `b`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is updated to `a / 16`, `res` is updated by adding `b[a % 16]` to its current value, `res` must be a number**
