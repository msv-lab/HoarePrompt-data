The code `print(res)` simply prints the value of `res`. Since the value of `res` is already determined by the way it was calculated before this line of code, printing it does not change its value. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is 0, `res` is the sum of `b[i]` where `i` is the remainder of `a` when divided by 16 for each iteration, `b` remains unchanged**
