Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the input values as described. Specifically, the code uses a fixed lookup table `b` which only contains values for hexadecimal digits from 0 to F (0 to 15 in decimal). However, the problem description does not specify that the input `n` should be within the range of a single hexadecimal digit. The code attempts to convert the entire number into its hexadecimal representation and sum the corresponding values from the lookup table, which is incorrect because it should only consider the last digit (least significant digit) of the number in each iteration of the loop.

For example, for the input `571576`, the correct output should be `10` because the least significant hexadecimal digit is `0x6` (which corresponds to `6` in decimal), and the second least significant digit is `0x7` (which corresponds to `7` in decimal), and so on. However, the code incorrectly processes the entire number, leading to an incorrect result. The code should only process the last digit of `n` in each iteration and then reduce `n` by integer division by 16.

To fix this, the code should be modified to only process the last digit of `n` in each iteration and then reduce `n` by integer division by 16, like so:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0]
    res = 0
    while a > 0:
        res += b[a % 16]
        a //= 16
    print(res)
```

This corrected version will correctly process the input and produce the expected output for all valid inputs within the specified range.
