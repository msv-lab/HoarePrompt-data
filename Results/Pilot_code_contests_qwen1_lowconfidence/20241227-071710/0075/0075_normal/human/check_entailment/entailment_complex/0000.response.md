Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program accepts a single integer `n` as input, which is within the specified range \(0 \leq n \leq 2000000000\).
2. **Base-16 Conversion and Lookup Table**: The program uses a lookup table `b` which contains values corresponding to hexadecimal digits (0-15). It iterates through the integer `a` by repeatedly taking the remainder of `a` when divided by 16 and adding the corresponding value from the lookup table to `res`.
3. **Sum Calculation**: The variable `res` accumulates the sum of these values until `a` becomes 0.
4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the value of `res`.

The program correctly handles all cases within the specified range and performs the necessary operations to convert the input number to its base-16 representation and sum the corresponding values from the lookup table. There are no cases where the program deviates from the problem description, and it correctly processes all valid inputs according to the given specifications.
