Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case when `n` is even, as specified in the problem description. The formula used in the program is designed to calculate the minimum side length of a square that can contain a regular polygon with `2n` vertices, but it does not account for the fact that `n` itself is always even. This means the program will produce incorrect results for odd values of `n`, which are valid inputs according to the problem statement.

For example, consider the case when `n = 3` (which is odd):
- The correct minimum side length for a 6-gon (2n-gon) can be derived from geometric properties, but the program will not handle this case because `n` is not even.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
