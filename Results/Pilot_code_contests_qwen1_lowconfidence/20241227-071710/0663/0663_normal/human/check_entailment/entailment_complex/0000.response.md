Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the solution described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: 
   - We are given a regular polygon with \(2 \cdot n\) vertices (2n-gon) and need to find the smallest square that can contain it.
   - The side length of the square is required to be printed for multiple test cases.

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function iterates over \(T\) test cases, where \(T\) is an integer between 1 and 200.
   - For each test case, it reads an even integer \(n\) such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200\).
   - It calculates the side length of the smallest square that can contain the 2n-gon using the formula: \(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \times \sqrt{2}\).

3. **Formula Derivation**:
   - The formula used in the program is derived from geometric properties of regular polygons and their inscribed squares.
   - Specifically, the height of the 2n-gon when inscribed in a circle of radius 1 is given by \(2 \cdot \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)\).
   - The diagonal of the smallest square that can contain the 2n-gon is equal to the diameter of the circumcircle of the 2n-gon, which is \(2\).
   - The side length \(s\) of the square can be found using trigonometric relationships involving the angles and the geometry of the 2n-gon.

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - The program uses the `math` module to access `sin`, `pi`, and `sqrt` functions.
   - The formula \(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \times \sqrt{2}\) is correctly applied in the loop for each test case.

Since the program correctly implements the formula and logic described in the problem statement for every valid input, the program is correct according to the problem description.
