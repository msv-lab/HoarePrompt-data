Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. Although the annotated version clarifies that the program assumes `n` is an even integer, the problem description explicitly states that `n` is always odd. The provided solution uses a formula that is specifically derived for even values of `n`, making it invalid for odd values of `n`. Therefore, the program will produce incorrect results for the test cases where `n` is odd, which is a requirement according to the problem statement. Thus, the program does not meet the problem description, and the original assessment remains correct.
