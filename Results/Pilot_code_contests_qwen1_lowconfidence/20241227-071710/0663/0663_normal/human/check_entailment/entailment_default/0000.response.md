Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum side length of a square that can embed a 2n-gon for every potential case. Specifically, the formula used in the program is incorrect for calculating the minimum side length of the square. The formula \(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \times \sqrt{2}\) is not the correct one for finding the side length of the square that can contain a 2n-gon.

To find the correct minimum side length of the square, we need to consider the geometry of the 2n-gon. The minimum side length of the square that can contain a 2n-gon is actually the distance between two opposite vertices of the 2n-gon. This distance can be calculated using trigonometric relationships, but the provided formula does not accurately represent this distance.

For example, for \(n = 2\) (a square), the correct side length of the square that can contain the 4-gon (square) is 1. However, the provided formula would yield an incorrect result.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
