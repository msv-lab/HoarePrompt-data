Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to calculate the minimum side length of a square that can embed a 2n-gon using the formula \(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \times \sqrt{2}\). However, this formula is incorrect for the given problem description. The problem requires finding the square of the minimum size, not the side length.

To be more precise, the correct approach would involve calculating the diagonal of the inscribed circle of the 2n-gon, which would give the minimum side length of the square. The correct formula should be related to the circumradius of the 2n-gon, not the sine values used in the current implementation.

For example, for \(n=2\), the 2n-gon is a rectangle (specifically, a square), and the minimum side length of the square is 1, which matches the output hint. However, for other values of \(n\), the current implementation does not produce the correct results. For instance, for \(n=4\) (an octagon), the correct minimum side length of the square should be approximately 2.414213562, but the provided program calculates a different value due to the incorrect formula.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
