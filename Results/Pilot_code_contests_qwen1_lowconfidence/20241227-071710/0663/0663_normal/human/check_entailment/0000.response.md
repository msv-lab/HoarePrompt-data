Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to calculate the minimum side length of a square that can embed a 2n-gon. However, the formula used in the program is incorrect. The formula `sin(pi / 4 + pi / (2 * n)) / sin(pi / (2 * n)) * sqrt(2)` does not accurately compute the required minimum side length of the square for embedding the 2n-gon.

To verify this, consider the case when \( n = 2 \):
- A 4-gon (or square) has a side length of 1.
- The correct minimum side length of the square that can embed this 4-gon should be 1.000000000.

However, using the provided formula:
\[
\text{side\_length} = \frac{\sin(\pi / 4 + \pi / 4)}{\sin(\pi / 4)} \cdot \sqrt{2} = \frac{\sin(\pi / 2)}{\sin(\pi / 4)} \cdot \sqrt{2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 1
\]
This seems correct for \( n = 2 \), but let's check another case, say \( n = 4 \):
- A 8-gon can be inscribed in a square with side length approximately \( 2.414213562 \).

Using the provided formula:
\[
\text{side\_length} = \frac{\sin(\pi / 4 + \pi / 8)}{\sin(\pi / 8)} \cdot \sqrt{2}
\]
Calculating the values:
\[
\sin(\pi / 4 + \pi / 8) = \sin(3\pi / 8) \approx 0.92388
\]
\[
\sin(\pi / 8) \approx 0.38268
\]
\[
\text{side\_length} = \frac{0.92388}{0.38268} \cdot \sqrt{2} \approx 2.414213562
\]
This seems correct for \( n = 4 \) as well. However, let's consider \( n = 3 \):
- A 6-gon (hexagon) can be inscribed in a square with side length approximately \( 1.732050808 \).

Using the provided formula:
\[
\text{side\_length} = \frac{\sin(\pi / 4 + \pi / 6)}{\sin(\pi / 6)} \cdot \sqrt{2}
\]
Calculating the values:
\[
\sin(\pi / 4 + \pi / 6) = \sin(5\pi / 12) \approx 0.96593
\]
\[
\sin(\pi / 6) = 0.5
\]
\[
\text{side\_length} = \frac{0.96593}{0.5} \cdot \sqrt{2} \approx 1.366025404 \cdot \sqrt{2} \approx 1.931851653
\]
This value does not match the expected side length of approximately 1.732050808 for a hexagon.

Therefore, the provided program does not correctly compute the minimum side length of the square for all cases, making it incorrect.
