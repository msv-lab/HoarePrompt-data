Let's analyze the given loop step by step:

### Initial State
- `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 200\).
- For each test case, `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200\).

### Loop Code
```python
for _ in range(input()):
    n = input()
    print(sin(pi / 4 + pi / (2 * n)) / sin(pi / (2 * n))) * sqrt(2)
```

### Analysis of the Loop
1. **First Iteration**:
   - `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 200\).
   - `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200\).
   - The print statement outputs a specific value based on the formula provided.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - The loop runs again, and `n` is another even integer within the specified range.
   - The print statement outputs another specific value based on the new `n`.

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - The loop runs again, and `n` is yet another even integer within the specified range.
   - The print statement outputs another specific value based on the new `n`.

### Observations
- The loop will execute `T` times.
- Each iteration, `n` is an even integer within the specified range.
- The print statement outputs a value based on the formula: \(\frac{\sin(\pi/4 + \pi/(2n))}{\sin(\pi/(2n))} \cdot \sqrt{2}\).

### Mathematical Simplification
Let's simplify the expression inside the print statement:
\[ \frac{\sin(\pi/4 + \pi/(2n))}{\sin(\pi/(2n))} \cdot \sqrt{2} \]

Using trigonometric identities, we can simplify this expression. However, the exact simplification is not necessary for determining the final state of the variables.

### Final Output State
- After `T` iterations, the loop will have executed `T` times.
- Each time the loop runs, `n` is an even integer within the specified range.
- The print statement will output a value for each `n`, but the specific value depends on the current `n`.
- Since the loop runs `T` times, `T` is the final value of the loop counter.

### Conclusion
The final state of the loop after all iterations will be:
- `T` is the final value of the loop counter, indicating the number of times the loop executed.
- `n` is an even integer within the specified range for each iteration, but the exact value of `n` in the last iteration is the final value of `n`.

### Output State
Output State: **`T` is the final value of the loop counter, indicating the number of times the loop executed, and `n` is an even integer within the specified range for each iteration, but the exact value of `n` in the last iteration is the final value of `n`.**
