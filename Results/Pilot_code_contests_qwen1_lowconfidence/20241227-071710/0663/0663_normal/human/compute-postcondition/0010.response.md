The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. The functionality of the function involves processing test cases where `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 200\), and for each test case, `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200\). Based on these constraints, the function returns different values depending on the conditions specified.

Functionality: **The function processes test cases with an integer `T` where \(1 \leq T \leq 200\) and an even integer `n` where \(2 \leq n \leq 200\), and returns values based on specific conditions.**
