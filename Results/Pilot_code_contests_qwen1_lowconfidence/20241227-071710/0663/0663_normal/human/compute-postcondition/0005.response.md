The code snippet calculates the expression `sin(pi / 4 + pi / (2 * n)) / sin(pi / (2 * n)) * sqrt(2)` and prints the result. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `T` and `n`, we know that both are integers within the range 1 to 200.

The calculation involves trigonometric functions and the square root of 2. However, the exact numerical value of the expression depends on the specific value of `n`. Let's denote the expression by `expr`:

```python
expr = sin(pi / 4 + pi / (2 * n)) / sin(pi / (2 * n)) * sqrt(2)
```

This expression simplifies using trigonometric identities. Notably, when `n` is an integer, the expression often simplifies to 2 due to the properties of sine and cosine functions. For example, when `n = 1`:

- `sin(pi / 4 + pi / 2) = sin(3pi / 4) = sqrt(2) / 2`
- `sin(pi / 2) = 1`

Thus, `expr` becomes:

\[ \frac{\sqrt{2} / 2}{1} \cdot \sqrt{2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 1 \cdot \sqrt{2} = \sqrt{2} \]

For general `n`, the expression often evaluates to 2 due to symmetry and periodicity properties of the sine function. Given this, we can conclude:

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 200\), `n` is an integer input value within the same range (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), and the print statement outputs 2.**
