Functionality: **The function processes `T` test cases, where `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 200\). For each test case, it reads an even integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200\). The function then computes and prints the value of \(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \times \sqrt{2}\) for each `n`. After executing the loop `T` times, the function does not return any value; instead, it prints the computed values for each test case.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The code assumes that the input is always valid (i.e., `T` is within the range \([1, 200]\) and `n` is an even integer within the range \([2, 200]\)). If the input does not meet these conditions, the program will fail without any error handling.
- There is no explicit handling for the case where `n` might be 2, which is the minimum allowed value. Although the code works for `n = 2`, it might be useful to add a special check or note that the behavior for `n = 2` is well-defined.
- The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. If the function were to return the list of computed values, it would need to store them in a list and return that list at the end of the function.
