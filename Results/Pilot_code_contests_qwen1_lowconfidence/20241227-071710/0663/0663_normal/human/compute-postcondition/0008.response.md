The code calculates the value of `sin(pi / 4 + pi / (2 * n)) / sin(pi / (2 * n)) * sqrt(2)`. Since `n` is initially 2, let's substitute `n` with 2 in the expression:

- First, evaluate `pi / (2 * n)`, which is `pi / 4`.
- Then, evaluate `sin(pi / 4 + pi / 4) / sin(pi / 4) * sqrt(2)`, which simplifies to `sin(pi / 2) / sin(pi / 4) * sqrt(2)`.

Since `sin(pi / 2) = 1` and `sin(pi / 4) = sqrt(2) / 2`, the expression becomes:

\[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}/2} * \sqrt{2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}/2} * \sqrt{2} = 2 * \sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2} \]

Therefore, the output of the print statement is `2 * sqrt(2)`.

The value of `T` remains unchanged, and `n` remains 2. Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 200\), `n` is 2, and the output of the print statement is `2 * sqrt(2)`**.
