The code calculates the expression `print(sin(pi / 4 + pi / (2 * n)) / sin(pi / (2 * n))) * sqrt(2)`. This expression does not assign a value to any variable, but rather prints the result of the expression. The values of `T` and `n` remain unchanged.

The expression simplifies to `sqrt(2)` because `sin(pi / 4 + pi / (2 * n)) / sin(pi / (2 * n))` equals 1 for any valid `n` (since `sin(pi / 4 + pi / (2 * n))` and `sin(pi / (2 * n))` are equal in this context).

Therefore, the printed result is `sqrt(2)`. The values of `T` and `n` remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 200, `n` is an input value within the same range (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), and the printed result is `sqrt(2)`**.
