`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means `n` takes the value entered by the user, and `T` is still an integer within the range of 1 to 200. The exact value of `n` depends on user input, but it is constrained by the initial state.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 200, `n` is an input value within the same range (1 ≤ n ≤ 200)**
