The function processes `T` test cases, where `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 200\). For each test case, it reads an even integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200\). The function then computes and prints the value of \(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \times \sqrt{2}\) for each `n`. After executing the loop `T` times, the function does not return any value; instead, it prints the computed values for each test case.
