Postcondition: **`i` is the index where `el` would be inserted in `b` to keep it sorted, or the index of the first occurrence of `el` in `b`; `b` and `el` remain as they were initially; `min_r` is updated to the maximum value between its initial value and the minimum of `abs(next_el - b[0])` when `i == 0`, and the maximum of its current value and the minimum of `abs(next_el - b[-1])` when `i == len(b)`, and the maximum of its current value and the minimum of `abs(next_el - b[i - 1])`, `abs(next_el - b[i])`, and `abs(next_el - b[i + 1])` otherwise; `min_r` is also updated to include the maximum value between its initial value and the absolute difference between `el` and the last element in `b` if `i == m`, and the maximum value between its current value and the minimum of `abs(el - b[m - 1])`, `abs(el - b[m - 2])`, and `abs(el - b[m])` if `i == m - 1`.**
