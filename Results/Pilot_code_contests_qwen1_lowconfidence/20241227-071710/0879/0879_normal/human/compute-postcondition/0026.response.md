Postcondition: ***`i` is the index where `el` would be inserted in `b` to keep it sorted, or the index of the first occurrence of `el` in `b`; `b` and `el` are as they were initially; `min_r` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and the minimum of `abs(el - b[m - 1])` when `i == m`, and the maximum of its current value and the minimum of `abs(el - b[i + 1])`, `abs(el - b[i - 1])`, and `abs(el - b[i])` otherwise.***
