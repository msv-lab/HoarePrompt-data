The code `a = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to an integer type, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The values of `n`, `m`, `b`, and the original lists `a` and `b` are not affected.

Let's denote the input line as `input_str`. After executing the code, `a` will be a list of integers converted from `input_str`. The length of `a` will be `n`.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of the first integer input, `m` is assigned the value of the second integer input, `a` is a list of integers converted from the space-separated integers in the third input line, and `b` remains as a non-decreasing list of integers with length `m`.**
