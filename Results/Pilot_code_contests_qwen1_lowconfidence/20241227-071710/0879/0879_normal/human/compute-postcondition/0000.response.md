The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. These integers represent the number of cities and cellular towers, respectively. Since the initial values of `n` and `m` are non-decreasing lists of integers, and these lists are not modified by the given code, the only variables that are affected are `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of the first integer input, `m` is assigned the value of the second integer input, and the lists `a` and `b` remain as non-decreasing lists of integers with lengths `n` and `m` respectively.**
