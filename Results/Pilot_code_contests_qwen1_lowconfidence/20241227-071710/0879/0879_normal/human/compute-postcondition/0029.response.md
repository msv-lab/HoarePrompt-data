The code `i = bisect_left(b, el)` assigns the value of `i` to be the index where `el` would be inserted in the list `b` to keep it sorted, or the index of the first occurrence of `el` in `b`. This operation does not affect the values of `b` or `el`, and it updates `i` accordingly. Additionally, this operation also impacts `min_r` according to the rules specified.

Given the rules for updating `min_r`:
- If `i == 0`, `min_r` is updated to the maximum value between its initial value and the minimum of `abs(next_el - b[0])`.
- If `i == len(b)`, `min_r` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the minimum of `abs(next_el - b[-1])`.
- Otherwise, `min_r` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the minimum of `abs(next_el - b[i - 1])`, `abs(next_el - b[i])`, and `abs(next_el - b[i + 1])`.

Since `i` is now set to the result of `bisect_left(b, el)`, we need to consider the three cases for updating `min_r`:

1. If `i == 0`, `min_r` is updated to the maximum of its initial value and `abs(next_el - b[0])`.
2. If `i == len(b)`, `min_r` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `abs(next_el - b[-1])`.
3. Otherwise, `min_r` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the minimum of `abs(next_el - b[i - 1])`, `abs(next_el - b[i])`, and `abs(next_el - b[i + 1])`.

The output state includes the updated value of `i` and the updated value of `min_r` according to these rules.

Output State: **`i` is the index where `el` would be inserted in `b` to keep it sorted, or the index of the first occurrence of `el` in `b`; `b` and `el` are as they were initially; `min_r` is updated to the maximum value between its initial value and the minimum of `abs(next_el - b[0])` when `i == 0`, and the maximum of its current value and the minimum of `abs(next_el - b[-1])` when `i == len(b)`, and the maximum of its current value and the minimum of `abs(next_el - b[i - 1])`, `abs(next_el - b[i])`, and `abs(next_el - b[i + 1])` otherwise.**
