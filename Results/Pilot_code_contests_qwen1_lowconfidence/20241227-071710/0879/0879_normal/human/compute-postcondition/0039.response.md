The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5\). Additionally, the function accepts two lists: `a` and `b`. List `a` contains `n` non-decreasing integers representing the x-coordinates of cities, and list `b` contains `m` non-decreasing integers representing the x-coordinates of cellular towers.

The function does not return any value directly based on the given output cases, but rather processes the input lists `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `m` (both positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5\)), and two lists `a` and `b` (where `a` contains `n` non-decreasing integers and `b` contains `m` non-decreasing integers).**
