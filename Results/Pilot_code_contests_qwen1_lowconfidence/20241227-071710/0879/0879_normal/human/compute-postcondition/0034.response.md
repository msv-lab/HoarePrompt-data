Postcondition: ***`i` is the index where `el` would be inserted in `b` to keep it sorted, or the index of the first occurrence of `el` in `b`; `b` and `el` are as they were initially; `min_r` is updated to the maximum value between its initial value and the minimum of `d_{left}`, `d_{current}`, and `d_{right}`, where `d_{left}` is `abs(el - b[m - 1])` and `d_{current}` is `abs(el - b[m - 2])` when `i == m - 1`, and otherwise includes `d_{left}`, `d_{current}`, and `d_{right}` which are `abs(next_el - b[i - 1])`, `abs(next_el - b[i])`, and `abs(next_el - b[i + 1])`.***
