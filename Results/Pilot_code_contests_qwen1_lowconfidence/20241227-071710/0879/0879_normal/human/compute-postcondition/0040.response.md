Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (both such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5\)), and two lists `a` and `b` (where `a` contains `n` non-decreasing integers and `b` contains `m` non-decreasing integers). It calculates the minimum radius `r` such that every city represented by an element in `a` can be covered by a cellular tower represented by an element in `b`. Specifically, for each city `el` in `a`, it finds the nearest cellular tower in `b` and determines the maximum distance `r` among these nearest distances. If a city has no suitable tower (i.e., it is beyond the first or last tower), it considers the nearest available tower. The function then prints this minimum radius `r`.**

This summary covers the following aspects:
- The function inputs and their constraints.
- The process of finding the nearest tower for each city.
- Handling edge cases where cities are at the boundaries of the tower coverage range.
- Determining the maximum distance among all nearest distances, which represents the minimum radius required to cover all cities.
