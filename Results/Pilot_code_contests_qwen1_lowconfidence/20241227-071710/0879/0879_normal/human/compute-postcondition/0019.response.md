Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `m` is the second integer input.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `b` is a list of integers.
   - `min_r` is updated based on the conditions mentioned.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for el in a:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   The loop will execute as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `el` was the last element processed from the list `a`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next element from `a` must be considered.

Given these points, we need to update the state to reflect the next iteration of the loop:

- `n` and `m` remain the same since they are not affected by the loop.
- `a` will now be the list `a` without the first element that was processed in the previous iteration.
- `b` remains unchanged.
- `min_r` will be updated based on the new value of `el` (the next element from `a`).

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `min_r` are not provided, we will keep them in their general form but note the changes required for the next iteration.

**State:**
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `m` is the second integer input.
- `a` is a list of integers, excluding the first element that was processed in the previous iteration.
- `b` is a list of integers.
- `min_r` is updated based on the new value of `el` (the next element from `a`).

**State:**
**`n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of integers excluding the first element, `b` is a list of integers, and `min_r` is updated based on the new value of `el` (the next element from `a`).**
