The code `i = bisect_left(b, el)` assigns the value of `bisect_left(b, el)` to `i`. However, without knowing the actual values of `b` and `el`, we cannot determine the exact value of `i`. But we know that `i` is the index in the list `b` where the element `el` would be inserted to keep the list sorted, or the index of the first occurrence of `el` in the list `b`.

Output State: **`i` is the index where `el` would be inserted in `b` to keep it sorted, or the index of the first occurrence of `el` in `b`; `b` and `el` are as they were initially.**
