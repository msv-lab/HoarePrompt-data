Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `min_r` is the maximum of 0 and the minimum of the absolute differences between `el` and the elements at indices `m-1`, `m-2`, and `i` (the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `b` minus 1) in `b`, and `i` equals `m` - 1 if the condition `i == m - 1` is true. Otherwise, `min_r` is updated to the maximum of 0 and the minimum of the absolute differences between `el` and the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` in `b`.***
