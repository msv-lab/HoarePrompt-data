Postcondition: ***`i` is the index where `el` would be inserted in `b` to keep it sorted, or the index of the first occurrence of `el` in `b`; `b` and `el` remain as they were initially; `min_r` is updated to the maximum value between its initial value and the absolute difference between `el` and the first element of `b` (`b[0]`) when `i == 0`, the absolute difference between `el` and the last element of `b` (`b[-1]`) when `i == len(b)`, and the minimum of `abs(next_el - b[i - 1])`, `abs(next_el - b[i])`, and `abs(next_el - b[i + 1])` when `i` is neither 0 nor the length of `b`. Additionally, `min_r` is updated to include the maximum value between its initial value and the absolute difference between `el` and the last element in `b` if `i == m`, and the maximum value between its current value and the minimum of `abs(el - b[m - 1])`, `abs(el - b[m - 2])`, and `abs(el - b[m])` if `i == m - 1`.***
