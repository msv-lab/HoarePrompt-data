Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, and `min_r` is updated as follows: 
- If `i == m`, then `min_r` is updated to the maximum of 0 and the minimum of the absolute differences between `el` and the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` in `b`.
- Otherwise, `min_r` is set to `max(min_r, abs(el - b[m - 1]))`, where `el` is the element at index `i` in `b` and `i` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `b`.***
