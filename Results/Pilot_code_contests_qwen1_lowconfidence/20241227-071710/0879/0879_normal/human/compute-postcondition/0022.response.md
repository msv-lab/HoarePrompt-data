`min_r` is assigned the value of `max(min_r, abs(el - b[m - 1]))`. This means `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the absolute difference between `el` and `b[m - 1]`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `b`, and `el`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is the index where `el` would be inserted in `b` to keep it sorted, or the index of the first occurrence of `el` in `b`; `b` and `el` are as they were initially; `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `abs(el - b[m - 1])`**
