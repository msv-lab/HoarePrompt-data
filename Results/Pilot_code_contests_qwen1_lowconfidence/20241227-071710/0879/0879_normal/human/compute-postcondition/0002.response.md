The code `b = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings using whitespace as the delimiter, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `b`. The previous value of `b` was a non-decreasing list of integers with length `m`, but now it is updated to the new list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of the first integer input, `m` is assigned the value of the second integer input, `a` is a list of integers converted from the space-separated integers in the third input line, and `b` is a list of integers read from the input, which may not be a non-decreasing list and may have a different length than `m`.**
