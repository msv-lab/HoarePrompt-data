You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given n points on the straight line — the positions (x-coordinates) of the cities and m points on the same line — the positions (x-coordinates) of the cellular towers. All towers work in the same way — they provide cellular network for all cities, which are located at the distance which is no more than r from this tower.

Your task is to find minimal r that each city has been provided by cellular network, i.e. for each city there is at least one cellular tower at the distance which is no more than r.

If r = 0 then a tower provides cellular network only for the point where it is located. One tower can provide cellular network for any number of cities, but all these cities must be at the distance which is no more than r from this tower.

Input

The first line contains two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105) — the number of cities and the number of cellular towers.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an ( - 109 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — the coordinates of cities. It is allowed that there are any number of cities in the same point. All coordinates ai are given in non-decreasing order.

The third line contains a sequence of m integers b1, b2, ..., bm ( - 109 ≤ bj ≤ 109) — the coordinates of cellular towers. It is allowed that there are any number of towers in the same point. All coordinates bj are given in non-decreasing order.

Output

Print minimal r so that each city will be covered by cellular network.

Program:

from bisect import bisect_left

def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    b = map(int, raw_input().split())
    min_r = 0
    for el in a:
        i = bisect_left(b, el)
        if i == 0:
            min_r = max(min_r, abs(el - b[0]))
        elif i == m:
            min_r = max(min_r, abs(el - b[m - 1]))
        elif i == m - 1:
            min_r = max(min_r, min(abs(el - b[m - 1]), abs(el - b[m - 2])))
        else:
            min_r = max(min_r, min(abs(el - b[i + 1]), abs(el - b[i - 1]), abs(el - b[i])))
    print(min_r)


```
Output hints: The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (both such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5\)), and two lists `a` and `b` (where `a` contains `n` non-decreasing integers and `b` contains `m` non-decreasing integers). It calculates the minimum radius `r` such that every city represented by an element in `a` can be covered by a cellular tower represented by an element in `b`. Specifically, for each city `el` in `a`, it finds the nearest cellular tower in `b` and determines the maximum distance `r` among these nearest distances. If a city has no suitable tower (i.e., it is beyond the first or last tower), it considers the nearest available tower. The function then prints this minimum radius `r`.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
