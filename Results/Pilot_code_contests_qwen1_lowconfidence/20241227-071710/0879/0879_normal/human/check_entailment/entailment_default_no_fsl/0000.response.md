Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the code fails to consider the scenario where a city is equidistant between two towers. In such cases, the current implementation may not select the correct tower, leading to an incorrect minimal radius `r`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 3
-2 2 4
-3 0 5
```
The correct minimal radius `r` should be 3, as the city at position 2 can be covered by either the tower at 0 or the tower at 5. However, the current implementation might not correctly determine this, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the code should explicitly handle the case where a city is equidistant between two towers and choose the minimum distance to ensure coverage.
