Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum radius \( r \) such that each city is covered by at least one cellular tower. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the closest tower to a city is not immediately adjacent to it. 

Consider the following input:
```
3 2
-2 2 4
-3 0
```
The output of the program is `4`, but the correct output should be `3`. This is because the city at position `2` needs to be within a distance of `3` from the tower at position `0` to be covered. The current implementation does not account for the minimum distance accurately in all scenarios.
