You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given n points on the straight line — the positions (x-coordinates) of the cities and m points on the same line — the positions (x-coordinates) of the cellular towers. All towers work in the same way — they provide cellular network for all cities, which are located at the distance which is no more than r from this tower.

Your task is to find minimal r that each city has been provided by cellular network, i.e. for each city there is at least one cellular tower at the distance which is no more than r.

If r = 0 then a tower provides cellular network only for the point where it is located. One tower can provide cellular network for any number of cities, but all these cities must be at the distance which is no more than r from this tower.

Input

The first line contains two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105) — the number of cities and the number of cellular towers.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an ( - 109 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — the coordinates of cities. It is allowed that there are any number of cities in the same point. All coordinates ai are given in non-decreasing order.

The third line contains a sequence of m integers b1, b2, ..., bm ( - 109 ≤ bj ≤ 109) — the coordinates of cellular towers. It is allowed that there are any number of towers in the same point. All coordinates bj are given in non-decreasing order.

Output

Print minimal r so that each city will be covered by cellular network.

from bisect import bisect_left

def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    b = map(int, raw_input().split())
    min_r = 0
    for el in a:
        i = bisect_left(b, el)
        if i == 0:
            min_r = max(min_r, abs(el - b[0]))
        elif i == m:
            min_r = max(min_r, abs(el - b[m - 1]))
        elif i == m - 1:
            min_r = max(min_r, min(abs(el - b[m - 1]), abs(el - b[m - 2])))
        else:
            min_r = max(min_r, min(abs(el - b[i + 1]), abs(el - b[i - 1]), abs(el - b[i])))
    print(min_r)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum radius \( r \) such that each city is covered by at least one cellular tower. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the closest tower to a city is not immediately adjacent to it. 

Consider the following input:
```
3 2
-2 2 4
-3 0
```
The output of the program is `4`, but the correct output should be `3`. This is because the city at position `2` needs to be within a distance of `3` from the tower at position `0` to be covered. The current implementation does not account for the minimum distance accurately in all scenarios.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from bisect import bisect_left

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5. The list a contains n non-decreasing integers representing the x-coordinates of cities, and the list b contains m non-decreasing integers representing the x-coordinates of cellular towers.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    b = map(int, raw_input().split())
    min_r = 0
    for el in a:
        i = bisect_left(b, el)
        
        if i == 0:
            min_r = max(min_r, abs(el - b[0]))
        elif i == m:
            min_r = max(min_r, abs(el - b[m - 1]))
        elif i == m - 1:
            min_r = max(min_r, min(abs(el - b[m - 1]), abs(el - b[m - 2])))
        else:
            min_r = max(min_r, min(abs(el - b[i + 1]), abs(el - b[i - 1]), abs(el -
                b[i])))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, and `min_r` is the maximum of the absolute differences between elements in `a` and their nearest neighbors in `b` under the specified conditions.
    print(min_r)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
