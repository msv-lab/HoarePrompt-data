Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where all digits are of the same parity correctly. Let's consider the input `1111`. In this case, all digits are odd, and no swaps can be made since adjacent digits always have the same parity. The program attempts to separate even and odd digits but fails to handle this scenario properly. As a result, it will output `1111` instead of the smallest possible integer `1111`, which is already the smallest it can be given the constraint.

To fix this, the program needs to handle cases where all digits are of the same parity by sorting the digits directly without attempting to separate them into even and odd deques.
