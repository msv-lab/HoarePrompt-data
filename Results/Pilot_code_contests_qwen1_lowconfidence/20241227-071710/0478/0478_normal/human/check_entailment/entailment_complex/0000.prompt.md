You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a huge integer a consisting of n digits (n is between 1 and 3 ⋅ 10^5, inclusive). It may contain leading zeros.

You can swap two digits on adjacent (neighboring) positions if the swapping digits are of different parity (that is, they have different remainders when divided by 2). 

For example, if a = 032867235 you can get the following integers in a single operation: 

  * 302867235 if you swap the first and the second digits; 
  * 023867235 if you swap the second and the third digits; 
  * 032876235 if you swap the fifth and the sixth digits; 
  * 032862735 if you swap the sixth and the seventh digits; 
  * 032867325 if you swap the seventh and the eighth digits. 



Note, that you can't swap digits on positions 2 and 4 because the positions are not adjacent. Also, you can't swap digits on positions 3 and 4 because the digits have the same parity.

You can perform any number (possibly, zero) of such operations.

Find the minimum integer you can obtain.

Note that the resulting integer also may contain leading zeros.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases in the input.

The only line of each test case contains the integer a, its length n is between 1 and 3 ⋅ 10^5, inclusive.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all values n does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case print line — the minimum integer you can obtain.

Example

Input


3
0709
1337
246432


Output


0079
1337
234642

Note

In the first test case, you can perform the following sequence of operations (the pair of swapped digits is highlighted): 0 \underline{70} 9 → 0079.

In the second test case, the initial integer is optimal. 

In the third test case you can perform the following sequence of operations: 246 \underline{43} 2 → 24 \underline{63}42 → 2 \underline{43} 642 → 234642.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a variable-length argument list containing integers and strings, and kwargs is a dictionary containing keyword arguments such as 'sep' for specifying the separator, 'file' for specifying the output stream (defaulting to sys.stdout), 'end' for specifying the ending character (defaulting to a newline), and 'flush' for controlling whether the stream should be flushed after writing.
def func_1():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a variable-length argument list containing integers and strings, `at_start` is False, and the file contains the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by the value of `sep`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a variable-length argument list containing integers and strings, `at_start` is False, and the file contains the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by the value of `sep`, followed by the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, the file has been flushed. Otherwise, the file remains unflushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function prints the values of a variable-length argument list `args` (containing integers and strings) to a specified output stream (`kwargs['file']`, defaulting to `sys.stdout`). It uses a specified separator (`kwargs['sep']`, defaulting to a space) between the values and adds an ending character (`kwargs['end']`, defaulting to a newline) at the end. Additionally, it allows for flushing the output stream (`kwargs['flush']`, defaulting to `False`) after writing. The function does not modify the `args` list or the `kwargs` dictionary. After the function executes, the output stream contains the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by the value of `sep`, followed by the value of `kwargs['end']`. If `kwargs['flush']` is `True`, the output stream is flushed. If `kwargs['flush']` is `False`, the output stream remains unflushed.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a string representing a huge integer consisting of n digits (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'. The integer may contain leading zeros.

    for digit in num:
        if digit & 1 == 0:
            even_digits.append(digit)
        else:
            odd_digits.append(digit)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `num` is a list of integers, `even_digits` is a deque containing all the even digits encountered during the iteration of `num`, and `odd_digits` is a deque containing all the odd digits encountered during the iteration of `num`.
    ret = []
    for _ in range(len(num)):
        if not odd_digits or even_digits and even_digits[0] < odd_digits[0]:
            ret.append(even_digits.popleft())
        else:
            ret.append(odd_digits.popleft())
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `num` is a list of integers, `even_digits` is a deque, and `odd_digits` is a deque. `ret` is a list that contains the smallest even digit encountered so far followed by the smallest odd digit encountered so far for each pair of consecutive iterations where the even digit is smaller. If there are no such pairs, `ret` contains the smallest even digit followed by the smallest odd digit from the entire list.
    return ''.join(map(str, ret))
    #The program returns a string that concatenates the smallest even digit encountered so far followed by the smallest odd digit encountered so far for each pair of consecutive iterations where the even digit is smaller. If there are no such pairs, it returns the smallest even digit followed by the smallest odd digit from the entire list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `num` representing a large integer. It processes this string to extract even and odd digits into separate deques, then constructs a new string by alternating between the smallest available even and odd digits, ensuring that an even digit is placed before an odd digit when both are available and the even digit is smaller. If no such pairs exist, it returns the smallest even digit followed by the smallest odd digit from the entire list. Potential edge cases include strings with only even or only odd digits, or empty input strings. The function handles these cases by appropriately populating and processing the deques.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
