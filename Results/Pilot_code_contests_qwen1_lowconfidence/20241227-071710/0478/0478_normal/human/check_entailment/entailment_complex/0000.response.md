Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code does not account for the scenario where there are no adjacent digits of different parity (i.e., no even-odd or odd-even pairs) to swap. This means that if all digits are either even or odd, the code will not produce the minimum possible integer as required by the problem description.

To illustrate, consider the input `111111`. According to the problem description, the minimum integer should be `111111` itself since there are no even and odd digits to swap. However, the current implementation will still attempt to swap the digits and will not produce the correct result.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

Input: `111111`
Expected Output: `111111`
Actual Output: The program will attempt to swap digits but will not produce the correct result.

Therefore, the code is not correct for every potential case, hence the output is **False**.
