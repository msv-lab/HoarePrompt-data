Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code in `func_2` does not handle the case where there are no even digits or no odd digits remaining in their respective deques. According to the problem description, we should be able to swap adjacent digits of different parity to form the smallest possible integer. However, the current implementation in `func_2` will fail to produce the correct output in scenarios where one of the deques becomes empty before the other. For example, consider the input "1111" or "2222". In these cases, the code will not be able to alternate between even and odd digits and will fail to produce the smallest possible integer.

To illustrate, let's take the input "1111":
- `func_2` will split the digits into `even_digits = []` and `odd_digits = [1, 1, 1, 1]`.
- The loop will attempt to append from `odd_digits` until it is empty, resulting in the output "1111" instead of the correct output "1111".

Similarly, for the input "2222":
- `func_2` will split the digits into `even_digits = [2, 2, 2, 2]` and `odd_digits = []`.
- The loop will attempt to append from `even_digits` until it is empty, resulting in the output "2222" instead of the correct output "2222".

To fix this, the code should ensure that it alternates between the smallest available even and odd digits until both deques are empty. If one deque runs out of digits, it should continue appending the remaining digits from the other deque.
