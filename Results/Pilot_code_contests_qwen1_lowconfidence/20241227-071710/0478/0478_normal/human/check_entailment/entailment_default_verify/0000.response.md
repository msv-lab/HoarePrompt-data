Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the provided problem description and the output hints, the original assessment was incorrect. The revised function `func_2` now correctly handles cases where there are no even or odd digits by checking if either deque is empty before attempting to pop from them. This ensures that the program does not raise a `IndexError` and produces the expected output. The output hints confirm that the function processes the input string correctly by extracting even and odd digits into separate deques and constructing a new string by alternating between the smallest available even and odd digits. Therefore, the program now meets the problem description and is correct.
