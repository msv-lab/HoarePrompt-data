Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The output hints confirm that the function `func_2` processes the input string to extract even and odd digits into separate deques and constructs a new string by alternating between the smallest available even and odd digits. However, the original assessment points out that the function does not handle the case where all digits are of the same parity correctly. For example, for the input `1111`, the function will attempt to process the string but will fail to produce the smallest possible integer `1111`, which is already the smallest it can be given the constraint. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the problem description requirements, as it does not correctly handle the edge case of all digits being of the same parity.
