Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_2` attempts to alternate between the smallest available even and odd digits, but it fails to handle cases where the string consists entirely of even or odd digits. In such cases, the function will not produce the correct minimum integer. For example, consider the input "22222":

- According to the problem description, the minimum integer that can be obtained by swapping adjacent digits of different parity should be "22222" itself, as no swaps are possible.
- However, the current implementation will attempt to alternate between even and odd digits, which does not apply here since all digits are even. As a result, it will produce an incorrect output.

To fix this, the function should directly return the input string if it consists entirely of even or odd digits.
