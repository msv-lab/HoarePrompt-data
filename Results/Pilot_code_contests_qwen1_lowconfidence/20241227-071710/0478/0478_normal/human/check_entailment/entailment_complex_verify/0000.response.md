Final: **False**

Reasoning:
Based on the provided annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. Although the revised `func_2` function now handles cases where there are no even or odd digits by ensuring that deques are not empty before popping from them, there are still issues with the logic and the overall approach of the function.

Here are the key points:
1. **Logic Flaws**: The function attempts to construct a string by alternating between the smallest available even and odd digits. However, the logic to determine the smallest even and odd digits in each step is flawed. Specifically, the current implementation does not correctly alternate between even and odd digits in the desired manner. For example, in the input "246432", the current implementation does not correctly produce the expected output "234642".

2. **Edge Cases**: While the revised function handles the case where one of the deques is empty, it does not address other edge cases properly. For instance, if the input is "1111" (all odd digits), the function will incorrectly handle it, as it assumes there must be at least one even digit to alternate with.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being incorrect is still valid.
