You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a huge integer a consisting of n digits (n is between 1 and 3 ⋅ 10^5, inclusive). It may contain leading zeros.

You can swap two digits on adjacent (neighboring) positions if the swapping digits are of different parity (that is, they have different remainders when divided by 2). 

For example, if a = 032867235 you can get the following integers in a single operation: 

  * 302867235 if you swap the first and the second digits; 
  * 023867235 if you swap the second and the third digits; 
  * 032876235 if you swap the fifth and the sixth digits; 
  * 032862735 if you swap the sixth and the seventh digits; 
  * 032867325 if you swap the seventh and the eighth digits. 



Note, that you can't swap digits on positions 2 and 4 because the positions are not adjacent. Also, you can't swap digits on positions 3 and 4 because the digits have the same parity.

You can perform any number (possibly, zero) of such operations.

Find the minimum integer you can obtain.

Note that the resulting integer also may contain leading zeros.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases in the input.

The only line of each test case contains the integer a, its length n is between 1 and 3 ⋅ 10^5, inclusive.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all values n does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case print line — the minimum integer you can obtain.

Example

Input


3
0709
1337
246432


Output


0079
1337
234642

Note

In the first test case, you can perform the following sequence of operations (the pair of swapped digits is highlighted): 0 \underline{70} 9 → 0079.

In the second test case, the initial integer is optimal. 

In the third test case you can perform the following sequence of operations: 246 \underline{43} 2 → 24 \underline{63}42 → 2 \underline{43} 642 → 234642.

```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where all digits are of the same parity correctly. Let's consider the input `1111`. In this case, all digits are odd, and no swaps can be made since adjacent digits always have the same parity. The program attempts to separate even and odd digits but fails to handle this scenario properly. As a result, it will output `1111` instead of the smallest possible integer `1111`, which is already the smallest it can be given the constraint.

To fix this, the program needs to handle cases where all digits are of the same parity by sorting the digits directly without attempting to separate them into even and odd deques.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Function 1:

If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, the file has been flushed. Otherwise, the file remains unflushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function prints the values of a variable-length argument list `args` (containing integers and strings) to a specified output stream (`kwargs['file']`, defaulting to `sys.stdout`). It uses a specified separator (`kwargs['sep']`, defaulting to a space) between the values and adds an ending character (`kwargs['end']`, defaulting to a newline) at the end. Additionally, it allows for flushing the output stream (`kwargs['flush']`, defaulting to `False`) after writing. The function does not modify the `args` list or the `kwargs` dictionary. After the function executes, the output stream contains the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by the value of `sep`, followed by the value of `kwargs['end']`. If `kwargs['flush']` is `True`, the output stream is flushed. If `kwargs['flush']` is `False`, the output stream remains unflushed.

If there are no such pairs, `ret` contains the smallest even digit followed by the smallest odd digit from the entire list.
    return ''.join(map(str, ret))
    #The program returns a string that concatenates the smallest even digit encountered so far followed by the smallest odd digit encountered so far for each pair of consecutive iterations where the even digit is smaller. If there are no such pairs, it returns the smallest even digit followed by the smallest odd digit from the entire list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `num` representing a large integer. It processes this string to extract even and odd digits into separate deques, then constructs a new string by alternating between the smallest available even and odd digits, ensuring that an even digit is placed before an odd digit when both are available and the even digit is smaller. If no such pairs exist, it returns the smallest even digit followed by the smallest odd digit from the entire list. Potential edge cases include strings with only even or only odd digits, or empty input strings. The function handles these cases by appropriately populating and processing the deques.
