Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the program does not handle cases where all digits are of the same parity correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` attempts to separate even and odd digits into deques but fails to produce the correct output when all digits are of the same parity. For example, the input `1111` should result in `1111` remaining unchanged, but the current implementation does not account for this scenario properly. Instead of sorting or handling these cases directly, the program tries to find the smallest even digit and the smallest odd digit for each pair of consecutive iterations, which leads to incorrect results in such cases. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
