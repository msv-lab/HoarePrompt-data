#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a variable-length argument list containing integers and strings, and kwargs is a dictionary containing keyword arguments such as 'sep' for specifying the separator, 'file' for specifying the output stream (defaulting to sys.stdout), 'end' for specifying the ending character (defaulting to a newline), and 'flush' for controlling whether the stream should be flushed after writing.
def func_1():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a variable-length argument list containing integers and strings, `at_start` is False, and the file contains the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by the value of `sep`.

If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, the file has been flushed. Otherwise, the file remains unflushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function prints the values of a variable-length argument list `args` (containing integers and strings) to a specified output stream (`kwargs['file']`, defaulting to `sys.stdout`). It uses a specified separator (`kwargs['sep']`, defaulting to a space) between the values and adds an ending character (`kwargs['end']`, defaulting to a newline) at the end. Additionally, it allows for flushing the output stream (`kwargs['flush']`, defaulting to `False`) after writing. The function does not modify the `args` list or the `kwargs` dictionary. After the function executes, the output stream contains the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by the value of `sep`, followed by the value of `kwargs['end']`. If `kwargs['flush']` is `True`, the output stream is flushed. If `kwargs['flush']` is `False`, the output stream remains unflushed.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `num` is a list of integers, `even_digits` is a deque, and `odd_digits` is a deque. `ret` is a list that contains the smallest even digit encountered so far followed by the smallest odd digit encountered so far for each pair of consecutive iterations where the even digit is smaller. If there are no such pairs, `ret` contains the smallest even digit followed by the smallest odd digit from the entire list.
    return ''.join(map(str, ret))
    #The program returns a string that concatenates the smallest even digit encountered so far followed by the smallest odd digit encountered so far for each pair of consecutive iterations where the even digit is smaller. If there are no such pairs, it returns the smallest even digit followed by the smallest odd digit from the entire list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `num` representing a large integer. It processes this string to extract even and odd digits into separate deques, then constructs a new string by alternating between the smallest available even and odd digits, ensuring that an even digit is placed before an odd digit when both are available and the even digit is smaller. If no such pairs exist, it returns the smallest even digit followed by the smallest odd digit from the entire list. Potential edge cases include strings with only even or only odd digits, or empty input strings. The function handles these cases by appropriately populating and processing the deques.
