The code appends a digit to the `odd_digits` deque. Since the first digit of any integer in `num` is odd, the digit being appended must also be odd. However, the specific value of the digit is not provided, so we cannot specify a concrete value for it. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `even_digits` is an empty deque, `odd_digits` is a deque containing one odd digit, the first digit of any integer in `num` is odd**
