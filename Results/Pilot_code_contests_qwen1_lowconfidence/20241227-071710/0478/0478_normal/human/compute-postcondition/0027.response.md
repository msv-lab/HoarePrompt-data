Postcondition: ***`num` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `even_digits` is a deque, and `odd_digits` is a deque. If `even_digits` is empty or the first element of `even_digits` is less than the first element of `odd_digits`, then `ret` is a list containing the first element of `even_digits` (after `popleft`). Otherwise, the first element of `odd_digits` is removed and appended to `ret`, and `even_digits` remains unchanged while `odd_digits` is unchanged.***
