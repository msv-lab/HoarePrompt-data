Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a string `num` representing a large integer. It processes this string to extract even and odd digits into separate deques, then constructs a new string by alternating between the smallest available even and odd digits, ensuring that an even digit is placed before an odd digit when both are available and the even digit is smaller. If no such pairs exist, it returns the smallest even digit followed by the smallest odd digit from the entire list. Potential edge cases include strings with only even or only odd digits, or empty input strings. The function handles these cases by appropriately populating and processing the deques.**
