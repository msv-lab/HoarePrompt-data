`ret` is appended with the value obtained by calling `popleft()` on `even_digits`. This means that the first element from `even_digits` (a deque) is removed and added to `ret`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers with at least one element, `even_digits` is a deque with at least one less element, `odd_digits` is a deque, and `ret` contains the first element from `even_digits`.**
