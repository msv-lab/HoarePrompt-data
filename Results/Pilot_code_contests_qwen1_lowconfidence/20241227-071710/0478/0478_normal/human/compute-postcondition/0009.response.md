The code appends the `digit` to the `even_digits` deque. The `num` list has already had its first element consumed, so it remains unchanged. The `even_digits` deque is updated with the new digit if it is even, and the `odd_digits` deque remains unchanged unless the `digit` is odd, in which case it would be added.

Since the exact value of `digit` is not specified, we can only say that `even_digits` has been updated with the new digit if it is even. The initial states of `num` and `odd_digits` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers with the first element consumed, `even_digits` is a deque with the updated element if the next digit is even, or the same deque if the next digit is odd, `odd_digits` is the same deque as before**.
