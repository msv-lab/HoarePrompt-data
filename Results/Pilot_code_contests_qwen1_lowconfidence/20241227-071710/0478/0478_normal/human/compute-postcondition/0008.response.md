To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `num` is a list of integers.
   - If the current digit being processed is even, `even_digits` is a deque with this even digit added, and `odd_digits` remains empty.
   - If the current digit is odd, `even_digits` remains empty, and `odd_digits` is a deque containing this odd digit.

2. **For Loop Structure:**
   ```python
   for digit in num:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

Given the structure of the loop and the conditions described, we need to consider what happens at each iteration of the loop:

- If the current digit is even, it gets added to `even_digits`, and `odd_digits` remains unchanged.
- If the current digit is odd, it gets added to `odd_digits`, and `even_digits` remains unchanged.

Since we are at the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- The current digit was either even or odd.
- Based on that, `even_digits` or `odd_digits` (or both) were updated accordingly.

To proceed to the next iteration:
- The next digit from `num` will be processed.
- If the next digit is even, it will be added to `even_digits`.
- If the next digit is odd, it will be added to `odd_digits`.

Therefore, the key state adjustments required are:
- The `num` list will be consumed by one more element (the next digit).
- `even_digits` and `odd_digits` will remain as they were, unless the next digit changes them.

State: **`num` is a list of integers with the first element consumed, `even_digits` is a deque with the same elements as before if the next digit is even, or updated with the next digit if it is even, `odd_digits` is a deque with the same elements as before if the next digit is odd, or updated with the next digit if it is odd.**
