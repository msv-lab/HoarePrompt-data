The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is a string representing a huge integer consisting of `n` digits (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'. The integer may contain leading zeros. The function returns a string that concatenates the smallest even digit encountered so far followed by the smallest odd digit encountered so far for each pair of consecutive iterations where the even digit is smaller. If there are no such pairs, it returns the smallest even digit followed by the smallest odd digit from the entire list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter num, which is a string representing a huge integer. It returns a string that concatenates the smallest even digit followed by the smallest odd digit for each pair of consecutive iterations where the even digit is smaller. If no such pairs exist, it returns the smallest even digit followed by the smallest odd digit from the entire list.**
