Postcondition: ***`num` is a list of integers with at least one element, `even_digits` is a deque, and `odd_digits` is a deque. If `even_digits` is empty or the leftmost element of `even_digits` is smaller than the leftmost element of `odd_digits`, `ret` contains the first element from `even_digits`. Otherwise, `ret` contains the leftmost element of `odd_digits` before it was removed.***
