According to the code, the loop will iterate over each element in the `num` list. For the loop to execute, the `num` list must contain at least one element. The initial states provided are that `num` is a list of integers where each integer is the numeric value of the respective character from the original string `num`, `even_digits` is an empty deque, and `odd_digits` is an empty deque.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that the `num` list contains at least one element. The other variables (`even_digits` and `odd_digits`) being empty deques do not affect the execution of the loop directly, as they will be modified within the loop body.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `num` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
2. The values of `even_digits` and `odd_digits` being empty deques do not impact the loop's ability to run since they will be updated during the loop execution.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure `num` is not empty.

State: **`num` is a list of integers (must contain at least one element), `even_digits` is an empty deque, `odd_digits` is an empty deque**
