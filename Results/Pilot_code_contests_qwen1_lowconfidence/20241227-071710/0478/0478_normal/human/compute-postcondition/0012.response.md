According to the code, the loop iterates over each digit in the list `num`. At the end of the previous iteration, the first element of `num` has been consumed, and the `even_digits` and `odd_digits` deques have been updated based on whether the next digit is even or odd.

Here are the steps to determine the states needed for the next iteration:

1. **Consume the Next Element**: Since the first element of `num` has already been processed, the next element (if available) will be the new first element of `num`.
2. **Update Deques**: The `even_digits` and `odd_digits` deques will be updated based on whether the new digit is even or odd.

Let's assume that the next digit is `x`:

- If `x` is even, `even_digits` will append `x`.
- If `x` is odd, `odd_digits` will append `x`.

Since we don't know the value of `x`, we will represent it generically.

### Step-by-Step Adjustments:

1. **List `num`**: The first element of `num` has been consumed, so the next element (if any) will be the new first element. If `num` had `n` elements initially, now it has `n-1` elements.
2. **Deque `even_digits`**: Updated based on whether the next digit is even or odd.
3. **Deque `odd_digits`**: Updated based on whether the next digit is even or odd.

### Example Answer:

Assuming the next digit is `x`:

- If `x` is even, `even_digits` will append `x`.
- If `x` is odd, `odd_digits` will append `x`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`num` is a list of integers with the first element consumed, `even_digits` is a deque with the updated element if the next digit (x) is even, or the same deque if the next digit is odd, `odd_digits` is a deque that either keeps the same elements as before or appends the `x` to it based on whether the `x` is even or odd**.

For clarity, let's denote `x` explicitly:

- If `x` is even: `even_digits.append(x)`
- If `x` is odd: `odd_digits.append(x)`

Thus, the final state can be written as:

State: **`num` is a list of integers with the first element consumed, `even_digits` is a deque with an additional element if the next digit (x) is even, or the same deque if the next digit is odd, `odd_digits` is a deque with an additional element if the next digit (x) is odd, or the same deque if the next digit is even**.
