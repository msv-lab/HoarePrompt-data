The code initializes two deques, `even_digits` and `odd_digits`. These deques are empty after initialization. The original list `num` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers where each integer is the numeric value of the respective character from the original string `num`; `even_digits` is an empty deque; `odd_digits` is an empty deque.**
