Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `even_digits` is a deque, and `odd_digits` is a deque. `ret` is a list that contains the smallest even digit encountered so far followed by the smallest odd digit encountered so far for each pair of consecutive iterations where the even digit is smaller. If there are no such pairs, `ret` contains the smallest even digit followed by the smallest odd digit from the entire list.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each element in `num` exactly once.
2. **Condition Check**: For each iteration, the loop checks if the leftmost element of `even_digits` is smaller than the leftmost element of `odd_digits`.
3. **Appending to `ret`**:
   - If the condition is met, the leftmost element of `even_digits` is removed and appended to `ret`.
   - If the condition is not met, the leftmost element of `odd_digits` is removed and appended to `ret`.

### Conclusion:
- **Final State of `ret`**: After all iterations, `ret` will contain the smallest even digit followed by the smallest odd digit for each valid pair of consecutive iterations where the even digit is smaller. If there are no such pairs, `ret` will simply contain the smallest even digit followed by the smallest odd digit from the entire list.
- **State of `even_digits` and `odd_digits`**: Both deques will be empty after the loop finishes since all elements will be appended to `ret`.

This ensures that `ret` captures the required sequence based on the specified conditions.
