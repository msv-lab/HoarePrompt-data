The code `odd_digits.append(digit)` appends the `digit` to the `odd_digits` deque. Based on the initial state, the `odd_digits` deque may or may not have an additional element depending on whether the next digit (`x`) is odd or even. The `num` list and `even_digits` deque remain unchanged.

Since the exact value of `digit` is not specified, we will represent the changes in terms of `digit`.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers with the first element consumed, `even_digits` is a deque with an additional element if the next digit (x) is even, or the same deque if the next digit is even, `odd_digits` is a deque with an additional element if the next digit (x) is odd, or the same deque if the next digit is odd, `odd_digits` has an additional element containing `digit`.**
