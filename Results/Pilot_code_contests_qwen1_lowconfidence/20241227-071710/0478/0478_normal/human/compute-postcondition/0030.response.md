The code appends the value of `odd_digits.popleft()` to `ret`. This means that the leftmost element from `odd_digits` (a deque) is removed and appended to `ret`.

- The state of `num` remains unchanged.
- `odd_digits` loses its leftmost element and `ret` gains that element.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers with at least one element, `even_digits` is a deque, and `odd_digits` is a deque with its leftmost element removed; `ret` contains the leftmost element of `odd_digits` before it was removed.**
