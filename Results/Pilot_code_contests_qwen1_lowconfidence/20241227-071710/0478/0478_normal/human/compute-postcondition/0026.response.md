The code appends the first element of `odd_digits` (after removing it) to the list `ret`. Given the conditions in the initial state, we know:

- If `even_digits` is empty or the first element of `even_digits` is less than the first element of `odd_digits`, then `ret` is a list with the first element of `even_digits` appended.
- Otherwise, `ret` is a list containing the first element of `odd_digits`.

Since the code appends `odd_digits.popleft()` to `ret`, regardless of the condition mentioned, the following will happen:

- The first element of `odd_digits` is removed and appended to `ret`.
- The state of `even_digits` and `odd_digits` remains unchanged except for the removal of their respective first elements.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`num` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `even_digits` is a deque, `odd_digits` is a deque, the first element of `odd_digits` is removed and appended to `ret`, `even_digits` is unchanged, and `odd_digits` is unchanged.**
