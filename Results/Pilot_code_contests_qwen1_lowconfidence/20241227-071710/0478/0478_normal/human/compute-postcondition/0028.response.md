According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `num` list. The loop iterates as long as there are elements in the `num` list.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `num` is a list of integers with at least two elements.
- `even_digits` is a deque.
- `odd_digits` is a deque.
- If `even_digits` is empty or the first element of `even_digits` is less than the first element of `odd_digits`, then `ret` contains the first element of `even_digits` (after `popleft`).
- Otherwise, the first element of `odd_digits` is removed and appended to `ret`, and `even_digits` and `odd_digits` remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must have at least one element remaining.

Let's analyze the states step by step:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is a list of integers with at least two elements.
2. Since the loop is iterating over the length of `num`, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must still have at least one element remaining.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `num` has at least one element remaining.

State: **`num` is a list of integers with at least one element, `even_digits` is a deque, and `odd_digits` is a deque.**
