To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given and the logic of the for loop.

### Given Information:
- **`num`**: A list of integers with at least one element.
- **`even_digits`**: A deque.
- **`odd_digits`**: A deque.
- **`ret`**: A list that is updated based on conditions involving `even_digits` and `odd_digits`.

### For Loop:
```
for _ in range(len(num)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition inside the loop checks if `even_digits` is empty or if the first element of `even_digits` is less than the first element of `odd_digits`.
   - If the condition is true, the first element of `even_digits` is appended to `ret`.
   - Otherwise, the first element of `odd_digits` is appended to `ret`.

2. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - We need to determine how the states (`num`, `even_digits`, `odd_digits`, `ret`) change for the next iteration of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `0` to `len(num) - 1`.
   - Each iteration processes an element from `num`.

2. **States to Adjust**:
   - **`num`**: Since the loop iterates over each element of `num`, the length of `num` decreases by 1 with each iteration.
   - **`even_digits` and `odd_digits`**: These deques are not modified within the loop based on the provided information. Therefore, their contents remain unchanged.
   - **`ret`**: The content of `ret` is updated based on the condition inside the loop, but its length is not specified to change. However, we know that `ret` may gain elements based on the condition.

### Conclusion:
- **`num`**: Since the loop iterates over the entire length of `num`, after one iteration, the length of `num` is reduced by 1.
- **`even_digits` and `odd_digits`**: These deques are not modified within the loop, so their states remain the same.
- **`ret`**: The content of `ret` might change, but its length remains the same unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### Final State Adjustment:
State: **`num` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `even_digits` is a deque, and `odd_digits` is a deque. If `even_digits` is empty or the first element of `even_digits` is less than the first element of `odd_digits`, then `ret` is a list with the first element of `even_digits` appended. Otherwise, `ret` is a list containing the first element of `odd_digits`.**

This means for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must have at least two elements, and the states of `even_digits` and `odd_digits` remain unchanged.
