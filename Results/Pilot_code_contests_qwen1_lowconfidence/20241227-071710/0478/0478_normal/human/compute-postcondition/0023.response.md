Postcondition: ***`num` is a list of integers with at least one element, `even_digits` is a deque, and `odd_digits` is a deque. If `even_digits` is empty or the first element of `even_digits` is less than the first element of `odd_digits`, then `ret` is a list with the first element of `even_digits` appended. Otherwise, `ret` is a list containing the first element of `odd_digits`.***
