`ret` appends the first element of `even_digits` after removing it from `even_digits`. Since `even_digits` is a deque and the first element is being removed, the state of `even_digits` changes. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `even_digits` is a deque with its first element removed, `odd_digits` is a deque, `ret` is a list with the first element of `even_digits` appended, and either `odd_digits` is empty or both `even_digits` is not empty and the first element of `even_digits` is less than the first element of `odd_digits`.**
