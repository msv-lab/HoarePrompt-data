The code snippet converts each character in the string `num` to its corresponding integer value using the formula `(ord(x) - ord('0'))`. This means that each character in `num`, which was initially a string of digits, is converted to its numeric equivalent. 

For example, if `num` was "123", after the code is executed, `num` would become `[1, 2, 3]`.

Since the exact value of `num` as a string is not given, we can represent the output in a general form where each element in the list `num` corresponds to the numeric value of the respective character in the original string.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers where each integer is the numeric value of the respective character from the original string `num`.**
