The code `even_digits.append(digit)` appends the `digit` to the `even_digits` deque. The `num` list and `odd_digits` deque remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `num` is a list of integers with the first element consumed.
- `even_digits` is a deque with an additional element if the next digit (x) is even, or the same deque if the next digit is odd.
- `odd_digits` is a deque with an additional element if the next digit (x) is odd, or the same deque if the next digit is even.

After executing the code, the `even_digits` deque will have one more element if the `digit` is even, or will remain the same if the `digit` is odd. The other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers with the first element consumed, `even_digits` is a deque with an additional element if the next digit is even, or the same deque if the next digit is odd, `odd_digits` is a deque with an additional element if the next digit is odd, or the same deque if the next digit is even; `even_digits` is updated if the `digit` is even**
