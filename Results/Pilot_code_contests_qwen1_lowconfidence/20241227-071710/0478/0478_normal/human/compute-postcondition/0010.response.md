The code `odd_digits.append(digit)` appends the `digit` to the `odd_digits` deque. The `even_digits` deque remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. The `num` list is not affected either since it was only mentioned to have its first element consumed, and the current code does not interact with it. Therefore, the only change is in the `odd_digits` deque.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers with the first element consumed, `even_digits` is a deque with the same elements as before, `odd_digits` is a deque with the `digit` appended to it.**
