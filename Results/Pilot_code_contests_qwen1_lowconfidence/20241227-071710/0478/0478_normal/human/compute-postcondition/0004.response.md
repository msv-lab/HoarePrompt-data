The code `even_digits.append(digit)` appends the current digit (which is even) to the `even_digits` deque. Since the current value of the digit being processed is even, this operation will add this even digit to the `even_digits` deque. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `even_digits` is a deque with at least one even digit added and now includes the current even digit, `odd_digits` is an empty deque.**
