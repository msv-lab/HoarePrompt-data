Postcondition: ***`num` is a list of integers with the first element consumed. `even_digits` is a deque with the updated element if the next digit is even, or the same deque if the next digit is odd. `odd_digits` is a deque that either keeps the same elements as before or appends the `digit` to it based on whether the `digit` is even or odd.***
