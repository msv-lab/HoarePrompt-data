According to the code, the loop will iterate over the length of the `num` list. For the loop to execute, the `num` list must have at least one element. The initial states provided are as follows:

- `num` is a list of integers
- `even_digits` is a deque containing all the even digits encountered during the iteration of `num`
- `odd_digits` is a deque containing all the odd digits encountered during the iteration of `num`
- `ret` is an empty list

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `num` has at least one element. The other variables (`even_digits`, `odd_digits`, and `ret`) do not affect the condition for the loop to execute.

State: **`num` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `even_digits` is a deque, `odd_digits` is a deque, `ret` is an empty list**
