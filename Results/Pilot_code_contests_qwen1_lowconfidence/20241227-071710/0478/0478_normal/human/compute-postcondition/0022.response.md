The code `ret.append(odd_digits.popleft())` removes the leftmost element from `odd_digits` and appends it to `ret`. Given the precondition, either `odd_digits` is not empty and `even_digits` is empty, or `even_digits` is not empty and the first element of `even_digits` is greater than or equal to the first element of `odd_digits`.

In both cases, since `odd_digits` is not empty (as per the precondition), the leftmost element of `odd_digits` is removed and appended to `ret`. The value of `ret` becomes a list containing this element.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers with at least one element, `even_digits` is a deque, `odd_digits` is a deque, `ret` is a list containing the first element of `odd_digits`, and either `odd_digits` is now non-empty and `even_digits` is empty, or `even_digits` is not empty and the first element of `even_digits` is greater than or equal to the first element of `odd_digits` (excluding the first element).**
