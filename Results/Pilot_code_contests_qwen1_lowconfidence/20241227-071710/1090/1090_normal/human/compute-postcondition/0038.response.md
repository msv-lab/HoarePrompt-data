The value of `t` is assigned the value of `i - j - 1`. Given the initial values, `i` is 4 and `j` is 3. Therefore, `t` is calculated as `4 - 3 - 1 = 0`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the provided initial state.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1, the second element is 2, the fourth element is 1, and all others are 0; `j` is 3; `i` is 4; `k` is `min(k, arr[ord(str[0]) - ord('a')])`; `t` is 0; `lastMatch[0]` is 1; `maxSubLen` is 3.**
