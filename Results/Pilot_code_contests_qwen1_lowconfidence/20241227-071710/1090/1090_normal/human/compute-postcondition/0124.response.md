Functionality: **The function `func()` takes three inputs: an integer `n`, a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters, and a list `arr` of 26 integers representing the maximum length of substrings each letter ('a' to 'z') can appear in. The function calculates the number of distinct substrings ending at each position of the string `s` modulo `1000000007`, the maximum length of any distinct substring, and the number of unique characters in the string `s`. After executing the loops, the function prints the total number of distinct substrings modulo `1000000007`, the maximum length of any distinct substring, and the number of unique characters in the string `s`.**

- **Input Parameters:** 
  - `n`: An integer such that `1 <= n <= 10^3`.
  - `s`: A string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters.
  - `arr`: A list of 26 integers where each integer `ax` represents the maximum length of substring the `x`-th letter ('a' to 'z') can appear in, and `1 <= ax <= 10^3`.

- **Output:** 
  - Prints three values separated by newlines: 
    - The total number of distinct substrings of `s` ending at each position modulo `1000000007`.
    - The maximum length of any distinct substring found during the execution.
    - The number of unique characters in the string `s`.

- **Potential Edge Cases:**
  - If `n` is `1`, the string `s` has only one character, and thus, the number of distinct substrings is `1`, and the maximum length of any distinct substring is `1`.
  - If `arr` is such that no character can form a substring longer than `1`, then the maximum length of any distinct substring will be `1`.

- **Missing Functionality:**
  - The function does not handle cases where the input string `s` might contain special characters or numbers, although the problem statement assumes lowercase English letters.
  - The function does not explicitly check for invalid inputs such as `n` outside the range `[1, 10^3]` or `arr` not having exactly 26 elements.
