To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the `while` loop will continue iterating. The loop continues as long as both conditions are true:

1. `j <= k`
2. `i - j >= 0`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` is 2
- `t` is `i - 2`
- `k` is the minimum of its current value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be less than or equal to `k`
- `i - j` must be greater than or equal to 0

Let's break this down:

1. **Condition `j <= k`:**
   - Currently, `j` is 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `k` must be at least 2.

2. **Condition `i - j >= 0`:**
   - Currently, `j` is 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be at least 2.

Since `j` is 2, the second condition (`i - j >= 0`) simplifies to `i >= 2`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` must be at least 2
- `i` must be at least 2

The updated state is:
State: **`dp[0]` is 1, `dp[i]` for `i` from `1` to `len(s)` is `2 * i % MOD`, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers, `arr` is a list of evaluated results, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where `lastMatch[i]` is the last occurrence index of the character corresponding to `str[i]` in the substring from `0` to `i-1`, `maxSubLen` is the maximum length of a distinct substring found so far, `j` is 2, `t` is `i - 2`, `k` must be at least 2, `i` must be at least 2**
