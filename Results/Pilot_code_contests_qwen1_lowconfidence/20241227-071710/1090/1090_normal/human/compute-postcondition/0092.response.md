The code updates the value of `maxSubLen` to be the maximum between `j` and the current value of `maxSubLen`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `maxSubLen`, we assume it could be any value. After the code executes, `maxSubLen` will be updated to the maximum of `j` and the original value of `maxSubLen`.

Output State: **`k` must be at least `j`, and `i` must be at least `j + 1`; `maxSubLen` is the maximum of `j` and the original value of `maxSubLen`**
