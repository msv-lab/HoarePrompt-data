The code `maxSubLen = max(j, maxSubLen)` updates the value of `maxSubLen` to be the maximum of `j` and the current value of `maxSubLen`. Given the initial state, `j` is 3, and `maxSubLen` is initially unspecified but should be assumed to be 0 (as no previous value is given).

- Initially, `maxSubLen` is 0.
- After executing the code, `maxSubLen` is updated to be the maximum of `j` (which is 3) and `maxSubLen` (which is 0), resulting in `maxSubLen` being 3.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1, the second element is 2, and all others are 0; `j` is 3; `i` must be at least 4; `k` is `min(k, arr[ord(str[0]) - ord('a')])`; `t` is 0; `lastMatch[0]` is 1; `maxSubLen` is 3.**
