The variable `t` is assigned the value of `i - j - 1`. Given the initial values `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, the calculation for `t` is:

\[ t = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 \]

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n`, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers, `arr` is a list of evaluated results, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1 and all others are 0 except `dp[i]` which is now 1, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where all elements are set to the value of `len(lastMatch) - 1`, `maxSubLen` is 1, `j` is 1, `i` is 1, `k` must be at least 1, `t` is -1**
