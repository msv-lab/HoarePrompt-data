The code `maxSubLen = max(j, maxSubLen)` updates the value of `maxSubLen` to be the maximum of `j` and the current value of `maxSubLen`. Since `j` is initialized to 1 and `maxSubLen` is the maximum length of a distinct substring found so far, the value of `maxSubLen` will be updated to be the larger of 1 and the current `maxSubLen`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\)
- `s` is a string of length `n`
- `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers
- `arr` is a list of evaluated results
- `MOD` is 1000000007.0
- `dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1, and `dp[i]` for `i` up to `len(s)` contains the number of distinct substrings of `s` ending at each position modulo `MOD`
- `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where `lastMatch[i]` is the last occurrence index of the character corresponding to `str[i]` in the substring from `0` to `i-1`
- `maxSubLen` is the maximum length of a distinct substring found so far
- `j` is 1
- `i` is the original value of `i + 1`
- `k` must be at least 1
- `t` is 0

After executing the line `maxSubLen = max(j, maxSubLen)`, the new value of `maxSubLen` will be the maximum of the current `maxSubLen` and `j` (which is 1).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n`, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers, `arr` is a list of evaluated results, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1, and `dp[i]` for `i` up to `len(s)` contains the number of distinct substrings of `s` ending at each position modulo `MOD`, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where `lastMatch[i]` is the last occurrence index of the character corresponding to `str[i]` in the substring from `0` to `i-1`, `maxSubLen` is the maximum of the current `maxSubLen` and 1, `j` is 1, `i` is the original value of `i + 1`, `k` must be at least 1, and `t` is 0.**
