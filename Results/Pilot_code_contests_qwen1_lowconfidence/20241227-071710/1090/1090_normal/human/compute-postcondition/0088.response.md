`t` is assigned the value of `t` if `t` is greater than 0, otherwise `t` is assigned 0. Since `t` is at least 0, the condition `t > 0` will always be true, and thus `t` remains unchanged. All other variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n`, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers, `arr` is a list of evaluated results, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1 and `dp[i]` for `i` from `j` to `len(s)` is updated according to the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where `lastMatch[t + 1]` is now 1, `maxSubLen` is at least 2, `i` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `t` is at least 0.**
