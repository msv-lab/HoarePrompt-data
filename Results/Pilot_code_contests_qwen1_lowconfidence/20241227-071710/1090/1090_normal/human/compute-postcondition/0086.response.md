`t` is assigned the value `i - j - 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is at least 2 and `j` is 2. Therefore, `t` will be at least 0. 

The output state will reflect this calculation and keep the rest of the variables unchanged since no other operations are performed on them.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n`, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers, `arr` is a list of evaluated results, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1 and `dp[i]` for `i` from `j` to `len(s)` is updated according to the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where `lastMatch[i - 1]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`, `maxSubLen` is at least 2, `i` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `t` is at least 0.**
