`n` is assigned the value `input()`, which is expected to be an integer within the range of 1 to 10^3. The states of `s` and the list `a1, a2, ..., a26` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 10^3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters, and `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers where each integer `ax` represents the maximum length of substring the x-th letter ('a' to 'z') can appear in and satisfies 1 <= `ax` <= 10^3.
Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 10^3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters, and `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers where each integer `ax` represents the maximum length of substring the x-th letter ('a' to 'z') can appear in and satisfies 1 <= `ax` <= 10^3.**
