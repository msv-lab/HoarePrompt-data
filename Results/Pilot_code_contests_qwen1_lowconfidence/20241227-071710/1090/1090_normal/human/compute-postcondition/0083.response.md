To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```python
while j <= k and i - j >= 0:
```

Let's break down the conditions:
1. `j <= k`: This ensures that `j` is not greater than `k`.
2. `i - j >= 0`: This ensures that `i - j` is a non-negative number.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` is 2.
- `i` is `i + 1`, meaning `i` was `i - 1` in the previous iteration.
- `k` is `min(k, arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')])`.
- `t` is 1.

Given these details, we need to check if the loop can execute one more time based on the values of `j` and `i - j`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Check `j <= k`:**
   - The value of `j` is 2.
   - The value of `k` is `min(k, arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')])`. Since `t` is 1, `arr[ord(str[1]) - ord('a')]` will be some integer from the list `arr`. For the loop to continue, `k` must be at least 2 (since `j` is 2).

2. **Check `i - j >= 0`:**
   - The value of `i` is `i + 1` in the next iteration, meaning `i` was `i - 1` in the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, `i - j` must be non-negative for the loop to continue.
   - Since `j` is 2, `i` must be at least 2 for `i - j` to be non-negative.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time:
- `k` must be at least 2.
- `i` must be at least 2.

Therefore, we need to adjust the states to ensure these conditions are met.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n`, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers, `arr` is a list of evaluated results, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1 and `dp[i]` for `i` up to `len(s)` contains the number of distinct substrings of `s` ending at each position modulo `MOD`, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where `lastMatch[i - 1]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`, `maxSubLen` is the maximum of the current `maxSubLen` and 1, `i` must be at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` must be at least 2, `t` is 1.**
