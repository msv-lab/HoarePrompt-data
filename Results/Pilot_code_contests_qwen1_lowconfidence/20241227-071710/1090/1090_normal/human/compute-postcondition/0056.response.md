The code snippet updates the `maxSubLen` variable to be the maximum of `j` and `maxSubLen`. Given the initial state, the value of `j` is 2 and `maxSubLen` is the maximum length of a distinct substring found so far, which is currently unknown but must be at least 2 (since `j` is 2 and `j` must be at least 2).

Since `j` is 2 and it is the first assignment to `maxSubLen`, unless `maxSubLen` was previously greater than 2, the new value of `maxSubLen` will be 2. Therefore, the updated value of `maxSubLen` is 2.

Output State: **`dp[0]` is 1, `dp[i]` for `i` from `1` to `len(s)` is `2 * i % MOD`, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers, `arr` is a list of evaluated results, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where `lastMatch[i]` is the last occurrence index of the character corresponding to `str[i]` in the substring from `0` to `i-1`, `maxSubLen` is 2, `j` is 2, `t` is `i - 2`, `k` must be at least 2, `i` must be at least 2.**
