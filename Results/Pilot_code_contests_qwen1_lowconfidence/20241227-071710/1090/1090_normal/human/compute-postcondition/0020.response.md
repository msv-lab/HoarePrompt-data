The code `maxSubLen = max(j, maxSubLen)` updates the value of `maxSubLen` to be the maximum of the current values of `j` and `maxSubLen`. Since the initial value of `maxSubLen` is 0 and `j` is initially 1, the new value of `maxSubLen` will be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n`, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers, `arr` is a list of evaluated results, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1 and all others are 0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where all elements are set to the value of `len(lastMatch) - 1`, `maxSubLen` is 1, `j` is 1, `i` must be at least 1, `k` must be at least 1**
