The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `subNum`. This is the only assignment in the snippet, and it does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n`, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers, `arr` is a list of evaluated results, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1 and `dp[i]` for `i` from `1` to `len(s)` contains the number of distinct substrings of `s` ending at each position modulo `MOD`, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where `lastMatch[i]` is the maximum index in the string `s` where the character corresponding to `str[i]` appears, `maxSubLen` is the maximum length of any distinct substring found during the loop execution, `j` is the final value of `j` after the loop exits, `i` is the final value of `i` after the loop exits, `k` is the minimum value of `k` and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]` at the end of the loop, `t` is 0 if `i - j - 1` is less than 0, otherwise `t` is `i - j - 1`; `lastIndex` is 0, `lastStrIndex` is `n - 1`, `subNum` is 0.**
