The code `arr = raw_input().split()` takes user input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The previous values of the variables are as follows: `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers where each integer `ax` represents the maximum length of substring the x-th letter ('a' to 'z') can appear in and satisfies 1 <= `ax` <= \(10^3\), and `str` is the same as `s`. After running the code, the list `arr` will contain the split elements from the user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers where each integer `ax` represents the maximum length of substring the x-th letter ('a' to 'z') can appear in and satisfies 1 <= `ax` <= \(10^3\), `str` is the same as `s`, `arr` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the user input.**
