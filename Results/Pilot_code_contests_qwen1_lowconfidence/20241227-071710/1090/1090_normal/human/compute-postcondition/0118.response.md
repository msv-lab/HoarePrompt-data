The code `lastIndex += 1` increments the value of `lastIndex` by 1. Given that `lastIndex` was previously updated to `n - 1`, incrementing it by 1 means that `lastIndex` is now `n`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the provided initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n`, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers, `arr` is a list of evaluated results, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1 and `dp[i]` for `i` from `1` to `len(s)` contains the number of distinct substrings of `s` ending at each position modulo `MOD`, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where `lastMatch[i]` is the maximum index in the string `s` where the character corresponding to `str[i]` appears, `maxSubLen` is the maximum length of any distinct substring found during the loop execution, `j` is the final value of `j` after the loop exits, `i` is the final value of `i` after the loop exits, `k` is the minimum value of `k` and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]` at the end of the loop, `t` is 0 if `i - j - 1` is less than 0, otherwise `t` is `i - j - 1`, `lastIndex` is `n - 1 + 1 = n`, `subNum` is 1**
