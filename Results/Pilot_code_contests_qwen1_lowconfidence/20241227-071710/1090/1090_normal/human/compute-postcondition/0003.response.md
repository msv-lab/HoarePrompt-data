The code `arr = map(eval, arr)` applies the `eval` function to each element in the list `arr`. However, the initial state does not provide the actual content of `arr`, only that it is a list of strings obtained from splitting the user input. Since the exact contents of `arr` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact changes made by `map(eval, arr)`. The only thing we know for sure is that the `arr` variable now contains the evaluated results of its elements.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\),
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters,
- `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers where each integer `ax` represents the maximum length of substring the x-th letter ('a' to 'z') can appear in and satisfies 1 <= `ax` <= \(10^3\),
- `str` is the same as `s`,
- `arr` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the user input,

After executing `arr = map(eval, arr)`, the values of `n`, `s`, `a1, a2, ..., a26`, and `str` remain unchanged, but `arr` is updated to contain the evaluated results of its original elements.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters; `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers where each integer `ax` represents the maximum length of substring the x-th letter ('a' to 'z') can appear in and satisfies 1 <= `ax` <= \(10^3\); `str` is the same as `s`; `arr` is a list of evaluated results of its original elements.**
