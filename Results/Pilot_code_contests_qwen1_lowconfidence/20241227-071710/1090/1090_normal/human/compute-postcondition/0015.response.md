The variable `maxSubLen` is assigned the value `0`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the `n`, `s`, `a1, a2, ..., a26`, `str`, `arr`, `MOD`, `dp`, and `lastMatch` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers where each integer `ax` represents the maximum length of substring the x-th letter ('a' to 'z') can appear in and satisfies 1 <= `ax` <= \(10^3\), `str` is the same as `s`, `arr` is a list of evaluated results of its original elements, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1 and all others are 0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where all elements are set to the value of `len(lastMatch) - 1`; `maxSubLen` is 0.**
