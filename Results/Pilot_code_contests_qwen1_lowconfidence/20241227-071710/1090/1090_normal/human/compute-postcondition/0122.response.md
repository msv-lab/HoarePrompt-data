The provided code snippet is a simple print statement that outputs three values: `dp[len(str)]`, `maxSubLen`, and `subNum`. Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. `dp[len(str)]`: This accesses the last element of the `dp` list, which is `dp[-1]`. Since `dp` is initialized such that `dp[0] = 1` and the length of `s` is `n`, the last element of `dp` is `dp[n-1]`.
2. `maxSubLen`: This variable retains its value from before the print statement because no operation is performed on it here.
3. `subNum`: This variable also retains its value from before the print statement because no operation is performed on it here.

Since the print statement does not modify any variables, the only changes are in the output of the variables mentioned. The output will be the values of `dp[n-1]`, `maxSubLen`, and `subNum`.

Output State: **`dp[n-1]`, `maxSubLen`, `subNum`**
