`j` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` was previously `1`, so now it is `2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n`, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers, `arr` is a list of evaluated results, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1 and `dp[i]` for `i` up to `len(s)` contains the number of distinct substrings of `s` ending at each position modulo `MOD`, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where `lastMatch[i - 1]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`, `maxSubLen` is the maximum of the current `maxSubLen` and 1, `j` is 2, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is `min(k, arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')])`, `t` is 1.**
