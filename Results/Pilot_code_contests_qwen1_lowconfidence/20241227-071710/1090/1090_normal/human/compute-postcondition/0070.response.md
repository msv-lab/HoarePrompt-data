`j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. 

Output State: **`lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to be `max(lastMatch[t + 1], i - 1)`, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[i]` for `i` from `1` to `len(s)` is `(2 * i - dp[i - 2]) % MOD`, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers, `arr` is a list of evaluated results, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where `lastMatch[i]` is the last occurrence index of the character corresponding to `str[i]` in the substring from `0` to `i-1`, `maxSubLen` is 2, `j` is 2, `t` is `t if t > 0 else 0`, `k` is the minimum of its original value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`, `i` must be such that `i >= 1`.**
