The code `lastMatch[i] = i` assigns the value of `i` to the `i`-th element of the `lastMatch` list. Given the initial state, `i` is defined as `previous_i + 1`, and `lastMatch` is initially set such that the `(i + 1)`-th element is `(i + 1)` and all other elements are 0.

After executing the line `lastMatch[i] = i`, the `i`-th element of `lastMatch` will be updated to `i`. All other elements in `lastMatch` remain unchanged because they were already set to 0 and no assignment operation was performed on them except for the `(i + 1)`-th element which was already correctly initialized.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters; `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers; `str` is the same as `s`; `arr` is a list of evaluated results of its original elements; `MOD` is 1000000007.0; `dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1 and all others are 0; `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where the `i`-th element is `i` and all other elements are 0; `i` is `previous_i + 1`.**
