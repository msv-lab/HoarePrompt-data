The code `t = t if t > 0 else 0` checks if `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is greater than 0, `t` remains unchanged; otherwise, `t` is set to 0. Given the initial state, `t` is -1, which is not greater than 0. Therefore, `t` will be set to 0.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1, the second element is 2, and all others are 0; `j` is 2; `i` is 2; `k` is `min(k, arr[ord(str[0]) - ord('a')]); `t` is 0; `lastMatch[0]` is 1.**
