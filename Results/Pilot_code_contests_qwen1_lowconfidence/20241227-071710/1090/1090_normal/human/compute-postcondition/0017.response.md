The variable `j` is assigned the value 1. This initializes `j` to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\); `s` (or `str`) is a string of length `n` with `len(s) >= 1`; `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers where each integer `ax` represents the maximum length of substring the x-th letter ('a' to 'z') can appear in and satisfies 1 <= `ax` <= \(10^3\); `arr` is a list of evaluated results of its original elements; `MOD` is 1000000007.0; `dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1 and all others are 0; `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where all elements are set to the value of `len(lastMatch) - 1`; `maxSubLen` is 0; `j` is 1.**
