`t` is assigned the value `i - j - 1`. According to the precondition, `i` must be at least 2 and `j` is 2, so `t` will be calculated as `i - 2 - 1 = i - 3`.

The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[i]` for `i` from `1` to `len(s)` is `(2 * i - dp[i - 2]) % MOD`, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers, `arr` is a list of evaluated results, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where `lastMatch[i]` is the last occurrence index of the character corresponding to `str[i]` in the substring from `0` to `i-1`, `maxSubLen` is 2, `j` is 2, `t` is `i - 3`, `k` must be at least 2, `i` must be at least 2.
