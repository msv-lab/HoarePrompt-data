The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Initially, `j` is 2, so after executing the code, `j` will be 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1, the second element is 2, and all others are 0; `j` is 3; `i` is 2; `k` is `min(k, arr[ord(str[0]) - ord('a')])`; `t` is 0; `lastMatch[0]` is 1.**
