To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the given states.

The loop condition is:
```python
while lastIndex != lastStrIndex:
```

Given the states:
- `lastIndex` is not equal to `n - 1`.
- `lastStrIndex` is `n - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `lastIndex` must be set to a value such that `lastIndex != lastStrIndex` still holds true. Currently, `lastStrIndex` is fixed at `n - 1`, so the only way to satisfy the loop condition is to ensure `lastIndex` is still not `n - 1`.

Therefore, we need to adjust `lastIndex` to be equal to `n - 1` to ensure the loop will not execute again, but since we need to allow the loop to continue, `lastIndex` should be set to a value that is not `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n`, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers, `arr` is a list of evaluated results, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1 and `dp[i]` for `i` from `1` to `len(s)` contains the number of distinct substrings of `s` ending at each position modulo `MOD`, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where `lastMatch[i]` is the maximum index in the string `s` where the character corresponding to `str[i]` appears, `maxSubLen` is the maximum length of any distinct substring found during the loop execution, `j` is the final value of `j` after the loop exits, `i` is the final value of `i` after the loop exits, `k` is the minimum value of `k` and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]` at the end of the loop, `t` is 0 if `i - j - 1` is less than 0, otherwise `t` is `i - j - 1`, `lastIndex` is updated to `n - 1`, and `lastIndex` is not equal to `n - 1`**.
