`t` is assigned the value of `i - j - 1`. Given the initial values, `i` is 2 and `j` is 2, so `t` becomes `2 - 2 - 1 = -1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1, the second element is 2, and all others are 0; `j` is 2, `i` is 2, `k` is `min(k, arr[ord(str[0]) - ord('a')]); `t` is -1**
