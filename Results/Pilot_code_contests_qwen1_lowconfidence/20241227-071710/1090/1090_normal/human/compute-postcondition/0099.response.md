Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n`, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers, `arr` is a list of evaluated results, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1 and `dp[i]` for `i` up to `len(s)` contains the number of distinct substrings of `s` ending at each position modulo `MOD`, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where `lastMatch[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`, `maxSubLen` is the maximum length of a distinct substring found during the entire execution of the loop, `j` is the final value determined by the loop, `i` is the final value determined by the loop, `k` is the minimum value of `k` and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]` at the end of the loop, `t` is 0 if `i - j - 1` is 0 or less, otherwise `t` is `i - j - 1`.**
