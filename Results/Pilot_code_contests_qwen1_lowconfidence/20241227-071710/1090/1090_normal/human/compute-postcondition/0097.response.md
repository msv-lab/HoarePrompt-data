The code updates the value of `k` to the minimum between the current value of `k` and the value of `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`. The other variables are not affected.

- `k` is updated to `min(k, arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')])`.
- The values of `j`, `i`, `maxSubLen`, `dp[i]`, `t`, and `lastMatch[t + 1]` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`k` is updated to `min(k, arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')])`, `j` must be at least `j`, `i` must be at least `j + 1`, `maxSubLen` is the maximum of `j` and the original value of `maxSubLen`, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `t` is 0 if `i - j - 1` is 0 or less, `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`**.
