The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n`, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers, `arr` is a list of evaluated results, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1 and all others are 0 except `dp[i]` which is now 1, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where `lastMatch[0]` is 3199 and all other elements are set to the value of `len(lastMatch) - 1`, `maxSubLen` is 1, `j` is 2, `i` is 1, `k` is `min(k, arr[ord(str[0]) - ord('a')]), `t` is 0.
