`t` is assigned the value of `i - j - 1`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `dp[i]` are used in this calculation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` must be at least `j`, `i` must be at least `j + 1`, `maxSubLen` is the maximum of `j` and the original value of `maxSubLen`, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `t` is `i - j - 1`**
