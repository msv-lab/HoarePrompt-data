To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the current values of the relevant variables.

The loop condition is:
\[ \text{while } j \leq k \text{ and } i - j \geq 0 \]

At the end of the previous iteration:
- \( k \) is the minimum of its previous value and \( \text{arr}[\text{ord(str}[t]\text{)} - \text{ord('a')}] \)
- \( n \) is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\)
- \( s \) is a string of length \( n \)
- \( a1, a2, \ldots, a26 \) is a list of 26 integers
- \( \text{arr} \) is a list of evaluated results
- \( \text{MOD} \) is 1000000007.0
- \( \text{dp} \) is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1 and \( \text{dp}[i] \) for \( i \) from \( j \) to \( \text{len}(s) \) is updated according to the formula \( \text{dp}[i] = (\text{dp}[i] + \text{dp}[i - j]) \% \text{MOD} \)
- \( \text{lastMatch} \) is a list of 3200 elements, where \( \text{lastMatch}[t + 1] \) is now 1
- \( \text{maxSubLen} \) is at least 2
- \( i \) is at least 2
- \( j \) is at least 3
- \( t \) is at least 0

### Analysis:

1. **Condition \( j \leq k \)**:
   - \( k \) is the minimum of its previous value and \( \text{arr}[\text{ord(str}[t]\text{)} - \text{ord('a')}] \).
   - To ensure \( j \leq k \), we need to adjust \( k \) to be at least \( j \).

2. **Condition \( i - j \geq 0 \)**:
   - This condition is always true given that \( i \) is at least 2 and \( j \) is at least 3, but to be thorough, we should ensure \( i \) is large enough to allow \( j \) to decrement without going negative.

### Adjusted States:

- **\( k \)**: Since \( j \leq k \) must hold, \( k \) needs to be adjusted to be at least \( j \). Therefore, \( k \) should be adjusted to be \( j \) or more.
- **\( i \)**: Although \( i \) is at least 2, we don't need to explicitly adjust \( i \) as long as \( j \leq i \) remains true. However, to be precise, \( i \) should be at least \( j + 1 \) to ensure \( i - j \geq 0 \).

### Final State:

State: **`k` must be at least `j`, and `i` must be at least `j + 1`**

This ensures that the loop condition \( j \leq k \) and \( i - j \geq 0 \) will be satisfied for the next iteration.
