The code `t = t if t > 0 else 0` checks if `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is greater than 0, `t` remains unchanged. If `t` is not greater than 0 (i.e., `t` is 0 or negative), `t` is set to 0. Given the initial state where `t` is 0, the condition `t > 0` evaluates to False, so `t` will be set to 0.

Here are the updated values after executing the code:
- `dp` remains the same: a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1, the second element is 2, the fourth element is 1, all others are 0.
- `j` remains the same: 3.
- `i` remains the same: 4.
- `lastMatch[0]` remains the same: 1.
- `lastMatch[1]` remains the same: 3.
- `maxSubLen` remains the same: 3.
- `t` is now 0.
- `k` remains the same: `min(k, arr[ord(str[0]) - ord('a')])`.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1, the second element is 2, the fourth element is 1, all others are 0; `j` is 3; `i` is 4; `lastMatch[0]` is 1; `lastMatch[1]` is 3; `maxSubLen` is 3; `t` is 0; `k` is `min(k, arr[ord(str[0]) - ord('a')])`.**
