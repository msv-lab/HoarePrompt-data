The code snippet assigns the value of `arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]` to `k`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its name to `i`, but the exact value of `i` is not given. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n`, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers, `arr` is a list of evaluated results, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1, and `dp[i]` for `i` up to `len(s)` contains the number of distinct substrings of `s` ending at each position modulo `MOD`, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where `lastMatch[i]` is the last occurrence index of the character corresponding to `str[i]` in the substring from `0` to `i-1`, `maxSubLen` is the maximum length of a distinct substring found so far, `j` is 1, `i` is the original value of `i + 1`, `k` is `arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')], and `t` is 0.**
