The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Given the initial state, the only variable affected by this code is `j`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `j` was initially 1, so after executing the code, `j` will be 2.

Output State: **`dp[0]` is 1, `dp[i]` for `i` from `1` to `len(s)` is `2 * i % MOD`, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers, `arr` is a list of evaluated results, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where `lastMatch[i]` is the last occurrence index of the character corresponding to `str[i]` in the substring from `0` to `i-1`, `maxSubLen` is the maximum length of a distinct substring found so far, `j` is 2, `t` is `i - 2`, `k` is the minimum of its current value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`
