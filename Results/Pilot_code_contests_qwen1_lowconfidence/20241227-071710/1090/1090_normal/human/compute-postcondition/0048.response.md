The code updates the value of `maxSubLen` to be the maximum of `j` and `maxSubLen`. Given the initial conditions:

- `j` must be 1.
- `maxSubLen` is the maximum length of a distinct substring found so far.

Since `j` is 1, and `maxSubLen` is the maximum length of a distinct substring found so far (which is also the initial value before any comparisons), `maxSubLen` will be updated to the maximum of 1 and the current `maxSubLen`.

If `maxSubLen` was already greater than or equal to 1, it remains unchanged. If `maxSubLen` was less than 1, it will be set to 1.

However, since `maxSubLen` is initially the maximum length of a distinct substring found so far and it is not specified what that value is, we assume it is at least 1 (as it would be if there is any valid substring). Therefore, `maxSubLen` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n`, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers, `arr` is a list of evaluated results, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1, and `dp[i]` for `i` up to `len(s)` contains the number of distinct substrings of `s` ending at each position modulo `MOD`, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where `lastMatch[i]` is the last occurrence index of the character corresponding to `str[i]` in the substring from `0` to `i-1`, `maxSubLen` is the maximum length of a distinct substring found so far, `j` is 1, and `maxSubLen` remains unchanged.**
