The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. This operation does not affect the values of `k`, `i`, `maxSubLen`, `dp`, `t`, or `lastMatch`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `j`.

Output State: **`k` is updated to `min(k, arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')])`, `j` is increased by 1, `i` must be at least `j + 1`, `maxSubLen` is the maximum of `j` and the original value of `maxSubLen`, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `t` is 0 if `i - j - 1` is 0 or less, `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`**
