The code snippet updates `maxSubLen` to be the maximum of `j` and the current `maxSubLen`. Since `j` is initialized to 2 (as per the precondition) and `maxSubLen` is at least 2 (as stated in the precondition), `maxSubLen` will be updated to the maximum of `j` (which is 2) and the current `maxSubLen` (which is also at least 2). Therefore, `maxSubLen` remains at least 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n`, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers, `arr` is a list of evaluated results, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1 and `dp[i]` for `i` up to `len(s)` contains the number of distinct substrings of `s` ending at each position modulo `MOD`, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where `lastMatch[i - 1]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`, `maxSubLen` is at least 2, `i` must be at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` must be at least 2, `t` is 1.**
