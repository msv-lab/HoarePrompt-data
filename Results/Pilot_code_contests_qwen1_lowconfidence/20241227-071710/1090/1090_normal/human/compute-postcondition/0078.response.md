`t` is assigned the value of `i - j - 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n`, `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers, `arr` is a list of evaluated results, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements, where the first element is 1 and `dp[i]` for `i` up to `len(s)` contains the number of distinct substrings of `s` ending at each position modulo `MOD`, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements, where `lastMatch[i]` is the last occurrence index of the character corresponding to `str[i]` in the substring from `0` to `i-1`, `maxSubLen` is the maximum of the current `maxSubLen` and 1, `j` is 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` must be at least 1, and `t` is `i - j - 1`.
