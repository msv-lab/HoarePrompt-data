The function `func()` takes three inputs: an integer `n`, a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters, and a list `arr` of 26 integers representing the maximum length of substrings each letter ('a' to 'z') can appear in. The function calculates the number of distinct substrings ending at each position of the string `s` modulo `1000000007`, the maximum length of any distinct substring, and the number of unique characters in the string `s`. After executing the loops, the function prints the total number of distinct substrings modulo `1000000007`, the maximum length of any distinct substring, and the number of unique characters in the string `s`.
