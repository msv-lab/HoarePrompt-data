Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the code calculates the number of ways to split the string and the maximum length of a substring, but it fails to correctly determine the minimum number of substrings needed. Additionally, the logic for calculating the number of ways to split the string seems to be incomplete and incorrect.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Number of Substrings:**
   - The code attempts to calculate the minimum number of substrings by incrementing `subNum` whenever `lastIndex` is not equal to `lastMatch[lastIndex]`. However, this approach does not correctly account for all valid splits. The logic here is flawed because it only considers certain transitions between indices without fully exploring all possible valid splits.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Maximum Substring Length:**
   - While the code updates `maxSubLen` within the loop, it does not seem to be correctly tracking the maximum length of a valid substring. The variable `k` is reset to the minimum of the current value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`, which might not capture the true maximum length of a valid substring in all cases.

3. **Overall Splitting Logic:**
   - The overall logic for splitting the string into valid substrings and counting the number of ways to do so is not fully implemented. The code uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to count valid splits but does not correctly initialize or update the DP array to reflect all possible valid splits.

### Example Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
3
aab
2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

- **Expected Output:**
  - Number of ways: 3
  - Maximum length of a substring: 2
  - Minimum number of substrings: 2

- **Actual Output:**
  - The code might incorrectly output different values due to the flawed logic described above.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
