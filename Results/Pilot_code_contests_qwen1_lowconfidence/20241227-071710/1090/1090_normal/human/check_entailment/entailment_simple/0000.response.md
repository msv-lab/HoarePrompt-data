Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Ways to Split the String:**
   - The program uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to calculate the number of ways to split the string. However, the implementation is flawed.
   - The state transition in the `dp` array is incorrect. Specifically, the line `dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD` should consider all possible splits, but the logic inside the while loop is not correctly reflecting the constraints.
   - The variable `lastMatch` is not used effectively to track the last occurrence of characters, which is crucial for determining valid splits.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Length Substring:**
   - The variable `maxSubLen` is supposed to store the maximum length of any valid substring. However, the current implementation does not correctly update `maxSubLen` based on the valid splits.
   - The logic to update `maxSubLen` should be based on the valid splits identified, but the current implementation is flawed.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Number of Substrings:**
   - The variable `subNum` is supposed to store the minimum number of substrings. However, the current implementation does not correctly compute this value.
   - The logic to update `subNum` should reflect the minimum number of substrings needed to satisfy the conditions, but the current implementation is flawed.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization:**
   - Initialize `dp[i]` to 1 for all `i` up to `n`, indicating one way to split an empty substring.
   - Initialize `lastMatch` to keep track of the last occurrence of each character.

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition:**
   - Iterate through the string and for each position `i`, consider all possible splits up to the allowed length for each character.
   - Update `dp[i]` based on valid splits and ensure that the splits adhere to the magical paper constraints.

3. **Track Maximum Length Substring:**
   - While iterating, track the maximum length of any valid substring.

4. **Track Minimum Number of Substrings:**
   - Use a separate counter to track the minimum number of substrings needed.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from __future__ import print_function

def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    MOD = 1000000007
    
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    lastMatch = [0] * 26
    
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i + 1] = dp[i]
        maxSubLen = 0
        for j in range(1, min(n - i + 1, arr[ord(s[i]) - ord('a')]) + 1):
            if lastMatch[ord(s[i]) - ord('a')] >= i - j + 1:
                break
            maxSubLen = max(maxSubLen, j)
            dp[i + 1] = (dp[i + 1] + dp[i + 1 - j]) % MOD
            lastMatch[ord(s[i]) - ord('a')] = i + 1
    
    # Calculate maximum length substring
    maxSubLen = max(maxSubLen, 1)
    
    # Calculate minimum number of substrings
    subNum = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if dp[i] == 0:
            subNum += 1
    
    print(dp[n], maxSubLen, subNum, sep='\n')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the dynamic programming transitions are correctly handled and adheres to the problem constraints.
