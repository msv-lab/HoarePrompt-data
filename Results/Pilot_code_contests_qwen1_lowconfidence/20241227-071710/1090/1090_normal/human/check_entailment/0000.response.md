Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `n`**: The variable `n` is read as a string using `input()`, which should be converted to an integer using `int(input())`.

2. **Use of `raw_input` and `eval`**: The program uses `raw_input()` and `map(eval, arr)` which are not necessary and could cause issues. Instead, simply use `input()` to read the length of the string and `map(int, arr)` to convert the list of maximum lengths to integers.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Substring Length (`maxSubLen`)**: The current implementation does not correctly calculate the maximum length of a substring. It should consider the maximum length for each character individually.

4. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Minimum Number of Substrings (`subNum`)**: The logic for counting the minimum number of substrings is flawed. It should iterate through the string and split it based on the maximum allowed length for each character.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from __future__ import print_function

def func():
    n = int(input())
    str = input()
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    MOD = 1000000000 + 7
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    max_sub_len = 0
    min_sub_num = float('inf')
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1]
        for j in range(1, min(i + 1, arr[ord(str[i-1]) - ord('a')] + 1)):
            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i-j]) % MOD
            max_sub_len = max(max_sub_len, j)
        
        # Find the minimum number of substrings
        if dp[i] != 0:
            min_sub_num = min(min_sub_num, i)

    print(dp[n], max_sub_len, min_sub_num, sep='\n')

func()
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned above and should work according to the problem description.
