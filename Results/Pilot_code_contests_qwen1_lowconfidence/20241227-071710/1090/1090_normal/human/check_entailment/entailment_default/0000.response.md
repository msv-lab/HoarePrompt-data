Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. The code aims to calculate the number of ways to split the string into substrings that satisfy the conditions, the length of the longest substring, and the minimum number of substrings. However, it fails to achieve these objectives accurately due to several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Substring Counts**: The dynamic programming array `dp` is used to store the number of ways to split the string up to each position. However, the logic inside the nested loops does not correctly update `dp` values based on the constraints given by `arr`. Specifically, the current implementation does not properly account for the maximum allowed length of substrings for each character.

2. **Misinterpretation of Maximum Length Substring**: The variable `maxSubLen` is intended to track the maximum length of any substring, but the logic to update `maxSubLen` is flawed. The code incorrectly updates `maxSubLen` without considering the actual substring lengths and their validity according to `arr`.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Number of Substrings**: The variable `subNum` is intended to track the minimum number of substrings needed, but the logic to update `subNum` is not correct. The current implementation does not properly consider all valid ways to split the string into substrings that meet the constraints.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:

```
Input:
3
aab
2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

The expected output should be:

```
3
2
2
```

However, the provided code does not produce the correct output. The code fails to correctly handle the constraints for each character and does not properly compute the required values.

Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case.
