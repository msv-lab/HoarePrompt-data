You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mahmoud wrote a message s of length n. He wants to send it as a birthday present to his friend Moaz who likes strings. He wrote it on a magical paper but he was surprised because some characters disappeared while writing the string. That's because this magical paper doesn't allow character number i in the English alphabet to be written on it in a string of length more than ai. For example, if a1 = 2 he can't write character 'a' on this paper in a string of length 3 or more. String "aa" is allowed while string "aaa" is not.

Mahmoud decided to split the message into some non-empty substrings so that he can write every substring on an independent magical paper and fulfill the condition. The sum of their lengths should be n and they shouldn't overlap. For example, if a1 = 2 and he wants to send string "aaa", he can split it into "a" and "aa" and use 2 magical papers, or into "a", "a" and "a" and use 3 magical papers. He can't split it into "aa" and "aa" because the sum of their lengths is greater than n. He can split the message into single string if it fulfills the conditions.

A substring of string s is a string that consists of some consecutive characters from string s, strings "ab", "abc" and "b" are substrings of string "abc", while strings "acb" and "ac" are not. Any string is a substring of itself.

While Mahmoud was thinking of how to split the message, Ehab told him that there are many ways to split it. After that Mahmoud asked you three questions: 

  * How many ways are there to split the string into substrings such that every substring fulfills the condition of the magical paper, the sum of their lengths is n and they don't overlap? Compute the answer modulo 109 + 7. 
  * What is the maximum length of a substring that can appear in some valid splitting? 
  * What is the minimum number of substrings the message can be spit in? 



Two ways are considered different, if the sets of split positions differ. For example, splitting "aa|a" and "a|aa" are considered different splittings of message "aaa".

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 103) denoting the length of the message.

The second line contains the message s of length n that consists of lowercase English letters.

The third line contains 26 integers a1, a2, ..., a26 (1 ≤ ax ≤ 103) — the maximum lengths of substring each letter can appear in.

Output

Print three lines.

In the first line print the number of ways to split the message into substrings and fulfill the conditions mentioned in the problem modulo 109 + 7.

In the second line print the length of the longest substring over all the ways.

In the third line print the minimum number of substrings over all the ways.

Examples

Input

3
aab
2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1


Output

3
2
2


Input

10
abcdeabcde
5 5 5 5 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1


Output

401
4
3

Note

In the first example the three ways to split the message are: 

  * a|a|b
  * aa|b
  * a|ab



The longest substrings are "aa" and "ab" of length 2.

The minimum number of substrings is 2 in "a|ab" or "aa|b".

Notice that "aab" is not a possible splitting because the letter 'a' appears in a substring of length 3, while a1 = 2.
Program:
```
from __future__ import print_function

def func():
    n = input()
    str = raw_input()
    arr = raw_input().split()
    arr = map(eval, arr)
    MOD = 1000000000.0 + 7
    dp = [0] * 3200
    dp[0] = 1
    lastMatch = [0] * 3200
    for i in range(len(lastMatch)):
        lastMatch[i] = i
    maxSubLen = 0
    for i in range(1, len(str) + 1):
        j = 1
        k = arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]
        while j <= k and i - j >= 0:
            maxSubLen = max(j, maxSubLen)
            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD
            t = i - j - 1
            lastMatch[t + 1] = max(lastMatch[t + 1], i - 1)
            t = t if t > 0 else 0
            k = min(k, arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')])
            j += 1
    lastIndex = 0
    lastStrIndex = len(str) - 1
    subNum = 0
    while lastIndex != lastStrIndex:
        subNum += 1
        if lastIndex == lastMatch[lastIndex]:
            lastIndex += 1
        else:
            lastIndex = lastMatch[lastIndex]
    print(dp[len(str)], maxSubLen, subNum, sep='\n')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the constraints and logic required for the problem. Specifically, the logic for updating `lastMatch` and the way `dp` is computed do not accurately reflect the requirements.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3
aab
2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

- The string "aab" requires each character to fit within the constraints of the magical paper. Here, 'a' cannot appear in a substring of length 3, so the valid splits are "a|a|b", "aa|b", and "a|ab".
- The program should output:
  ```
  3
  2
  2
  ```

However, the provided program does not correctly compute these values. It seems to miscalculate the dynamic programming array `dp` and the logic for determining the maximum substring length and the minimum number of substrings.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly update the `dp` array based on the valid lengths for each character and properly track the maximum substring length and the minimum number of substrings needed.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
