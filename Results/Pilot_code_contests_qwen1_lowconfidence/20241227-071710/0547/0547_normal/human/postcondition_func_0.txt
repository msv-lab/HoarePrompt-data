The function processes a list of integers `nums` (representing skills) where each integer is between 0 and 100. It aims to make each element in the list a multiple of 10 by adding the smallest possible value to each element, up to a limit defined by the integer `k`. The function reads `n` and `k` from standard input, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then sorts the list in descending order based on the last digit of each integer. The function iterates through the list, attempting to increment each non-100 element to the nearest multiple of 10 within the remaining `k` capacity. If `k` is insufficient, the function stops. After processing, the function prints the sum of the integer divisions of each element by 10. If an `IOError` occurs during input, the function handles it silently. The final state of the program is that `n` and `k` retain their original values, `stop` is set to `True`, and `nums` contains elements that are multiples of 10 (unless they were originally 100), with `k` reduced accordingly.
