To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given Conditions:
- The loop continues as long as `stop` is `False`.
- The loop body updates `nums[i]` to `nums[i] + (10 - nums[i] % 10)` for all valid `i`.
- After the loop, `stop` is set to `True`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
while not stop:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- For the loop to continue, `stop` must be `False`.
- If `stop` is `True` after the previous iteration, it means the loop has already executed and updated `nums` and set `stop` to `True`.
- Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `stop` must be `False` at the start of the next iteration.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since `stop` is `False` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure `stop` is still `False` for the loop to proceed.
- No changes are required for `k` or `nums` because these variables are only updated inside the loop, and we don't know their exact values without seeing the loop body. However, they should remain in their current state (i.e., `k` remains the same and `nums` remains unchanged) for the loop to proceed.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `stop` to ensure it is `False` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final Answer:
State: **`stop` is `False`**
