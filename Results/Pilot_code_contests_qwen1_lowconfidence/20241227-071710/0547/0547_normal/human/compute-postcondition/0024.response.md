Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\); `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\); `stop` is `False`; `i` is 1; `delta` is \(10 - \text{last\_digit}\); `k` is updated to \(k - (10 - \text{last\_digit})\). Since the if condition `k == 0` is not met, none of the specific updates in the if or else part are executed, so the values of `n`, `k`, `stop`, `i`, `delta`, and `last_digit` remain unchanged.***
