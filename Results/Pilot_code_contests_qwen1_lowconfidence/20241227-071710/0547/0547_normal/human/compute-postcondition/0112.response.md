The code `break` is executed, which will exit the nearest loop or match statement. However, in this case, there is no loop or match statement active that would be affected by the `break` statement. The variables `stop`, `n`, and `i` are not modified by the `break` statement. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` is greater than `0`, `i` is `n-1`**
