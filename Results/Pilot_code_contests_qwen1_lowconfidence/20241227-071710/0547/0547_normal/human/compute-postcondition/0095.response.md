The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a nested structure, but in this case, it does not affect any variables. The values of the variables remain unchanged after executing the `break` statement.

Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `n` is greater than 0, `k` remains 0, `delta` is calculated as `10 - nums[i] % 10`. The current value of `k` is less than `delta` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
