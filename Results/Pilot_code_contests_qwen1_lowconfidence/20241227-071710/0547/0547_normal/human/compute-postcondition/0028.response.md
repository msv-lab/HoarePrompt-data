The code `break` does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Given the initial conditions, none of these variables are affected by this `break` statement. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\), `stop` is `False`, `i` is 1, `delta` is \(10 - \text{last\_digit}\) where `last_digit` is the last digit of `nums[1]`, `k` is updated to \(k - (10 - \text{last\_digit})\)**
