The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but indicates that we exit the current loop or block of code. The conditions and values of the variables before the `break` statement remain unchanged.

Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` must be greater than `0`, `k` is `k - delta`, `i` is `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or block of code.**
