The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the loop or conditional block it was inside is exited. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is specified, the only thing we know is that the `break` statement has been executed, which means we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `k` is `k - delta`, `stop` is `False`, `i` is 2, `delta` is `10 - nums[2] % 10`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
