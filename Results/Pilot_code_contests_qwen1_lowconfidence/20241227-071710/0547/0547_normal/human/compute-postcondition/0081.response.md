The code updates `nums[i]` by adding `delta` to its current value. The initial state includes that `k` is updated to `k - (10 - nums[i_new] % 10)`, `i_new` is less than `n`, `delta` is now `10 - nums[i] % 10`, and `nums[i_new]` is updated to `nums[i_new] + delta`. The value of `nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + delta`, but the value of `delta` remains the same since it is reassigned in the next line of code which is not included here. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is updated to `k - (10 - nums[i_new] % 10)`, `i_new` is less than `n`, `delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10`, and `nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + delta`.**
