The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code, the only impact is that the execution will break out of any enclosing loop or switch. However, since no such enclosing structure is mentioned in the initial state, we assume it's breaking out of a hypothetical context.

The states of the variables `stop`, `n`, `i`, and `delta` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` is greater than `0`, `i` is `n-1`, `delta` is `10 - (nums[i] % 10)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
