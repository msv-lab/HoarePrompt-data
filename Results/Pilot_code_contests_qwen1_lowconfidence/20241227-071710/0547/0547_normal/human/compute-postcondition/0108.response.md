The code `stop = False` assigns the value `False` to the variable `stop`. The value of `stop` was initially `False`, so it remains `False`. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` is greater than 0, and `k` is `- (10 - nums[i] % 10)`**
