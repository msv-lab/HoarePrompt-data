Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\), `nums` is a sorted list of integers based on the last digit of each number in descending order, `stop` is `True`, `i` is 0, and since the condition `k == 0` is true, the function does nothing and these conditions remain unchanged.***
