`n` is converted from a string to an integer using `int(n)`, and `k` is also converted from a string to an integer using `int(k)`. The initial preconditions that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5` and `0 ≤ k ≤ 10^7` still hold.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `k` is an integer between 0 and 10^7**
