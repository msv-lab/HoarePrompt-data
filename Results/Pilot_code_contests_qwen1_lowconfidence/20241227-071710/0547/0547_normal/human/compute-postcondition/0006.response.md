Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `not stop`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `stop` is `False`.

2. **Current State Before the Loop**: 
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\).
   - `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\).
   - `nums` is a sorted list of integers based on the last digit of each number in descending order.
   - `stop` is `False`.

3. **Determine What Needs to Change**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `stop` must be `False` initially, which it already is according to the given state.

Since `stop` is already `False`, no modification to the state is necessary to ensure the loop can execute at least one time. 

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\); `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\); `nums` is a sorted list of integers based on the last digit of each number in descending order; `stop` is `False`**
