The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables, nor does it affect the control flow in a way that would make any other variable's value different from its initial state or the last calculated state.

Given the initial state and the fact that `continue` does not modify any variable values, the output state remains the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` is greater than `0`, `i` is `n-1`**
