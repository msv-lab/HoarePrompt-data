According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. The initial states provided are:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\)
- `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\)
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers based on the last digit of each number in descending order
- `stop` is `True`

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `n` is at least 1. Since the problem states that `n` is between 1 and \(10^5\), `n` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to 1. However, for clarity and to match the format requested, we will include it in the final state.

Additionally, the value of `k` and the condition of `stop` being `True` are not directly relevant to the loop's execution but might affect the loop body. Therefore, we focus on ensuring the loop can start.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\), `nums` is a sorted list of integers based on the last digit of each number in descending order, `stop` is `True`, `i` is 0**
