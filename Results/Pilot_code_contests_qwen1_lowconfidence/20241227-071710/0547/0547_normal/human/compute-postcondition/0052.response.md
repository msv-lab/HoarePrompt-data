The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, in this case, no loop is present in the given code snippet. Therefore, the execution of `continue` does not change any variable values or the state of the program.

Output State: **`stop` is True, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is equal to 0, and the current value of `nums[i]` is 100**
