Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `k` is `k - delta`, `stop` is `False`, `i` is 2, `delta` is \(10 - \text{new_last_digit}\). If `nums[i]` equals 100, no changes occur to the variables.*** 

Since there is no `else` part, the postcondition remains unchanged if the condition `nums[i] == 100` is not met. Therefore, the overall postcondition simply reiterates the initial state of the variables as specified in the precondition.
