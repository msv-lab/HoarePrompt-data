The code snippet updates `nums[i]` by adding `delta` to `nums[i]`. Based on the initial conditions:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\).
- `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\).
- `stop` is `False`.
- `i` is 1.
- `delta` is \(10 - \text{last\_digit}\), where `last_digit` is the last digit of `nums[1]`.
- `k` is updated to \(k - (10 - \text{last_digit})\). If `k < delta`, then `k` is further updated to \(k - (10 - \text{last_digit})\). Otherwise, the values of `n`, `k`, `stop`, `i`, and `delta` remain unchanged.

After executing `nums[i] = nums[i] + delta`:

- `nums[i]` is updated by adding `delta` to its current value.
- Since the value of `nums[i]` changes, `delta` also changes because `delta` depends on `last_digit` which is part of `nums[i]`.

Therefore, the new value of `delta` is \(10 - \text{new\_last\_digit}\), where `new_last_digit` is the last digit of the new value of `nums[i]`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `stop`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\), `stop` is `False`, `i` is 1, `delta` is \(10 - \text{new\_last\_digit}\) where `new_last_digit` is the last digit of the updated `nums[i]`.**
