The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where both are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^7. Additionally, the function accepts a list `skills` which is a sequence of `n` integers `ai` where 0 ≤ ai ≤ 100.

Based on the given output cases, the function does not directly return a value but rather seems to process the input parameters and possibly the list `skills`. However, since no specific return values or conditions are provided in the output, we can only describe the parameters accepted.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept parameters `n` and `k` (both positive integers with specified ranges) and a list `skills` (a sequence of integers within a specified range).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^7, and a list `skills` which is a sequence of `n` integers `ai` where 0 ≤ ai ≤ 100.**
