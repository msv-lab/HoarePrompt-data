The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, in this case, there is no loop context provided in the initial state or the given code snippet. Since the `continue` statement does not modify any variables and only affects the flow of control within a loop, and no loop is specified, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\), `nums` is a sorted list of integers based on the last digit of each number in descending order, `stop` is `True`, `i` is 0, and since the condition `nums[i] == 100` is true, the current value of `i` is 1.**
