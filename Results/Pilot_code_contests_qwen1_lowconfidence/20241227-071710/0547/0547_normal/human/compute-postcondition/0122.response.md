Let's analyze the loop step by step and determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all possible iterations.

### Initial State:
- `stop` is `True`
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is an integer
- `nums` is a list of integers

### Loop Analysis:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if nums[i] == 100:
        continue
    delta = 10 - nums[i] % 10
    if k < delta:
        break
    stop = False
    nums[i] = nums[i] + delta
    k = k - delta
```

### Observations:
1. **Break Condition**: The loop breaks if `k` becomes zero or less.
2. **Continue Condition**: The loop skips the rest of the loop body if `nums[i]` is 100.
3. **Modification**: For each iteration, if `k` is greater than or equal to `delta`, `stop` is set to `False`, `nums[i]` is increased by `delta`, and `k` is decreased by `delta`.

### After the Loop Executes Some Number of Times:
- The loop continues until either `k` reaches zero or less, or all elements in `nums` that are not 100 have been processed.

### Final State Analysis:
- **Case 1: The loop does not execute**:
  - `stop` remains `True`.
  - `n` can be any non-negative integer.
  - `k` remains its original value.
  - `nums` remains unchanged.

- **Case 2: The loop executes**:
  - `stop` is `False`.
  - `n` is a positive integer.
  - `k` is updated to reflect the remaining value after processing the elements in `nums`.
  - `nums` contains elements that are modified according to the rules inside the loop, and no element is 100.
  - Each modified element `nums[i]` ends up being a multiple of 10.

### Conclusion:
- If the loop executes, it modifies the list `nums` such that each element becomes a multiple of 10, unless it was 100, in which case it is skipped.
- The final value of `k` is the initial value minus the cumulative `delta` applied to the elements in `nums`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is the initial value of `k` minus the sum of `delta` for all valid elements in `nums`, `nums` is a list where each element (except those that were 100) is now a multiple of 10.**
