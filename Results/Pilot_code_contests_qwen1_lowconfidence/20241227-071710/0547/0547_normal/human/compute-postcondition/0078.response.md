The `break` statement is executed, which does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no indication of which loop or conditional block this `break` is part of, we assume it is breaking out of the context in which these assignments were made.

Given the initial state:
- `stop` is `False`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `k` is updated to `k - (10 - nums[i_new] % 10)`
- `i_new` is less than `n`
- `delta` is now `10 - nums[i] % 10`
- `nums[i_new]` is updated to `nums[i_new] + delta`

Since the `break` statement does not alter any variable values and only exits the current context, the values of `stop`, `n`, `k`, `i_new`, `delta`, and `nums[i_new]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is updated to `k - (10 - nums[i_new] % 10)`, `i_new` is less than `n`, `delta` is now `10 - nums[i] % 10`, and `nums[i_new]` is updated to `nums[i_new] + delta`. We break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.**
