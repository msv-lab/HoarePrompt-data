Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\), `nums` is a sorted list of integers based on the last digit of each number in descending order, `stop` is `True`, `i` is either 1 (if `nums[0] == 100`) or remains 0 (if `nums[0] != 100), `delta` is \(10 - \text{last\_digit}\) where `last_digit` is the last digit of `nums[i]`, and `k` is lower than `delta`.**
