The code `break` is used to exit the loop or conditional statement it is within. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement that the `break` statement is part of, its execution does not change any variable values. The variables `stop`, `n`, and `k` remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `- (10 - nums[i] % 10)`**
