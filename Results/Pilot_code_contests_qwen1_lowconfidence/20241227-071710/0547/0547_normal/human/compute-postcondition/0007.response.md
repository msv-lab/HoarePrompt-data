The variable `stop` is set to `True`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\); `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\); `nums` is a sorted list of integers based on the last digit of each number in descending order; `stop` is `True`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\); `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\); `nums` is a sorted list of integers based on the last digit of each number in descending order; `stop` is `True`**
