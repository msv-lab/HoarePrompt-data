The code `nums = raw_input().split()` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `nums`. However, since the initial values of `n` and `k` are not dependent on the input, they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `nums` and retains the original values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `k` is an integer between 0 and 10^7, `nums` is a list of strings obtained from splitting a single line of input on whitespace**
