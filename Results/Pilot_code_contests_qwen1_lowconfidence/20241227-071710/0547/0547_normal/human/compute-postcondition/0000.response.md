`n, k = raw_input().split()` splits the input into two parts and assigns them to `n` and `k`. Since `raw_input()` returns a string, `n` and `k` will be strings after this operation. The original values of `n` and `k` as positive integers are lost, and now they are treated as strings. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is a string, `k` is a string, and the precondition that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^7 still holds.`**
