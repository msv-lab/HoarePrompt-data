The code `k = k - delta` subtracts the value of `delta` from `k`. Given that `delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10`, the value of `k` is updated accordingly. The other variables (`stop`, `n`, `i_new`, `nums`, etc.) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is updated to `k - (10 - nums[i_new] % 10)`, `i_new` is less than `n`, `delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10`, and `nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + delta`.**
