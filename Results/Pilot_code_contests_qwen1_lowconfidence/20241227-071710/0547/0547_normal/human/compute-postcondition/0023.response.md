The code `break` does not affect any variables and simply exits the current loop or conditional block. Since no loop or conditional block is specified in the provided code snippet, we assume this `break` statement is outside any such block. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\); `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\); `stop` is `False`; `i` is 1; `delta` is \(10 - \text{last\_digit}\); `k` is updated to \(k - (10 - \text{last\_digit})\).**
