The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block that is being executed, the `continue` statement does not change any variable values or affect the state of the program. The only condition mentioned is that if `k == 0`, no changes occur to the variables. Since the `continue` statement itself does not modify any variables and the condition for `k == 0` is not specified to trigger here, the variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `k` is `k - delta`, `stop` is `False`, `i` is 2, `delta` is \(10 - \text{new_last_digit}\)**
