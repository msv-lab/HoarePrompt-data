Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n`: Integer between 1 and \(10^5\).
- `k`: Integer between 0 and \(10^7\).
- `nums`: Sorted list of integers based on the last digit in descending order.
- `stop`: Initially `True`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`. For each iteration:
1. It checks if `k == 0`. If true, the loop breaks.
2. It skips the iteration if `nums[i] == 100`.
3. It calculates `delta` as `10 - (nums[i] % 10)`.
4. It checks if `k < delta`. If true, the loop breaks.
5. It sets `stop` to `False`.
6. It updates `nums[i]` to `nums[i] + delta`.
7. It updates `k` to `k - delta`.

### Key Observations:
- The loop modifies `nums` such that each element becomes a multiple of 10.
- The loop stops when `k` is exhausted (`k == 0`), or when it encounters `100` in `nums`.
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking due to `k == 0` or encountering `100`, all elements in `nums` will be multiples of 10, and `k` will be adjusted accordingly.

### Final State:
After the loop completes all its iterations:
- `n`: Remains the same as the initial value.
- `k`: Remains the same as the initial value, unless it was fully depleted during the loop.
- `stop`: Will be `False` if the loop completed all iterations without hitting the stopping conditions (`k == 0` or encountering `100`).
- `i`: Will be `n` (since the loop will iterate up to `n-1` and then exit).
- `delta`: No longer relevant as the loop ends.
- `nums`: All elements will be multiples of 10 because the loop ensures this condition.

### Output State:
- If the loop completes all iterations:
  - `n`: An integer between 1 and \(10^5\).
  - `k`: An integer between 0 and \(10^7\).
  - `stop`: `False`.
  - `i`: `n`.
  - `nums`: A list of integers where each element is a multiple of 10.
  
- If the loop breaks due to `k == 0` or encountering `100`:
  - `n`: An integer between 1 and \(10^5\).
  - `k`: An integer between 0 and `k` (where `k` is the remaining value when the loop exits).
  - `stop`: `True`.
  - `i`: The index of the element causing the loop to break.
  - `nums`: A list where elements are multiples of 10 up to the index `i`, and the rest may still have their original values depending on the breaking condition.

### Final Output State:
**Output State:**
- If the loop completes all iterations:
  - `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\); `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\); `stop` is `False`; `i` is `n`; `nums` is a list of integers where each element is a multiple of 10.
- If the loop breaks due to `k == 0` or encountering `100`:
  - `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\); `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\); `stop` is `True`; `i` is the index where the loop broke; `nums` is a list where elements are multiples of 10 up to the index `i`, and the rest may still have their original values.
