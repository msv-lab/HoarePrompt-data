Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\).
   - `k` is `k - delta`.
   - `stop` is `False`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `delta` is \(10 - \text{new_last_digit}\).

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(0, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs from `0` to `n-1` inclusive. Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 2.

4. **Adjusting Other States:**
   - The value of `k` is updated to `k - delta`.
   - `stop` remains `False` unless some condition within the loop changes it.
   - `delta` remains unchanged as it is derived from `new_last_digit` and does not change within the loop.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `i` will be 2.
- `k` will be `k - delta`.
- `stop` remains `False`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `delta` remains the same.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `k` is `k - delta`, `stop` is `False`, `i` is 2, `delta` is \(10 - \text{new_last_digit}\)**
