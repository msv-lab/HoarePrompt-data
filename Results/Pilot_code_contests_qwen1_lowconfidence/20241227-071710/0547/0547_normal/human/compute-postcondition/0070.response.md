`nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + delta`. The value of `delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10`, so `nums[i]` is incremented by `10 - nums[i] % 10`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` must be greater than `0`, `k` is updated to `k - (10 - nums[i] % 10)`, `i` is incremented by `1`, `delta` is set to `10 - nums[i] % 10`, and `nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + delta`.**
