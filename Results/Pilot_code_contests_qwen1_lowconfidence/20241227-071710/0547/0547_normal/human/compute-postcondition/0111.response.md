Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, the loop condition depends on both `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `stop` is `False`.
   - `n` is greater than `0`.
   - `k` is set to `- (10 - (nums[i] + delta) % 10) - delta`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n-1`. Since `i` was incremented in the previous iteration, it must now be `n-1`.
   - Given that `n` is greater than `0`, `i` being `n-1` ensures that the loop will run again if `i` is incremented to `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `stop` remains `False` as no condition within the loop would have changed this flag unless explicitly modified inside the loop body.
   - `n` must still be greater than `0` for the loop to continue.
   - `i` must now be `n-1` for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` is greater than `0`, `i` is `n-1`**
