Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The code is:
   ```python
   print(sum([(num / 10) for num in nums]))
   ```

2. This code calculates the sum of each element in `nums` divided by 10.

3. The value of `stop` is `True`. Since there is no code that changes the value of `stop`, it remains `True`.

4. The value of `k` is updated by subtracting the sum of `delta` for all elements in `nums` that are not equal to 100. However, this code does not change the value of `k` itself, only updates its definition.

5. Each element in `nums` (except those that were originally 100) is now a multiple of 10. The code divides each of these elements by 10, so the resulting values will be integers. 

Since the exact values of `nums` and `delta` are not specified, we can represent the updated `nums` as a list of multiples of 10 (excluding 100), and the division operation will simplify the numbers. However, the key point is that the sum of these values will be the new state of the list after division.

Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `k` is the original value of `k` minus the sum of `delta` for all elements in `nums` that are not equal to 100, and `nums` is a list where each element (except those that were originally 100) is now an integer obtained by dividing the original value by 10.**
