`nums[i]` is assigned the value of `nums[i] + delta`. From the initial state, `i` is 2, so `nums[2]` is updated by adding `delta` to its current value. The value of `delta` is `10 - nums[2] % 10`. After adding `delta` to `nums[2]`, the new value of `nums[2]` is `nums[2] + (10 - nums[2] % 10)`. The other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `k` is `k - delta`, `stop` is `False`, `i` is 2, `delta` is `10 - nums[2] % 10`, `nums[2]` is `nums[2] + (10 - nums[2] % 10)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `k` is `k - delta`, `stop` is `False`, `i` is 2, `delta` is `10 - nums[2] % 10`, `nums[2]` is `nums[2] + (10 - nums[2] % 10)`**
