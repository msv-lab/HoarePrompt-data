`stop` is assigned the value `False`, changing its state from `True` to `False`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged: `n` must be greater than `0`, `k` is `0`, and `delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10`. If the current value of `k` is less than `delta`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if the condition `k < delta` is not met.
