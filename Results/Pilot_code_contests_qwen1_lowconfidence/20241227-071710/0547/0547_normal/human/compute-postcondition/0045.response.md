According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `stop`. If `not stop` is true, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the state does not provide any information about the value of `stop`.

Since we need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `stop` must be `False`.

State: **`stop` is False**
