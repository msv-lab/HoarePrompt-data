The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block it is within. However, since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the only thing we can conclude is that the code simply breaks out of the current context. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` must be greater than `0`, `k` is `k - (10 - nums[i] % 10)`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
