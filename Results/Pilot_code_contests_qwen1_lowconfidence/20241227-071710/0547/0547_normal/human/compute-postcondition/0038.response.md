The code updates the value of `delta` to `10 - nums[i] % 10`. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `nums[i]`. Since `nums[i]` equals 100 results in no changes to the variables, let's consider the general case where `nums[i]` is not 100.

1. The initial state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `k` is `k - delta`, `stop` is `False`, `i` is 2, `delta` is \(10 - \text{new_last_digit}\).
2. The code sets `delta` to `10 - nums[i] % 10`.

Since the initial value of `delta` is defined as `10 - \text{new_last_digit}`, and the new value of `delta` is now `10 - nums[i] % 10`, the new value of `delta` will be `10 - nums[2] % 10`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `n` remains unchanged (an integer between 1 and \(10^5\)).
- `k` remains unchanged (`k - delta`).
- `stop` remains unchanged (`False`).
- `i` remains unchanged (`2`).
- `delta` is now `10 - nums[2] % 10`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `k` is `k - delta`, `stop` is `False`, `i` is 2, `delta` is `10 - nums[2] % 10`**
