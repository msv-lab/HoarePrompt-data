`k` is decremented by `delta`, which is `10 - nums[i] % 10`. The other variables (`stop`, `n`, `i`, `delta`, and `nums[i]`) remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` must be greater than `0`, `k` is updated to `k - (10 - nums[i] % 10)`, `i` is incremented by `1`, `delta` is set to `10 - nums[i] % 10`, and `nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + delta`**
