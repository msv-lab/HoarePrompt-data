The code `break` does not change any variable values but indicates the exit from the nearest loop or conditional statement. Since no loop or conditional statement is mentioned in the given code, the execution of `break` here does not alter the values of any variables. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\), `nums` is a sorted list of integers based on the last digit of each number in descending order, `stop` is `True`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `k` is 0.**
