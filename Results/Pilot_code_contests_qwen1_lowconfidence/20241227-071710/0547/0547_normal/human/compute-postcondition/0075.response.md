The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables outside the loop. Given the precondition and the fact that the `continue` statement does not alter any variable values, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is updated to `k - (10 - nums[i_new] % 10)`, `i_new` is less than `n`, `delta` is set to `10 - nums[i_new] % 10`, and `nums[i_new]` is updated to `nums[i_new] + delta`. If `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
