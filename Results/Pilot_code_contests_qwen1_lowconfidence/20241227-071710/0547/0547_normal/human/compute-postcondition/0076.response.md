Postcondition: ***`stop` is `False`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is updated to `k - (10 - nums[i_new] % 10)`, `i_new` is less than `n`, `delta` is set to `10 - nums[i_new] % 10`, and `nums[i_new]` is updated to `nums[i_new] + delta`. If `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since the else part is not provided, the postcondition remains unchanged from the if part.***
