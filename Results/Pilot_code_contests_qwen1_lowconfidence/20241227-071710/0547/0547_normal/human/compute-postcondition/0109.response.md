`nums[i]` is incremented by `delta`. The value of `delta` is not specified in the initial state, but it does not affect the conditions given. The value of `k` is defined as `- (10 - nums[i] % 10)`, but since `nums[i]` is updated, `k` will no longer hold its original value. However, the initial condition that `n` is greater than 0 and `stop` is `False` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` is greater than 0, and `k` is `- (10 - (nums[i] + delta) % 10)`**
