The code assigns the value of `10 - nums[i] % 10` to `delta`. This does not change the value of `delta` itself, which was previously set to `10 - nums[i_new] % 10`, but it updates the value of `delta` in the current scope. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is updated to `k - (10 - nums[i_new] % 10)`, `i_new` is less than `n`, `delta` is now `10 - nums[i] % 10`, and `nums[i_new]` is updated to `nums[i_new] + delta`.**
