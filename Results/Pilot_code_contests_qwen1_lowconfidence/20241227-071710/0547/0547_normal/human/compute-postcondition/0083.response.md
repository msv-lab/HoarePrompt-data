Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `stop` is `True`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is an integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if nums[i] == 100:
        continue
    delta = 10 - nums[i] % 10
    if k < delta:
        break
    stop = False
    nums[i] = nums[i] + delta
    k = k - delta
```

### Analysis:

1. **Break Conditions**:
   - The loop breaks if `k == 0`.
   - The loop also breaks if `k < delta` where `delta = 10 - nums[i] % 10`.

2. **Continue Condition**:
   - The loop continues if `nums[i] == 100`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the following operations occur:
     - `stop` is set to `False`.
     - `nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + delta`.
     - `k` is updated to `k - delta`.

### Final State Determination:

#### Case 1: The Loop Executes at Least Once
- After each iteration of the loop, `stop` becomes `False`.
- The value of `nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + delta`.
- `k` is updated to `k - delta`.
- The loop continues until either `k == 0` or `k < delta` for the current `i`, or it reaches the end of the list `nums`.

#### Case 2: The Loop Does Not Execute
- If the loop does not execute at all, `stop` remains `True`.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `nums` remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:

- If the loop executes at least once, `stop` is `False`.
- If the loop executes, `k` is reduced by the necessary `delta` values for each valid `i`.
- If the loop executes, `nums` is modified accordingly.

### Output State:
Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is the remaining value of `k` after all valid updates, `nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + (10 - nums[i] % 10)` for all valid `i`, `nums` is a list of integers.**

If the loop does not execute:
- `stop` is `True`.
- `k` remains the original value.
- `nums` remains the original list.

Thus, the comprehensive output state considering both scenarios is:

Output State: **`stop` is `False` and `k` is the remaining value of `k` after all valid updates, `nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + (10 - nums[i] % 10)` for all valid `i`, `nums` is a list of integers. Otherwise, `stop` is `True`, `k` remains the original value, and `nums` remains the original list.**
