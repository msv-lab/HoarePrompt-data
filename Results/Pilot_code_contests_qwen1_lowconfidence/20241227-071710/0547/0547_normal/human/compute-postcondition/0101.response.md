The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code snippet, the `break` statement effectively ends the execution of the current context, but it does not alter the values of `stop`, `n`, and `k`.

Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `-delta` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
