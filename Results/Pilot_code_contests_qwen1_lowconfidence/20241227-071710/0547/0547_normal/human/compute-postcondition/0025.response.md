The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables; it only continues to the next iteration of the loop if one is currently being executed. Since the initial values of the variables are provided and no changes are made by the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\); `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\); `stop` is `False`; `i` is 1; `delta` is \(10 - \text{last\_digit}\); `k` is updated to \(k - (10 - \text{last\_digit})\).**
