According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `stop` is `False`
- `n` must be greater than `0`
- `k` is updated to `k - (10 - nums[i] % 10)`
- `i` is incremented by `1`
- `delta` is set to `10 - nums[i] % 10`
- `nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + delta`

Since `i` is incremented by `1` at the end of the last iteration, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new = i + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i_new` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `i_new` should be less than `n`.

State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is updated to `k - (10 - nums[i_new] % 10)`, `i_new` is less than `n`, `delta` is set to `10 - nums[i_new] % 10`, and `nums[i_new]` is updated to `nums[i_new] + delta`**
