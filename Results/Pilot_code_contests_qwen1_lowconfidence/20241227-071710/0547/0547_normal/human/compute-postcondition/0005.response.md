The code `stop = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `stop`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, or the `nums` list. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `stop`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\); `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\); `nums` is a sorted list of integers based on the last digit of each number in descending order; `stop` is `False`**
