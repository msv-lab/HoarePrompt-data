The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since the initial state indicates that the program has entered an if condition with `nums[i]` being equal to 100, the `continue` statement will cause the loop to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.

The states of the other variables (`stop`, `n`, and `k`) are not affected by the `continue` statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `n` is greater than 0, the current value of `k` is 0, and the program skips to the next iteration of the loop.**
