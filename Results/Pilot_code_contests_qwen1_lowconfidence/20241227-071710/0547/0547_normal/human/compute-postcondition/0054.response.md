`delta` is assigned the value `10 - nums[i] % 10`. The value of `nums[i]` could be any value, but the operation `% 10` will give the last digit of `nums[i]`. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `nums[i]`, we can only express `delta` in terms of `nums[i]`.

The initial state includes:
- `stop` is `True`
- `n` must be greater than `0`
- `k` is `0`

Since the code does not affect `stop`, `n`, or `k`, and the exact value of `nums[i]` is not specified, the value of `delta` depends on the last digit of `nums[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `stop` is `True`, `n` must be greater than `0`, `k` is `0`, and `delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10`.

Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `n` must be greater than `0`, `k` is `0`, and `delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10`**
