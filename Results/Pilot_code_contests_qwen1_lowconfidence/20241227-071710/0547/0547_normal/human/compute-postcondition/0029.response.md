Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\), `stop` is `False`, `i` is 1, `delta` is \(10 - \text{last\_digit}\) where `last_digit` is the last digit of `nums[1]`, and `k` is updated to \(k - (10 - \text{last\_digit})\). If `k < delta`, then `k` is further updated to \(k - (10 - \text{last\_digit})\). Otherwise, the values of `n`, `k`, `stop`, `i`, and `delta` remain unchanged.***
