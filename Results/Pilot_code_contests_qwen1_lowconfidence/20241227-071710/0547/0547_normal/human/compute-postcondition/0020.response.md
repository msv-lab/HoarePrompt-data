The code `nums[i] = nums[i] + delta` increments the value of `nums[i]` by `delta`. 

- `n` and `k` remain unchanged since they are not directly involved in this operation.
- `i` could be 0 or 1 depending on whether `nums[0]` is 100 or not. This state does not change with the given code.
- `delta` is defined as \(10 - \text{last\_digit}\), where `last_digit` is the last digit of `nums[i]`.
- `nums[i]` is updated by adding `delta` to its current value.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we consider both cases:

1. If `nums[0] == 100`, then `i` is 1.
2. If `nums[0] != 100`, then `i` remains 0.

Let's denote the last digit of `nums[i]` as `last_digit`.

If `i` is 1:
- `nums[1]` is updated to `nums[1] + delta`.

If `i` is 0:
- `nums[0]` is updated to `nums[0] + delta`.

The output state is therefore:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\).
- `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\).
- `stop` is `False`.
- `i` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether `nums[0]` is 100.
- `delta` is \(10 - \text{last\_digit}\), where `last_digit` is the last digit of `nums[i]`.
- `nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + delta`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\); `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\); `stop` is `False`; `i` is either 0 or 1; `delta` is \(10 - \text{last\_digit}\); `nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + delta`**
