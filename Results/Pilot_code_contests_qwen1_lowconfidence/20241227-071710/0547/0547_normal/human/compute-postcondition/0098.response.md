The code snippet `nums[i] = nums[i] + delta` attempts to modify the `i`-th element in the `nums` list by adding the value of `delta` to it. However, there is no predefined `nums` list provided in the initial state, and no specific value for `i` or `delta` is given. Since the initial state does not include `nums` and `i`, and `delta` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact outcome. But we know that `stop` is `False`, `n` is greater than 0, and `k` remains 0.

Given the lack of specific details about `nums`, `i`, and `delta`, the only thing we can infer is that the operation attempted to modify `nums[i]`, but since no `nums` list is provided, the operation itself would not change anything and is essentially undefined in this context.

Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` is greater than 0, and `k` remains 0.**
