The code sorts the list `nums` using a custom comparator that sorts based on the last digit of each number in descending order. This means that for any two numbers `a` and `b` in `nums`, they are compared as follows: `b % 10 - a % 10`. Since `n` and `k` are not affected by this operation, their values remain unchanged. After sorting, the `nums` list is updated based on the new order.

Given that the initial state is:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\);
- `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\);
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from converting the original list of strings.

After executing the sort operation, the output state will be:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\);
- `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\);
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers based on the last digit of each number in descending order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\); `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\); `nums` is a sorted list of integers based on the last digit of each number in descending order.**
