The code calculates the difference between 10 and the last digit of `nums[i]`. Let's denote the last digit of `nums[i]` as `last_digit`.

1. `last_digit = nums[i] % 10`
2. `delta = 10 - last_digit`

Since the exact value of `nums[i]` is not given, let's express `delta` in terms of `last_digit`.

- If `nums[0] == 100`, then `i` is 1.
- If `nums[0] != 100`, then `i` is 0.

Let's consider both cases:

### Case 1: `nums[0] == 100`
- `i` is 1.
- The last digit of `nums[1]` is `last_digit`.
- `delta = 10 - last_digit`.

### Case 2: `nums[0] != 100`
- `i` is 0.
- The last digit of `nums[0]` is `last_digit`.
- `delta = 10 - last_digit`.

In both cases, the `stop` variable remains `True`, and `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\), `nums` is a sorted list of integers based on the last digit of each number in descending order, `stop` is `True`, `i` is either 1 (if `nums[0] == 100`) or remains 0 (if `nums[0] != 100), and `delta` is \(10 - \text{last\_digit}\) where `last_digit` is the last digit of `nums[i]`.**
