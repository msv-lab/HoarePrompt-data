The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the loop or control structure we are inside. However, the `break` statement does not modify any variable values; it only affects the flow of the program by exiting the current loop or block of code.

Given the initial state and the fact that no further operations are performed after the `break` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is updated to `k - (10 - nums[i_new] % 10)`, `i_new` is less than `n`, `delta` is set to `10 - nums[i_new] % 10`, and `nums[i_new]` is updated to `nums[i_new] + delta` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
