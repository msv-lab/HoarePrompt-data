The code subtracts `delta` from `k`. The initial value of `k` is given by the expression `- (10 - (nums[i] + delta) % 10)`. After subtracting `delta` from `k`, the new value of `k` becomes `- (10 - (nums[i] + delta) % 10) - delta`.

Therefore, the updated state of `k` is `- (10 - (nums[i] + delta) % 10) - delta`.

The states of the other variables (`stop`, `n`, `nums`, and `delta`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `- (10 - (nums[i] + delta) % 10) - delta`**
