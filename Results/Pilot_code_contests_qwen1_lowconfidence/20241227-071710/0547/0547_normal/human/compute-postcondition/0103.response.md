The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop context, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables and simply moves to the next line of code. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` is greater than 0, and `k` is `-delta`.**
