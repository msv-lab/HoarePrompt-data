The code `nums = [int(num) for num in nums]` iterates over each element in the `nums` list, converts each string element to an integer, and creates a new list with these integer values. The original `nums` list is updated with this new list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\).
- `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\).
- `nums` is a list of strings obtained from splitting a single line of input on whitespace.

After executing the code, `nums` will be a list of integers instead of strings. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\); `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\); `nums` is a list of integers obtained from converting the original list of strings.**
