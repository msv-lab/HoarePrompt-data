The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead exits the loop or conditional block it is within. Since there is no explicit loop or conditional block in the provided code snippet, the only effect is that the execution exits the current block. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `k` is `k - delta`, `stop` is `False`, `i` is 2, `delta` is \(10 - \text{new_last_digit}\)**
