The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, it does not affect the values of any variables outside of the loop. Therefore, the values of `stop`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` must be greater than `0`, `k` is `k - delta`, `i` is `i + 1`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
