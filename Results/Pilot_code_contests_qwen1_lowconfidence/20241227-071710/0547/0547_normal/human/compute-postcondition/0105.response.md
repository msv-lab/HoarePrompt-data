The code calculates `delta` as `10 - nums[i] % 10`. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `nums[i]`, only that it is not equal to 100. Since `nums[i] % 10` gives the last digit of `nums[i]`, and assuming `nums[i]` is not specifically known but follows the condition given, the value of `delta` depends on the last digit of `nums[i]`.

Given that `nums[i]` is not specifically 100, let's denote the last digit of `nums[i]` as `last_digit`. Therefore, `delta` is calculated as `10 - last_digit`.

The initial state is: `stop` is `False`, `n` is greater than 0, and `k` is `-delta`.

After the code runs, `delta` is updated, but `nums[i]` remains unchanged. Therefore, the new state for `k` is `-delta`.

Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `- (10 - nums[i] % 10)`**
