You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya loves computer games. Finally a game that he's been waiting for so long came out!

The main character of this game has n different skills, each of which is characterized by an integer ai from 0 to 100. The higher the number ai is, the higher is the i-th skill of the character. The total rating of the character is calculated as the sum of the values ​​of <image> for all i from 1 to n. The expression ⌊ x⌋ denotes the result of rounding the number x down to the nearest integer.

At the beginning of the game Petya got k improvement units as a bonus that he can use to increase the skills of his character and his total rating. One improvement unit can increase any skill of Petya's character by exactly one. For example, if a4 = 46, after using one imporvement unit to this skill, it becomes equal to 47. A hero's skill cannot rise higher more than 100. Thus, it is permissible that some of the units will remain unused.

Your task is to determine the optimal way of using the improvement units so as to maximize the overall rating of the character. It is not necessary to use all the improvement units.

Input

The first line of the input contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ k ≤ 107) — the number of skills of the character and the number of units of improvements at Petya's disposal.

The second line of the input contains a sequence of n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100), where ai characterizes the level of the i-th skill of the character.

Output

The first line of the output should contain a single non-negative integer — the maximum total rating of the character that Petya can get using k or less improvement units.

Examples

Input

2 4
7 9


Output

2


Input

3 8
17 15 19


Output

5


Input

2 2
99 100


Output

20

Note

In the first test case the optimal strategy is as follows. Petya has to improve the first skill to 10 by spending 3 improvement units, and the second skill to 10, by spending one improvement unit. Thus, Petya spends all his improvement units and the total rating of the character becomes equal to  lfloor frac{100}{10} rfloor + lfloor frac{100}{10} rfloor = 10 + 10 =  20.

In the second test the optimal strategy for Petya is to improve the first skill to 20 (by spending 3 improvement units) and to improve the third skill to 20 (in this case by spending 1 improvement units). Thus, Petya is left with 4 improvement units and he will be able to increase the second skill to 19 (which does not change the overall rating, so Petya does not necessarily have to do it). Therefore, the highest possible total rating in this example is <image>.

In the third test case the optimal strategy for Petya is to increase the first skill to 100 by spending 1 improvement unit. Thereafter, both skills of the character will be equal to 100, so Petya will not be able to spend the remaining improvement unit. So the answer is equal to <image>. 
Program:
```
def func():
    try:
        (n, k) = raw_input().split()
        (n, k) = (int(n), int(k))
        nums = raw_input().split()
        nums = [int(num) for num in nums]
        nums.sort(cmp=lambda a, b: b % 10 - a % 10)
        stop = False
        while not stop:
            stop = True
            for i in range(0, n):
                if k == 0:
                    break
                if nums[i] == 100:
                    continue
                delta = 10 - nums[i] % 10
                if k < delta:
                    break
                stop = False
                nums[i] = nums[i] + delta
                k = k - delta
        print(sum([num / 10 for num in nums]))
    except IOError:
        pass


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the total rating of the character. Specifically, the program sorts the skills in a way that does not guarantee the optimal distribution of improvement units. 

For example, consider the input:

```
3 8
17 15 19
```

The program sorts the skills as `[19, 17, 15]` and then tries to distribute the improvement units. However, the optimal strategy would be to improve the first skill to 20 (by spending 3 units) and the third skill to 20 (by spending 1 unit), leaving 4 units. These remaining 4 units can be used to improve the second skill to 19, which still results in a total rating of `5`. 

However, the program does not account for this optimal distribution and instead uses a sorting strategy that may not always lead to the maximum total rating. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes a list of integers `nums` (representing skills) where each integer is between 0 and 100. It aims to make each element in the list a multiple of 10 by adding the smallest possible value to each element, up to a limit defined by the integer `k`. The function reads `n` and `k` from standard input, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then sorts the list in descending order based on the last digit of each integer. The function iterates through the list, attempting to increment each non-100 element to the nearest multiple of 10 within the remaining `k` capacity. If `k` is insufficient, the function stops. After processing, the function prints the sum of the integer divisions of each element by 10. If an `IOError` occurs during input, the function handles it silently. The final state of the program is that `n` and `k` retain their original values, `stop` is set to `True`, and `nums` contains elements that are multiples of 10 (unless they were originally 100), with `k` reduced accordingly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
