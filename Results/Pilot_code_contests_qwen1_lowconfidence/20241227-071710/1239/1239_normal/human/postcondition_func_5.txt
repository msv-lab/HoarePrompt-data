The function `func_6` sets up a high recursion limit and stack size to handle potentially large numbers of test cases. It then starts a new thread to execute the `main` function, which processes `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b`, and the function returns a result based on these values for each test case. However, the function does not specify what exactly the `main` function does with `a` and `b`. Therefore, the exact nature of the result returned is unknown. Additionally, the function does not handle potential exceptions that might occur during the execution of the thread.
