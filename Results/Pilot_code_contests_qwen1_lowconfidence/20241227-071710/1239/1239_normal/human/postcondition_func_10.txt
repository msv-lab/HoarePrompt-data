The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and returns a binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix. The function achieves this by first converting the integer `n` to its binary form using the `bin()` function, which includes the '0b' prefix. It then removes the '0b' prefix using the `replace()` method. The function correctly handles all integers within the specified range, including edge cases such as the smallest (`1`) and largest (`10^9`) possible values. No missing functionality or edge cases were found in the provided code.
