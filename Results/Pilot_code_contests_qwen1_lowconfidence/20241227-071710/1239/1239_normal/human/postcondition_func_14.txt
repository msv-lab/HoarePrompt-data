The function `func_15` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `p` are integers, and `y` is a non-negative integer representing the exponent. The function calculates \( x^{2^k} \mod p \) using the square-and-multiply algorithm and stores the result in `res`. The variable `res` is initialized to 1 and updated in each iteration of the loop. After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `res`, which is always 1. This is because the initial value of `res` is set to 1, and no operations modify its value during the loop.
