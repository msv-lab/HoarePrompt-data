The function `func_4()` accepts no explicit parameters. It reads input from the standard input stream, expecting a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two space-separated integers \(a\) and \(b\). The function processes this input and returns a map object containing strings of these integers. The map object will have \(t\) entries, where \(t\) is the number of test cases, and each entry will consist of two string representations of integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted according to the specified constraints. However, it does not handle potential input errors or edge cases such as invalid input formats or values outside the specified range.
