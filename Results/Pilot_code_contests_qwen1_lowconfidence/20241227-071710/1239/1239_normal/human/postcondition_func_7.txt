The function `func_8` accepts a single parameter `l`, which is expected to be a list containing exactly two integers `[a, b]`. It returns a new list where these integers are sorted in descending order based on the key determined by the `getKey` function. If `getKey` is not defined or does not return valid keys, the default behavior of the `sorted` function (which sorts based on the natural ordering of the elements) will be used. Potential edge cases include `l` being an empty list or `l` not containing exactly two elements, in which case the function will raise a `ValueError`.
