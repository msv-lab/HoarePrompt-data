The function `func_16` accepts two positive integers `x` and `y` such that \(1 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\). It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. After executing the algorithm, the function returns 0. This is because the last value of `y` (which is the GCD of `x` and `y`) is assigned to `x`, and then `x` is returned, which is 0. Therefore, the final state of the program after the function concludes is that the return value is 0, regardless of the initial values of `x` and `y` (as long as they are within the specified range).
