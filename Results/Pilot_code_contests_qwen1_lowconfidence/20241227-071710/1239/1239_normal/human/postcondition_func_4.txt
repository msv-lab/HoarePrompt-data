The function `func_5()` does not accept any parameters and returns a list. This list is generated by calling the function `func_3()` for each test case, where each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b`. Since `func_3()` is not defined in the provided code snippet, the contents of the list returned by `func_5()` are unspecified. The function assumes that `func_3()` processes the integers `a` and `b` from each test case and returns a value (which could be a single value or a list) for each test case. If `func_3()` fails to process a test case or encounters an error, the behavior is undefined because no error handling is mentioned.
