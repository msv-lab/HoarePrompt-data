The function `func_20()` does not actually return any value; instead, it writes elements of `args` to the specified `file` (defaulting to `sys.stdout`) separated by a separator (`sep`). After writing, it appends an `end` character and flushes the buffer if specified. The function iterates over the elements of `args` and writes them to the file, updating the `at_start` flag to ensure separators are only added between elements. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, it flushes the write buffers. There are no conditions involving `a` and `b`, and the function does not return `t` as stated in the annotations. Instead, it simply outputs the elements of `args` with the specified formatting.
