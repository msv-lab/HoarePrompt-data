`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. Since `sep` is assigned to `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` has had `str(sep)` written to it before this line of code. Now, `x` is being written to `file`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `sep` remain unchanged, and `at_start` remains `False`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` has had `str(sep)` and `str(x)` written to it, `at_start` is `False`.**
