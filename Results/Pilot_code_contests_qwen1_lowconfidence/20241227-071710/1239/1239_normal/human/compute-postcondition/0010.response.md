The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file `file`. Since `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, the value of `sep` will be written to the file, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` has had `str(sep)` written to it, `at_start` is `False`**
