The code `ans += 1 << i` updates the value of `ans` by adding `1 << i` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and the condition `(x & 1 << i and y & 1 << i or (not x & 1 << i and (not y & 1 << i)))` is false. This condition simplifies to checking if `(x & 1 and y & 1 or (not x & 1 and (not y & 1)))`, which means both `x` and `y` should be odd or both should be even for the condition to be true. Since the condition is false, `x` and `y` cannot both be odd or both be even.

Let's assume the following (since we don't know the exact values of `x` and `y` from the condition):
- If `x` is odd and `y` is even, or vice versa, the condition would be false.

Given the condition is false, let's proceed with updating `ans`:

```python
ans += 1 << i
```

Since `i` is initially 0, `1 << i` is `1 << 0`, which equals 1. So, `ans` is updated to `ans + 1`.

Output State: **`ans` is 1, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()` and `func_1()` respectively, `i` is 1, and the condition `(x & 1 << i and y & 1 << i or (not x & 1 << i and (not y & 1 << i)))` is false.**
