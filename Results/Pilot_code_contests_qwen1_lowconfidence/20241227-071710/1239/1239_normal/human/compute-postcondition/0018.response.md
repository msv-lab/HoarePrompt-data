`at_start` is assigned the value `False`. This changes the value of `at_start`, but does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `sep`, `args`, or `file`. The value of `file` remains unchanged as it was set before the assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` must contain at least one more element, `file` is `str(sep) + str(a) + str(x)`**
