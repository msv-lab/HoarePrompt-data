Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the result of writing each element of `args` to `file` separated by `sep`, `at_start` is `False`**, and `args` must be an empty list if the loop did not execute.

### Explanation:
- **Initial Values**: The initial values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `sep`, and `file` are as provided in the initial state.
- **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in `args`. For each iteration, if `at_start` is `False`, it writes `sep` to `file`. It then writes `str(x)` to `file` and sets `at_start` to `False`.
- **Final State**:
  - After all iterations, `at_start` will always be `False` because the loop sets it to `False` in every iteration.
  - `file` will contain the concatenation of `str(x)` for each `x` in `args`, separated by `sep`.
  - If the loop executes, `args` must contain at least one element. If the loop does not execute, `args` will be an empty list.

Thus, the final state of the program after the loop completes (or does not complete) is described as above.
