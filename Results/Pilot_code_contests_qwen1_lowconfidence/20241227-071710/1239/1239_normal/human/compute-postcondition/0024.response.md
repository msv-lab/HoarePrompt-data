The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the definition `def func_20():`. Since there are no parameters mentioned, we need to focus on the outputs and constraints provided.

Based on the given constraints and output cases, the function likely processes some internal data or performs a calculation involving the integer `t` within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). However, without explicit parameters, we can only describe the expected behavior regarding the return value.

Given the output cases:
- Case_1: The function returns the integer `t`.
- Case_2: The function returns a string indicating a specific condition related to `a` and `b`.

Since there are no input parameters specified, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function returns the integer `t` if no specific conditions involving `a` and `b` are met; otherwise, it returns a string indicating a specific condition.**
