Output State: **`ans` is the sum of \(1 << i\) for all positions where the \(i\)-th bit of `x` and `y` differ, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `func_1()` returns the same value as the previous iteration; `x` and `y` are the new values returned by `func_3()`**.

Explanation:
- The line `x, y = func_3()` calls the function `func_3()` and assigns its return values to `x` and `y`.
- The initial state specifies that `ans` is calculated based on the bits of `x` and `y`.
- After this line of code, `x` and `y` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
- The value of `ans` remains unchanged from the initial state's definition because the calculation of `ans` depends on the bits of `x` and `y`, and these values are only updated here.
- `func_1()` still returns the same value as the previous iteration, as specified in the initial state.
