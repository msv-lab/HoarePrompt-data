The code `ans += 1 << i` increments `ans` by `2^i`. Given the conditions:

- `x & 1 << i` is False or `y & 1 << i` is True
- `x & 1 << i` is True or `y & 1 << i` is False

This means one of `x` or `y` must have the `i`-th bit set, and the other must not. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `x` and `y`, we only know that the `i`-th bit of one of them is 1 and the other is 0.

Let's assume without loss of generality that `x` has the `i`-th bit set and `y` does not (the analysis would be similar if the roles were reversed). This means `x & 1 << i` is True and `y & 1 << i` is False. Therefore, `1 << i` will be added to `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is 0
- `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`
- `y` is the value returned by `func_3()`
- `i` must be less than 32

After executing `ans += 1 << i`, `ans` will be `1 << i`.

Output State: **`ans` is 1 << i, `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`, `y` is the value returned by `func_3()`, `i` is less than 32**
