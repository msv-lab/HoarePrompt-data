Output State: **`ans` is the bitwise OR of all positions where both `x` and `y` have a 1, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `func_1()` returns the same value as the previous iteration, and `i` is 32.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each bit position from 0 to 31.
- For each bit position `i`, the loop checks if the `i-th` bit is set in both `x` and `y` or if the `i-th` bit is not set in both `x` and `y`.
- If the condition `(x & 1 << i and y & 1 << i) or (not x & 1 << i and not y & 1 << i)` is true, it means that the `i-th` bit is either set in both `x` and `y` or not set in both `x` and `y`.
- In such cases, the `i-th` bit is added to `ans` using the operation `ans += 1 << i`.

Since the loop runs from 0 to 31, it will check all bit positions. After the loop completes, `ans` will contain the bitwise OR of all positions where both `x` and `y` have a 1.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `x` and `y` do not share any bits set), `ans` will remain 0.
