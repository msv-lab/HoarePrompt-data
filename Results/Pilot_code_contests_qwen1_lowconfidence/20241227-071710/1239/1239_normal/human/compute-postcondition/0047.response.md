Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `ans` is 0
- `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`
- `func_1()` returns the same value as the previous iteration
- `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than 32
- The condition \((x & 1 << i) \text{ and } (y & 1 << i) \text{ or } (\text{not } (x & 1 << i) \text{ and } \text{not } (y & 1 << i))\) is satisfied

### Analysis
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration and must be less than 32, we know that `i` is currently equal to 31 (since it needs to check the next bit).
- The condition \((x & 1 << i) \text{ and } (y & 1 << i) \text{ or } (\text{not } (x & 1 << i) \text{ and } \text{not } (y & 1 << i))\) is true for `i = 31`.

### Next Iteration
- For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than 32. Since `i` was incremented from 30 to 31, it needs to be reset to 1 for the next iteration.
- The condition for the next iteration should be checked with `i = 1`.

### Updated States
- `ans` remains 0 since the condition was satisfied in the previous iteration.
- `x` and `y` remain the same as they were not modified in the loop body.
- `i` is reset to 1.
- The condition for the next iteration is \((x & 1 << 1) \text{ and } (y & 1 << 1) \text{ or } (\text{not } (x & 1 << 1) \text{ and } \text{not } (y & 1 << 1))\).

### Final Answer
State: **`ans` is 0, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `i` is 1, and the condition is \((x & 1 << 1) \text{ and } (y & 1 << 1) \text{ or } (\text{not } (x & 1 << 1) \text{ and } \text{not } (y & 1 << 1))\)**
