The variable `at_start` is explicitly set to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, `at_start` is `False`, and `file` has had `str(x)` written to it.**
