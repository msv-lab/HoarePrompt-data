The code `continue` is used inside a loop structure to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not specify which loop it belongs to, so we assume it is part of a loop that was already in the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is either 0 or 2 depending on the condition `(x & 1 << 1) and (y & 1 << 1) or (not (x & 1 << 1) and not (y & 1 << 1))`
- `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`
- `i` is 2

Since the `continue` statement does not change any variables and simply skips to the next iteration of the loop, the values of `ans`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`ans` is either 0 or 2 depending on the condition `(x & 1 << 1) and (y & 1 << 1) or (not (x & 1 << 1) and not (y & 1 << 1)), `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `i` is 2**
