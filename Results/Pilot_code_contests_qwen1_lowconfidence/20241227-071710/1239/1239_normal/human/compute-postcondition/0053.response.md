First, let's analyze the initial state:
- `ans` is either 0 or 2 depending on the condition `(x & 1 << 1) and (y & 1 << 1) or (not (x & 1 << 1) and not (y & 1 << 1))`
- `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`
- `i` is 2

The code to be executed is:
```python
ans += 1 << i
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The expression `1 << i` shifts the number 1 left by `i` positions. Since `i` is 2, this results in `1 << 2` which equals 4.
2. The `+=` operator updates the value of `ans` by adding 4 to its current value.

Now, we need to consider the two possible initial values of `ans`:

**Case 1: `ans` is 0**
- If `ans` is 0, then `ans += 4` will result in `ans` becoming 4.

**Case 2: `ans` is 2**
- If `ans` is 2, then `ans += 4` will result in `ans` becoming 6.

Since the exact value of `ans` depends on the condition, the final value of `ans` will be either 4 or 6 based on the condition. The values of `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`ans` is either 4 or 6; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`; `y` is the value returned by `func_3()`; `i` is 2.**
