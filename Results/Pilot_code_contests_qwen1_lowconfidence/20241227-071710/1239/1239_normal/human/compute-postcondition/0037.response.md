The code `func_20(ans)` is called with the argument `ans`. The value of `ans` is determined by the initial state where `ans` is the sum of `1 << i` for all positions where the i-th bit of `x` and `y` differ, and `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`.

Since the function calls `func_20(ans)` and no other operations are performed on `ans` or any other variables within the provided code snippet, the value of `ans` remains unchanged after the function call.

Therefore, the Output State is the same as the initial state, with `ans` being the sum of `1 << i` for all positions where the i-th bit of `x` and `y` differ, and `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`.

Output State: **`ans` is the sum of `1 << i` for all positions where the i-th bit of `x` and `y` differ, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`**
