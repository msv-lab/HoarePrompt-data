The function `func_19` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it obtains `x` and `y` from a function call `func_3()`. Both `x` and `y` are integers, and they satisfy the constraint \(1 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\). 

The possible outputs are not explicitly defined in the problem statement, but since no specific return values are mentioned beyond the input acquisition, we can infer that the function's primary purpose is to prepare these values for further processing.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but obtains integers `x` and `y` from `func_3()` where \(1 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\) and does not return any value explicitly based on the given information.**
