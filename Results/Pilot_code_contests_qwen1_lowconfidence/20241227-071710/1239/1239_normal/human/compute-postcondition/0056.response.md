The function `func_20(ans)` is called, which means `ans` will be passed as an argument to `func_20`. However, the exact behavior of `func_20` is not specified, so we cannot determine what changes will be made to `ans` within this function call. The values of `x` and `y` are determined by `func_3()`, but no changes are made to them in this code snippet. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Since no specific changes are made to `ans` within the provided code snippet, the value of `ans` is passed to `func_20` but no new value is assigned to `ans` inside the snippet. Therefore, the output state remains as:

Output State: **`ans` is the bitwise OR of all positions where both `x` and `y` have a 1, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `func_1()` returns the same value as the previous iteration, and `i` is 32.**
