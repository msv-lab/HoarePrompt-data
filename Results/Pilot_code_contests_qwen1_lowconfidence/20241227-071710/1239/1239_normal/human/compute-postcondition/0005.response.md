`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file specified by `file`. The value of `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, which means it could be ' ' (default space) if no 'sep' was provided in `kwargs`, or whatever value was provided for 'sep' in `kwargs`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `at_start`, and `args`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` must contain at least one element; the file has had `sep` written to it.**
