The code `ans += 1 << i` increments `ans` by `1 << i`. Given that `i` is 32, this line of code is equivalent to `ans += 1 << 32`.

In binary, `1 << 32` is a 1 followed by 32 zeros, which is `2^32` in decimal. Since `ans` is initially an integer where its value depends on the conditions given, adding `2^32` (a very large number) to `ans` will result in `ans` being `2^32`.

The conditions for `ans` are:
- If both the i-th bits of `x` and `y` are set or both are not set, `ans` remains 0.
- Otherwise, `ans` is set to `1 << i`.

Since `i` is 32, and we are adding `1 << 32` to `ans`, regardless of the initial state of `ans` based on the conditions provided, after executing the code, `ans` will be `2^32`.

Output State: **`ans` is 2^32, `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`, `y` is the value returned by `func_3()`, and `i` is 32**
