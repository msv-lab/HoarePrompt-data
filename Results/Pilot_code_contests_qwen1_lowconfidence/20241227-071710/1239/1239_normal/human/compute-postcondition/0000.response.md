The provided code snippet is a comment and does not perform any action that would change the values of the variables. Therefore, the only variables that have values from the initial state are `t`, `a`, and `b`. The comment does not affect these values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^{9}, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^{9}.**
