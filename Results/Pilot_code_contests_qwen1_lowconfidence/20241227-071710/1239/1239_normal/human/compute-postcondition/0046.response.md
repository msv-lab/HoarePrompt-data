Postcondition: ***`ans` is 0, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `func_1()` returns the same value as the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than 32, and the condition `(x & 1 << i and y & 1 << i or (not x & 1 << i and (not y & 1 << i)))` is satisfied. Otherwise, `ans` is 1, `i` is reset to 1, and the condition is false.***
