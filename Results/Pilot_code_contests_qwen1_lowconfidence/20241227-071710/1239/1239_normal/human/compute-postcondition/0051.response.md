Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `ans` is either 0 or 2 depending on the condition `(x & 1 << 1) and (y & 1 << 1) or (not (x & 1 << 1) and not (y & 1 << 1))`.
   - `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i` in `range(32)`, meaning `i` will take values from 0 to 31.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value `i` will take is 2.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `ans`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are made to these variables within the loop.

5. **New State:**
   - `i` changes from 1 to 2.
   - `ans`, `x`, and `y` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the new state before the next iteration is:

**State: **`ans` is either 0 or 2 depending on the condition `(x & 1 << 1) and (y & 1 << 1) or (not (x & 1 << 1) and not (y & 1 << 1)), `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `i` is 2**.
