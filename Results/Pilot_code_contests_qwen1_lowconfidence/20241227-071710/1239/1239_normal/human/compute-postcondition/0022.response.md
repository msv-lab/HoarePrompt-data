The code `file.flush()` is called, which flushes the write buffers for the file object `file`. This does not change the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `sep`, `at_start`, or `flush`, but it confirms that the buffer is flushed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the result of writing each element of `args` to `file` followed by `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, `at_start` is `False`, `flush` is `True`, and the write buffers for `file` have been flushed.**
