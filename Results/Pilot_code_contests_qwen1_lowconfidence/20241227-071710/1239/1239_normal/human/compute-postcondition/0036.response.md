Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations have executed.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 31, checking the i-th bit of `x` and `y`. If the i-th bit of both `x` and `y` is set (`1`) or both are not set (`0`), `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `1 << i`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `ans` is 0
- `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`
- `y` is the value returned by `func_3()`

### Key Observations
1. **Bitwise Check**: For each iteration, the loop checks the i-th bit of `x` and `y`.
   - If both bits are `1` or both are `0`, `ans` remains `0`.
   - If one bit is `1` and the other is `0`, `ans` is set to `1 << i`.

2. **Final State**:
   - After 32 iterations, the loop will have checked all 32 bits.
   - `ans` will accumulate the sum of `1 << i` for those positions where the i-th bit of `x` and `y` differ.

### Final Output State
After the loop completes all 32 iterations, `ans` will contain the sum of `1 << i` for all positions where the i-th bit of `x` and `y` differ.

Thus, the final output state is:
- `ans` is the sum of `1 << i` for all positions where the i-th bit of `x` and `y` differ.
- `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`.

### Formatted Output State
Output State: **`ans` is the sum of `1 << i` for all positions where the i-th bit of `x` and `y` differ, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`.**
