First, let's analyze the initial conditions and the given code snippet.

Initial State:
- `ans` is 0
- `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`
- `i` is 1
- The condition \((x & 1 << 1) \text{ and } (y & 1 << 1) \text{ or } (\text{not } (x & 1 << 1) \text{ and } \text{not } (y & 1 << 1))\) is true

Now, let's look at the code snippet:

```python
ans += 1 << i
```

This line of code updates the value of `ans` by adding \(1 << i\) to its current value. Since `i` is 1, \(1 << 1\) equals 2. So, `ans` is updated by adding 2 to its current value.

Since `ans` was initially 0, after the operation, `ans` will be \(0 + 2 = 2\).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`ans` is 2, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `i` is 1, and the condition \((x & 1 << 1) \text{ and } (y & 1 << 1) \text{ or } (\text{not } (x & 1 << 1) \text{ and } \text{not } (y & 1 << 1))\) is true.**
