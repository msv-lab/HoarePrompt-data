Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Understanding**: 
   - The initial state given is that `ans` is an integer.
   - The condition for setting `ans` is based on the i-th bit of `x` and `y` returned by `func_3()`:
     - If both the i-th bits of `x` and `y` are set or both are not set, then `ans` remains 0.
     - Otherwise, `ans` is set to \(1 \ll i\).
     - If none of the above conditions are met, `ans` is set to \(2^{32}\).
   - The value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is 32.

2. **For Loop Context**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = 31`.
   - The loop will execute again if `i < 32`.

3. **Next Iteration State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 32.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than 32.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to 0 for the next iteration.

4. **Function Call and Bitwise Conditions**:
   - `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
   - The condition for setting `ans` based on the i-th bits of `x` and `y` needs to be considered for `i = 0`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` is set to 0 for the next iteration, we need to consider the bitwise conditions for `i = 0`.
   - `ans` will remain 0 if both the 0-th bits of `x` and `y` are set or both are not set.
   - Otherwise, `ans` will be set to \(1 \ll 0 = 1\).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 0.
- `ans` is 0 (since both the 0-th bits of `x` and `y` being set or not set will result in `ans` remaining 0).

**Final State:**
State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 0**
