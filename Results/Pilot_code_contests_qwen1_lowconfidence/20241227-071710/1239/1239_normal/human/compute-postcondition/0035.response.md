Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are integers. `ans` is either unchanged or set to `A + (1 << I)`, and `i` is set to `I`. Specifically, if `x & 1 << i` and `y & 1 << i` are both true, or if both `x & 1 << i` and `y & 1 << i` are false, then `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `A + (1 << I)` and `i` is set to `I`.***
