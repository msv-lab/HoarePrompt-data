The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the loop will continue to its next iteration.

Given the initial conditions and the presence of the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `i` is 1, and the condition is \((x & 1 << 1) \text{ and } (y & 1 << 1) \text{ or } (\text{not } (x & 1 << 1) \text{ and } \text{not } (y & 1 << 1))\). The loop will continue to its next iteration.**
