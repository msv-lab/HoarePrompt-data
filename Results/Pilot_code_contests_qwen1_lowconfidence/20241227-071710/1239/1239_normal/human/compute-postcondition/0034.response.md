The code `ans += 1 << i` updates the value of `ans` by adding `1` shifted left by `i` positions. However, the initial values of `ans` and `i` are not specified in the initial state. Let's denote the initial value of `ans` as `A` and the initial value of `i` as `I`.

- `ans` is updated by adding `1` shifted left by `I` positions to its current value `A`.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged.

So, the new value of `ans` is `A + (1 << I)`.

Output State: **`ans` is `A + (1 << I)`, `i` is `I`**
