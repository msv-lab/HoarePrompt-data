Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the result of writing each element of `args` to `file` followed by `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, `at_start` is `False`, the value of `flush` is popped from `kwargs` and is `True`**
