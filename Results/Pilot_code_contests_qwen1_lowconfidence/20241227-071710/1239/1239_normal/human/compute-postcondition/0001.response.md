The code `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` is removing the 'sep' and 'file' keys from the `kwargs` dictionary and assigning default values if they do not exist. The `sep` variable is assigned the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, which means if 'sep' is in `kwargs`, its value is taken, otherwise, it defaults to a space `' '`. Similarly, the `file` variable is assigned the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, which means if 'file' is in `kwargs`, its value is taken, otherwise, it defaults to `sys.stdout`.

Since the initial state does not provide any specific values for `kwargs`, the exact values of `sep` and `file` cannot be determined. However, we know their default assignments.

The output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^{9}, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^{9}; `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` (defaulting to ' '), `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` (defaulting to `sys.stdout`).**
