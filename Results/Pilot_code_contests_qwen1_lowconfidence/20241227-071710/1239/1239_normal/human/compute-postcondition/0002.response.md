The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `sep`, or `file`. Therefore, the output state includes all the original conditions plus the new assignment to `at_start`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9; `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` (defaulting to ' '), `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` (defaulting to `sys.stdout`); `at_start` is True.**
