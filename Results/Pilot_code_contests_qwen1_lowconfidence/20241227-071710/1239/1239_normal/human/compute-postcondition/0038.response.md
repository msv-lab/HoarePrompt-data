To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop control variable and the function calls involved.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Control Variable (`_`)**:
   - The loop runs `func_1()` times.
   - We need to determine the value of `func_1()` at the end of the previous iteration.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The value of `func_1()` is not explicitly given, but it returns an integer.
   - Let's denote the return value of `func_1()` as `k`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, if the loop has just completed its `k-1`th execution, then for the next iteration, `func_1()` would still return the same value `k`.

3. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans` is the sum of \(1 << i\) for all positions where the \(i\)-th bit of `x` and `y` differ.
   - `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop counter `_` increments by 1 with each iteration, the loop will run one more time if `func_1()` returns the same value `k` (meaning the loop counter would now be `k`).
   - Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the condition where `func_1()` is called again, and the loop counter is incremented.

### Conclusion:

Given the loop runs `func_1()` times, and assuming `func_1()` returns the same value `k` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_1()` must still return `k`.

### Final State:

State: **`ans` is the sum of \(1 << i\) for all positions where the \(i\)-th bit of `x` and `y` differ, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `func_1()` must return the same value as the previous iteration.**

This can be expressed as:

State: **`ans` is the sum of \(1 << i\) for all positions where the \(i\)-th bit of `x` and `y` differ, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `func_1()` must return the same value as the previous iteration.**
