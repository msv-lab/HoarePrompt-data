The code initializes `ans` to 0. This means that `ans` is reassigned to 0, effectively resetting its value. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged from their previous values, and the precondition that `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()` and that `func_1()` returns the same value as the previous iteration still holds.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `func_1()` returns the same value as the previous iteration.**
