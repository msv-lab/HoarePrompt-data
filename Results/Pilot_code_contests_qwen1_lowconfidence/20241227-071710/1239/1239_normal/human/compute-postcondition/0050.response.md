Postcondition: ***`ans` is either 0 or 2 depending on the condition `(x & 1 << 1) and (y & 1 << 1) or (not (x & 1 << 1) and not (y & 1 << 1))`. If the condition is true, `ans` is set to 2; otherwise, `ans` remains 0. `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `i` is 1.***

This postcondition summarizes the possible states of `ans` after the if-else block based on the given condition. If the condition evaluates to true, `ans` is set to 2; otherwise, it remains 0. The values of `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the if-else block.
