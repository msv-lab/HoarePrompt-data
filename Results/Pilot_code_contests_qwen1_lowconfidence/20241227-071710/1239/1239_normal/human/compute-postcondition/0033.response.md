The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, in this case, there is no loop context provided, and the `continue` statement itself does not modify any variables. Therefore, the variables from the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **State remains unchanged**
