According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n` (which is not explicitly mentioned but implied by the range function). The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 32. 

Here are the steps to determine the necessary adjustments:

1. **Initial Values**: 
   - `ans` is initially 0.
   - `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
   - `func_1()` returns the same value as the previous iteration.

2. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will execute if `i < 32`.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `i` starts at 0 and the condition `i < 32` is true at the start of the loop.

State: **`ans` is 0, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `func_1()` returns the same value as the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `i` must be less than 32**.
