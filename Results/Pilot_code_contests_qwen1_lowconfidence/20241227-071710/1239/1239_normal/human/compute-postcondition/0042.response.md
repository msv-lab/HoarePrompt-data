Postcondition: ***`ans` is 0, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `func_1()` returns the same value as the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `i` must be less than 32, the current value of `(x & 1 << i)` and `(y & 1 << i)` satisfies the condition `(x & 1 << i and y & 1 << i or (not x & 1 << i and (not y & 1 << i)))`***
