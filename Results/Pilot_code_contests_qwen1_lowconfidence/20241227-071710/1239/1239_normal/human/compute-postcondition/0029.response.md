The `continue` statement in the given code does not affect the values of the variables `ans`, `x`, `y`, or `i`. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop (if there is one) and moves on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables and the loop condition and variables' states remain unchanged, the only information that needs to be included in the output state is the precondition itself.

Output State: **`ans` is an integer, if both the i-th bits of `x` and `y` are set or both are not set, then `ans` remains 0. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1 << i. `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `i` is 32.**
