The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, the loop is implied by the condition `(x & 1 << i) and (y & 1 << i) or (not x & 1 << i and not y & 1 << i)`, which checks the bits of `x` and `y` starting from the least significant bit (bit 0) up to bit 5 (since `i` must be less than 32).

Since `continue` is executed, the loop will skip to the next iteration, incrementing `i` by 1. The other variables (`ans`, `x`, `y`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`ans` is 0, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `func_1()` returns the same value as the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1` and it must be less than 32, the current value of `(x & 1 << i)` and `(y & 1 << i)` satisfies the condition `(x & 1 << i and y & 1 << i or (not x & 1 << i and (not y & 1 << i)))`**
