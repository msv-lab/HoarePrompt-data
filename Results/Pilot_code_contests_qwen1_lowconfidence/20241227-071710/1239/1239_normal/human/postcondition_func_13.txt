The function `func_14` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= y <= x. It returns the integer division of `x` by `y` if `x` is divisible by `y`. If `x` is not divisible by `y`, it returns `x // y + 1`. This ensures that the returned value is always greater than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `y`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where `x` is exactly divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`), returning `x // y`.
- The function correctly handles the case where `x` is not divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y != 0`), returning `x // y + 1`.
- The function ensures that the inputs are positive integers and that `1 <= y <= x`, as these conditions are checked by the nature of the input constraints.
