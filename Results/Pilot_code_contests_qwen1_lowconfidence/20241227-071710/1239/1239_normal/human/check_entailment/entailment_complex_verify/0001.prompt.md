You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In order to celebrate Twice's 5th anniversary, Tzuyu and Sana decided to play a game.

Tzuyu gave Sana two integers a and b and a really important quest.

In order to complete the quest, Sana has to output the smallest possible value of (a ⊕ x) + (b ⊕ x) for any given x, where ⊕ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR). 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}). Description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{9}).

Output

For each testcase, output the smallest possible value of the given expression.

Example

Input


6
6 12
4 9
59 832
28 14
4925 2912
1 1


Output


10
13
891
18
6237
0

Note

For the first test case Sana can choose x=4 and the value will be (6 ⊕ 4) + (12 ⊕ 4) = 2 + 8 = 10. It can be shown that this is the smallest possible value.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic to find the smallest possible value of \((a \oplus x) + (b \oplus x)\) for any given \(x\). Instead, it seems to be implementing a different algorithm that involves bitwise operations but does not correctly solve the given problem.

To solve the given problem, we need to recognize that the minimum value of \((a \oplus x) + (b \oplus x)\) is achieved when \(x\) is set such that the bits of \(a\) and \(b\) that differ contribute minimally to the sum. Specifically, the optimal \(x\) is the bitwise AND of the bitwise NOT of \(a\) and \(b\), i.e., \(x = (\sim a) \& b\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def main():
    t = func_1()
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = func_3()
        x = ((~a) & b)
        result = (a ^ x) + (b ^ x)
        func_20(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version correctly computes the minimum value of \((a \oplus x) + (b \oplus x)\) by setting \(x\) to \((\sim a) \& b\) and then computing the required expression.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{9}.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input from the user, which is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` prompts the user to input an integer value within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. After receiving the input, the function converts the input into an integer and returns it. There are no additional actions or postconditions beyond returning the integer input. This means that the function ensures the input is within the specified range, and it handles the input correctly by converting it to an integer and returning it. However, if the user inputs a value outside the range or a non-integer value, the function will raise a `ValueError`. No other postconditions or actions are performed by this function.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no direct relationship or variable information provided in the `func_2` function signature related to the problem description. The function does not take any parameters and presumably reads input from the user, which is not detailed within the function itself.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns a value entered by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and prompts the user to enter a value. It then returns the value entered by the user. This function is essentially a simple input mechanism. Potential edge cases include the user entering an empty string, in which case the function would still return an empty string. However, there is no functionality to handle non-string inputs or any error checking, such as ensuring the input is within a certain range or type.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables a and b are explicitly defined or passed as parameters in the provided function. However, it can be inferred that the function is part of a larger program where a and b are predefined integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{9}.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from a space-separated string input, where the input is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` reads a single line of input from the standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the input into a list of substrings based on spaces, and then converts each substring into an integer, returning a list of these integers. This function accepts no explicit parameters and relies on the standard input for its operation. The function handles the case where the input might contain multiple space-separated integers. If the input is empty or consists only of whitespace, the function will return an empty list. If the input contains non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two space-separated integers a and b, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object containing strings of two integers a and b from the input, where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9 and the number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` accepts no explicit parameters. It reads input from the standard input stream, expecting a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two space-separated integers \(a\) and \(b\). The function processes this input and returns a map object containing strings of these integers. The map object will have \(t\) entries, where \(t\) is the number of test cases, and each entry will consist of two string representations of integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted according to the specified constraints. However, it does not handle potential input errors or edge cases such as invalid input formats or values outside the specified range.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no direct information about variables in the function signature since the function does not take any parameters. However, based on the problem description, the function should handle multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers a and b.
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list generated by calling func_3() where the contents of the list are unspecified due to the absence of a definition for func_3() in the provided code snippet
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5()` does not accept any parameters and returns a list. This list is generated by calling the function `func_3()` for each test case, where each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b`. Since `func_3()` is not defined in the provided code snippet, the contents of the list returned by `func_5()` are unspecified. The function assumes that `func_3()` processes the integers `a` and `b` from each test case and returns a value (which could be a single value or a list) for each test case. If `func_3()` fails to process a test case or encounters an error, the behavior is undefined because no error handling is mentioned.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{9}.
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` sets up a high recursion limit and stack size to handle potentially large numbers of test cases. It then starts a new thread to execute the `main` function, which processes `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b`, and the function returns a result based on these values for each test case. However, the function does not specify what exactly the `main` function does with `a` and `b`. Therefore, the exact nature of the result returned is unknown. Additionally, the function does not handle potential exceptions that might occur during the execution of the thread.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: item is a tuple or list containing exactly two integers, where the second element is the value used to compare and sort items.
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
    #The program returns the second integer from the tuple or list 'item'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `item`, which is expected to be a tuple or list containing exactly two integers. It returns the second integer from `item`. The function performs no additional operations beyond returning the specified element. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code accurately reflects the intended behavior described. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the second integer from the input `item` is returned.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a sorted list of [a, b] in descending order, using the function getKey as the sorting key
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a single parameter `l`, which is expected to be a list containing exactly two integers `[a, b]`. It returns a new list where these integers are sorted in descending order based on the key determined by the `getKey` function. If `getKey` is not defined or does not return valid keys, the default behavior of the `sorted` function (which sorts based on the natural ordering of the elements) will be used. Potential edge cases include `l` being an empty list or `l` not containing exactly two elements, in which case the function will raise a `ValueError`.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of the resulting 2D list, and num is an integer that will be used to fill the entire 2D list.
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #The program returns a 2D list filled with the integer 'num', with dimensions 'n' rows and 'm' columns
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the resulting 2D list, and `num` is an integer that will be used to fill the entire 2D list. The function returns a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, where every element in the list is set to the integer `num`. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code; the function correctly creates and returns the specified 2D list.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer.
def func_10(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns True if x is 0, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns `True` if `x` is 0, otherwise it returns `False`. The function uses the expression `return x and not x & x - 1` to determine the return value. This expression checks if `x` is 0 by leveraging the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `x - 1`. If `x` is 0, then `x & x - 1` results in 0, and the expression evaluates to `True`. If `x` is any positive integer, `x & x - 1` will result in a non-zero value, making the expression evaluate to `False`. There are no edge cases or missing functionality as the provided code correctly implements the intended logic.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns a binary string representation of integer n without the '0b' prefix
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and returns a binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix. The function achieves this by first converting the integer `n` to its binary form using the `bin()` function, which includes the '0b' prefix. It then removes the '0b' prefix using the `replace()` method. The function correctly handles all integers within the specified range, including edge cases such as the smallest (`1`) and largest (`10^9`) possible values. No missing functionality or edge cases were found in the provided code.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is a digit from the original integer `n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and returns a list of its individual digits as integers. The function converts the integer `n` into a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string, converts each character back into an integer, and collects these integers into a list. This process ensures that all digits of `n` are included in the returned list. The function handles the edge case where `n` is a single-digit number by correctly returning a list containing only that digit. No other edge cases are explicitly addressed in the provided code, but the logic inherently manages the conversion and list creation for any valid input within the specified range.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= n.
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))
    #`The program returns the factorial of n divided by the product of the factorial of r and the factorial of the maximum value between n - r and 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r` such that \(0 \leq r \leq n\). It calculates and returns the binomial coefficient, which is the number of ways to choose `r` elements from a set of `n` elements without regard to the order of selection. This is mathematically represented as \(\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\). If `n - r` is 0, then `max(n - r, 1)` returns 1, ensuring the denominator is not zero. If `r` is 0 or `n`, the function correctly returns 1, as \(\binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n} = 1\). If `r > n`, the function would raise an error because of the initial condition check, but since the function's preconditions ensure \(0 \leq r \leq n\), this case is handled.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers such that 1 <= y <= x.
def func_14(x, y):
    if (x % y == 0) :
        return x // y
        #`The program returns the integer division of x by y, where x % y is 0`
    else :
        return x // y + 1
        #`The program returns x // y + 1, where x is a positive integer not divisible by y, and 1 <= y <= x`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= y <= x. It returns the integer division of `x` by `y` if `x` is divisible by `y`. If `x` is not divisible by `y`, it returns `x // y + 1`. This ensures that the returned value is always greater than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `y`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where `x` is exactly divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`), returning `x // y`.
- The function correctly handles the case where `x` is not divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y != 0`), returning `x // y + 1`.
- The function ensures that the inputs are positive integers and that `1 <= y <= x`, as these conditions are checked by the nature of the input constraints.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the base, y is an integer representing the exponent, and p is a positive integer representing the modulus. However, the provided function does not relate to the problem described in the problem statement. The problem requires finding the smallest possible value of (a ⊕ x) + (b ⊕ x) for a given x, where ⊕ is the bitwise XOR operation.
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `res` is 1, `x` is \( x^{2^k} \mod p \), `y` is 0, and `p` remains unchanged.
    return res
    #The program returns res which is 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `p` are integers, and `y` is a non-negative integer representing the exponent. The function calculates \( x^{2^k} \mod p \) using the square-and-multiply algorithm and stores the result in `res`. The variable `res` is initialized to 1 and updated in each iteration of the loop. After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `res`, which is always 1. This is because the initial value of `res` is set to 1, and no operations modify its value during the loop.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9.
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is 0, `y` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`
    return x
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` accepts two positive integers `x` and `y` such that \(1 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\). It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. After executing the algorithm, the function returns 0. This is because the last value of `y` (which is the GCD of `x` and `y`) is assigned to `x`, and then `x` is returned, which is 0. Therefore, the final state of the program after the function concludes is that the return value is 0, regardless of the initial values of `x` and `y` (as long as they are within the specified range).

#Function 17:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1.
def func_17(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is an integer greater than 1
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1, and `n` is greater than 3
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1 and greater than 3, and n is not divisible by 2 and n is not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is the smallest value such that `(5 + 6k)^2 > n`, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and greater than 3, and `n` is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3, and satisfies `(n % 5 != 0 and n % 7 != 0)`
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_17` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and determines whether `n` is a prime number. It returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise. The function checks several conditions to determine primality:

- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`.
- If `n` is less than or equal to 3, it returns `True`.
- If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, it returns `False`.
- For numbers greater than 3, it checks divisibility by numbers of the form \(5 + 6k\) and \(7 + 6k\) up to the square root of `n`.

The function returns `True` if `n` passes all these checks, indicating that `n` is a prime number. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

#Function 18:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}. For each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{9}.
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function changes the standard input and output streams to read from 'input.txt' and write to 'output.txt'. There are no parameters accepted by the function, and it does not return anything. This means that any subsequent input operations will read from 'input.txt' and any subsequent output operations will write to 'output.txt'. The function also does not process or manipulate any data; it only redirects the input and output streams.

#Function 19:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers obtained from a function call func_3(), and both x and y satisfy 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^{9}.
def func_19():
    for _ in range(func_1()):
        x, y = func_3()
        
        ans = 0
        
        for i in range(32):
            if x & 1 << i and y & 1 << i or not x & 1 << i and not y & 1 << i:
                continue
            else:
                ans += 1 << i
        
        func_20(ans)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` and `y` are the last values returned by `func_3()`, and `ans` is the bitwise OR of all positions where both `x` and `y` have a 1 bit set across all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_19()` accepts no parameters directly but obtains two integers `x` and `y` from the function `func_3()`. It then iterates through 32 bits (from 0 to 31) and checks if both `x` and `y` have a 1 bit set at the same position or if both have a 0 bit set at the same position. If either condition is met, it skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, it sets the corresponding bit in `ans`. After completing the loop, it calls `func_20()` with `ans` as its argument. The final state of the program after `func_19()` concludes is that `x` and `y` are the last values returned by `func_3()`, and `ans` is the bitwise OR of all positions where both `x` and `y` have a 1 bit set across all iterations. Potential edge cases include when both `x` and `y` have no bits set to 1 in common, in which case `ans` would be 0. Additionally, if `func_3()` returns `x` or `y` with all bits set to 1, `ans` would also be all bits set to 1.

#Function 20:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{9}.
def func_20():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the result of writing each element of `args` to `file` separated by `sep`, `at_start` is `False`
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the result of writing each element of `args` to `file` followed by `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, `at_start` is `False`, and if `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, the write buffers for `file` have been flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_20()` does not actually return any value; instead, it writes elements of `args` to the specified `file` (defaulting to `sys.stdout`) separated by a separator (`sep`). After writing, it appends an `end` character and flushes the buffer if specified. The function iterates over the elements of `args` and writes them to the file, updating the `at_start` flag to ensure separators are only added between elements. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, it flushes the write buffers. There are no conditions involving `a` and `b`, and the function does not return `t` as stated in the annotations. Instead, it simply outputs the elements of `args` with the specified formatting.
