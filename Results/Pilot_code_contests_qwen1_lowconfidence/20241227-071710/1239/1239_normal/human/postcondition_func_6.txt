The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `item`, which is expected to be a tuple or list containing exactly two integers. It returns the second integer from `item`. The function performs no additional operations beyond returning the specified element. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code accurately reflects the intended behavior described. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the second integer from the input `item` is returned.
