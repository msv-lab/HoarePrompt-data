The function `func_12` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and returns a list of its individual digits as integers. The function converts the integer `n` into a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string, converts each character back into an integer, and collects these integers into a list. This process ensures that all digits of `n` are included in the returned list. The function handles the edge case where `n` is a single-digit number by correctly returning a list containing only that digit. No other edge cases are explicitly addressed in the provided code, but the logic inherently manages the conversion and list creation for any valid input within the specified range.
