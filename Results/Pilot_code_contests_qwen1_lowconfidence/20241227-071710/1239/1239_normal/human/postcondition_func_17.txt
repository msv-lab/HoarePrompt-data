The function changes the standard input and output streams to read from 'input.txt' and write to 'output.txt'. There are no parameters accepted by the function, and it does not return anything. This means that any subsequent input operations will read from 'input.txt' and any subsequent output operations will write to 'output.txt'. The function also does not process or manipulate any data; it only redirects the input and output streams.
