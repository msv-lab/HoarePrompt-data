The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and prompts the user to enter a value. It then returns the value entered by the user. This function is essentially a simple input mechanism. Potential edge cases include the user entering an empty string, in which case the function would still return an empty string. However, there is no functionality to handle non-string inputs or any error checking, such as ensuring the input is within a certain range or type.
