The function `func_10` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns `True` if `x` is 0, otherwise it returns `False`. The function uses the expression `return x and not x & x - 1` to determine the return value. This expression checks if `x` is 0 by leveraging the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `x - 1`. If `x` is 0, then `x & x - 1` results in 0, and the expression evaluates to `True`. If `x` is any positive integer, `x & x - 1` will result in a non-zero value, making the expression evaluate to `False`. There are no edge cases or missing functionality as the provided code correctly implements the intended logic.
