The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r` such that \(0 \leq r \leq n\). It calculates and returns the binomial coefficient, which is the number of ways to choose `r` elements from a set of `n` elements without regard to the order of selection. This is mathematically represented as \(\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\). If `n - r` is 0, then `max(n - r, 1)` returns 1, ensuring the denominator is not zero. If `r` is 0 or `n`, the function correctly returns 1, as \(\binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n} = 1\). If `r > n`, the function would raise an error because of the initial condition check, but since the function's preconditions ensure \(0 \leq r \leq n\), this case is handled.
