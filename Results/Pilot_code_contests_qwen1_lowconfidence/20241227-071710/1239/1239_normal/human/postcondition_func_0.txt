The function `func_1` prompts the user to input an integer value within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. After receiving the input, the function converts the input into an integer and returns it. There are no additional actions or postconditions beyond returning the integer input. This means that the function ensures the input is within the specified range, and it handles the input correctly by converting it to an integer and returning it. However, if the user inputs a value outside the range or a non-integer value, the function will raise a `ValueError`. No other postconditions or actions are performed by this function.
