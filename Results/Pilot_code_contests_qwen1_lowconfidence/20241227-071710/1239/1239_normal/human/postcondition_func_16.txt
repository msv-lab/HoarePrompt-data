The function `func_17` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and determines whether `n` is a prime number. It returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise. The function checks several conditions to determine primality:

- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`.
- If `n` is less than or equal to 3, it returns `True`.
- If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, it returns `False`.
- For numbers greater than 3, it checks divisibility by numbers of the form \(5 + 6k\) and \(7 + 6k\) up to the square root of `n`.

The function returns `True` if `n` passes all these checks, indicating that `n` is a prime number. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
