The code `ans += 4 * cur` updates the value of `ans` by adding `4 * cur` to its current value. Given that `cur` is 4, `4 * cur` equals 16. Therefore, `ans` will be updated to `ans + 16`. The initial value of `ans` is 40, so the new value of `ans` will be `40 + 16`, which is 56. The values of the other variables (`i`, `cur`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `cur` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 12, `ans` is 56**
