`cur` is incremented by 1, and the value of `ans` remains as `ans + 4 * cur` because the expression was given in the initial state and was not re-evaluated or modified by the code. The Output State is: `ans` is `ans + 4 * (cur + 1)`, `cur` is `cur + 1`.

Output State: **`ans` is `ans + 4 * (cur + 1)`, `cur` is `cur + 1`**
