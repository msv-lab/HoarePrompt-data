The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. The initial state shows that `ans` is calculated as `ans + 8 * (cur + 1)` and `cur` is `cur + 2`. Given these conditions, the initial value of `cur` before the increment is 3 (since it was set to `cur + 2` in the initial state). After the increment, the value of `cur` becomes 4.

Since the value of `ans` was initially calculated based on `cur + 2`, and now `cur` is 4, the value of `ans` remains unchanged because the code does not reassign `ans`. Therefore, the value of `ans` stays as it was initially calculated.

Output State: **`ans` is `ans + 8 * 5`, `cur` is 4**
