Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `cur` is the original value of `i` + the number of iterations
   - `n` must satisfy `i * cur <= n`
   - `ans` is 4 * `cur` * (number of iterations - 1) + 20

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 2 to `n + 1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, so `i` will be 4.

4. **Adjusting `cur`:**
   - `cur` is defined as the original value of `i` plus the number of iterations.
   - Since `i` was 3, the original value of `i` is 3.
   - We need to determine the current number of iterations. From the previous state, we know that `i` was incremented once, so the number of iterations is 1.
   - Therefore, `cur` remains the same as it was before the increment of `i`.

5. **Adjusting `n`:**
   - `n` must satisfy `i * cur <= n`.
   - Since `i` is now 4 and `cur` is still 3, the condition becomes `4 * 3 <= n`, or `12 <= n`.
   - This means `n` must be at least 12 for the loop to continue.

6. **Adjusting `ans`:**
   - `ans` is calculated as `4 * cur * (number of iterations - 1) + 20`.
   - The number of iterations is 1, so `(number of iterations - 1)` is 0.
   - Therefore, `ans` remains `20`.

7. **Final State:**
   - `i` is 4
   - `cur` is still 3
   - `n` must be at least 12
   - `ans` is 20

State: **`i` is 4, `cur` is 3, `n` must be at least 12, `ans` is 20**
