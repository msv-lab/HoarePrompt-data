Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i * cur <= n`.

2. **Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `cur` is 3
   - `n` must satisfy `8 < n`
   - `ans` is 28

3. **Determine if the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, the condition `i * cur <= n` must be true.
   - Substituting the current values, we get `3 * 3 <= n`, which simplifies to `9 <= n`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `9 <= n` is required for the loop to execute again, and given that `8 < n` was already satisfied, we need to ensure that `n` satisfies `9 <= n`.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 9.

5. **Other States**:
   - `i` is 3 and `cur` is 3, and since the loop body is omitted, these values do not change unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not specified here.
   - `ans` is 28, and without knowing what happens in the loop body, we cannot assume it changes in this iteration.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop condition is met for the next iteration.

State: **`i` is 3, `cur` is 3, `n` must satisfy `9 <= n`, `ans` is 28**
