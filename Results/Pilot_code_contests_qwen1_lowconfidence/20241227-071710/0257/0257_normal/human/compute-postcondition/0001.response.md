The code defines a lambda function `rstrs` which reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each element to a string. However, the function itself does not assign or modify any variables; it only defines the function. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000**
