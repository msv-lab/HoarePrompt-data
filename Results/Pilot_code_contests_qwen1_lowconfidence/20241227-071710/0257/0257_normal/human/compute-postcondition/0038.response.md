The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is 2, so the new value of `cur` is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 4, `cur` is 3, `n` must be at least 12, `ans` is 28.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `cur` is 3, `n` must be at least 12, `ans` is 28**
