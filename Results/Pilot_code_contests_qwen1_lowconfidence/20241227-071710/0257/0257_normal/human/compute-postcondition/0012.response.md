Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i * cur <= n`.

2. **Current values**: 
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2
   - `cur` is 2

3. **Evaluate the current condition**: 
   - The current value of `i * cur` is `2 * 2 = 4`.
   - The current condition `i * cur <= n` becomes `4 <= n`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustment**: 
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `4 <= n` must be true.
   - Given that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 4 for the loop to start.

5. **Final state**: 
   - `i` remains 2
   - `n` must be at least 4 (since it must satisfy `4 <= n`)
   - `cur` remains 2

Therefore, the state right before the loop, adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 4, `cur` is 2**
