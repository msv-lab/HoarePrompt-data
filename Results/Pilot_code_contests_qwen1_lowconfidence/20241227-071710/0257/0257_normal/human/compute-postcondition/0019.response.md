First, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `ans` is `ans + 4 * (cur + 1)`
- `cur` is `cur + 1`

Code Snippet:
```
ans += 4 * cur
```

Now, let's think step by step:

1. In the initial state, `ans` is `ans + 4 * (cur + 1)`.
2. `cur` is `cur + 1`.

This means that before the code snippet is executed, `ans` is set to its current value plus four times `(cur + 1)` and `cur` is incremented by 1.

When we execute the line `ans += 4 * cur`, we are adding `4 * cur` to the current value of `ans`. Since `cur` was incremented by 1 in the previous step, we know `cur` is now one more than its original value.

Let's denote the original value of `cur` as `c`. So, after the first line of the initial state, `cur` becomes `c + 1`.

Therefore, in the second line, `ans` is updated as follows:
- The original value of `ans` is `ans + 4 * (c + 1)`.
- Now, `ans` is updated to `ans + 4 * (c + 1) + 4 * (c + 1) = ans + 8 * (c + 1)`.

So, the new value of `ans` is `ans + 8 * (c + 1)`, and the value of `cur` is `c + 2`.

Output State: **`ans` is `ans + 8 * (cur + 1)`, `cur` is `cur + 2`**
