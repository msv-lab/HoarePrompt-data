Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the smallest integer such that `(cur - 1) * i > n`, `n` must satisfy this condition, `ans` is `2 * cur * (cur - 1)`**.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` starts from 2.
   - `cur` starts from 2.
   - `ans` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i * cur <= n`.
   - For each iteration, `ans` is updated by adding `4 * cur`.

3. **Behavior Analysis**:
   - After each iteration, `cur` increases by 1.
   - The loop terminates when `i * cur` becomes greater than `n`.

4. **Final Values**:
   - When the loop terminates, `i` will be `n` because the loop increments `i` until the condition `i * cur > n` is met.
   - `cur` will be the smallest integer such that `(cur - 1) * i > n`. This ensures that the next increment of `cur` would make `i * cur > n`.
   - `ans` will be the cumulative sum of `4 * cur` for all valid `cur` values, which simplifies to `2 * cur * (cur - 1)`.

5. **Non-execution Case**:
   - If `n` is less than 4, the loop will not execute at all, and the values will remain as initially set:
     - `i` is 2.
     - `cur` is 2.
     - `ans` is 0.

Thus, the final state of the loop after all iterations is captured as described above.
