Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States
- `'i'` is 2.
- `'cur'` is \( 2 + k \), where \( k \) is the number of iterations such that \( 4 + 2k < n \).
- `'n'` must satisfy \( 4 + 2k < n \).
- `'ans'` is \( 2k(k + 3) \).

### Loop Condition
The for loop condition is `for i in range(2, n + 1)`.

### Analysis
1. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
2. **Condition for Next Iteration**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. Therefore, the next value of `i` should be 3 (since it starts from 2 and increments by 1 each time).
3. **Adjusting `cur` and `k`**: Since `cur` is defined based on the number of iterations (`k`), and we know `k` is such that \( 4 + 2k < n \), we need to find the new value of `k` after the next iteration. After the first iteration (where `i` was 2), `k` would be 1 because \( 4 + 2 \cdot 1 = 6 \) and if `n > 5`, the condition \( 4 + 2k < n \) holds true. For the next iteration, `k` would be 2 because \( 4 + 2 \cdot 2 = 8 \) and if `n > 7`, the condition \( 4 + 2k < n \) still holds true.
4. **New Value of `cur`**: With `k` now being 2, `cur` becomes \( 2 + 2 = 4 \).
5. **Adjusting `ans`**: The value of `ans` is \( 2k(k + 3) \). With `k` now being 2, `ans` becomes \( 2 \cdot 2 \cdot (2 + 3) = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5 = 20 \).

### Final State
- `'i'` needs to be 3.
- `'cur'` needs to be 4.
- `'n'` must satisfy \( 4 + 2 \cdot 2 < n \) or \( 8 < n \).
- `'ans'` needs to be 20.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is 3, `cur` is 4, `n` must satisfy 8 < n, `ans` is 20**
