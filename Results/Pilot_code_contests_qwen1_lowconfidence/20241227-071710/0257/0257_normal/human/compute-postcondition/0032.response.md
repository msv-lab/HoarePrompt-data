`cur` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `cur` is 4, so after the increment, `cur` becomes 5. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3; `cur` is 5; `n` must be greater than or equal to 12; `ans` is 56.

Output State: **`i` is 3; `cur` is 5; `n` must be greater than or equal to 12; `ans` is 56**
