The code `print(ans)` prints the value of `ans`, but does not change the value of `ans` itself. The values of `i`, `cur`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is the smallest integer such that `(cur - 1) * i > n`, `n` must satisfy this condition, `ans` is `2 * cur * (cur - 1)`. The value of `ans` is printed.**
