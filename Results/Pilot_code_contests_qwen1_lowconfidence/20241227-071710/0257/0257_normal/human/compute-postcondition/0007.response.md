The provided code defines a lambda function `pr` that writes a string to `stdout`. It takes two arguments: `args`, which is an iterable, and `sep`, which is a separator string. The function joins the elements of `args` using `sep` and writes the resulting string followed by a newline to `stdout`.

The lambda function does not assign any new values to existing variables or create new variables. Instead, it simply describes what action would occur if called. Therefore, no variables are changed, and the preconditions remain intact.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of length `n` containing results of `rstr()` calls; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of length `n` containing results of `rint()` calls; `rints_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of length `n` containing results of `rints()` calls; `pr` is a lambda function that writes a string to `stdout`**
