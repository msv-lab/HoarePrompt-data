The code `ans += 4 * cur` updates the value of `ans` by adding `4 * cur` to its current value. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `ans` or `cur`. Therefore, we will represent `ans` and `cur` in their general form, reflecting the addition operation.

Output State: **`ans` is `ans + 4 * cur`, `cur` remains unchanged**
