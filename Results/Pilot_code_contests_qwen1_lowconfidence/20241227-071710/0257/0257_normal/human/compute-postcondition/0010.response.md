To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
- `ans` is 0.
- `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of length `n` containing results of `rstr()` calls.
- `rint_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of length `n` containing results of `rint()` calls.
- `rints_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of length `n` containing results of `rints()` calls.
- `pr` is a lambda function that writes a string to `stdout`.
- `out` is an empty list.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop `for i in range(2, n + 1)` will execute as long as `2 <= i < n + 1`. This means the loop will start with `i = 2` and continue until `i = n`.

2. **Initial State of `i`**: At the start of the loop, `i` should be set to 2 to begin the iteration.

3. **Value of `n`**: The value of `n` should be such that there exists an `i` within the range `[2, n]`. Since the loop condition checks if `2 <= i < n + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

4. **Other Variables**: The values of `ans`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr`, and `out` do not affect the loop's execution directly. However, we need to ensure that these variables are initialized properly as per the problem's context.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` must be 2.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

The initial values of `ans`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr`, and `out` do not need adjustment since they are already provided and do not impact the loop's execution directly.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**.
