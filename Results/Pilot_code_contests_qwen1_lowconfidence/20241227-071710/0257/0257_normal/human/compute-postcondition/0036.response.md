To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the condition of the `while` loop and the current state:

The loop condition is `i * cur <= n`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is 4
- `cur` is 2
- `n` must be at least 12
- `ans` is 20

First, we evaluate the loop condition with the current values:
\[ i \times cur = 4 \times 2 = 8 \]
Since \( 8 \leq 12 \) (which is true because \( n \) is at least 12), the loop can execute.

For the loop to execute again, the next iteration would require:
\[ (i + 1) \times cur \leq n \]

Let's check the updated values:
- The new value of `i` would be 5.
- The new condition would be \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \leq n \).

This means \( n \) must still be at least 12 for the loop to continue executing. No other state changes are necessary because `cur` remains the same and only `i` increases by 1.

So, no adjustments are needed to any of the given states. The loop condition is already satisfied, and the only change is in the value of `i` which naturally increases in each iteration.

State: **`i` is 4, `cur` is 2, `n` must be at least 12, `ans` is 20**
