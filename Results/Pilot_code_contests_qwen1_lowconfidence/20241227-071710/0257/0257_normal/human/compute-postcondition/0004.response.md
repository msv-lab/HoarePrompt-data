The code creates a lambda function `rstr_2d` that generates a list of length `n` where each element is the result of calling the function `rstr()`. However, the function `rstr()` is not defined in the given context, so its exact behavior cannot be determined. Nevertheless, the length of the list generated by `rstr_2d(n)` will be `n`.

Given the initial state where `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\), the lambda function `rstr_2d` is defined but no actual list is generated because the function call itself is not executed. Therefore, the only change is the definition of the lambda function.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100{,}000; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of length `n` containing results of `rstr()` calls.**
