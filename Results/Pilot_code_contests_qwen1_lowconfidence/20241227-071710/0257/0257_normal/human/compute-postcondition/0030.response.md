Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `cur` is 4
   - `n` must satisfy `9 <= n`
   - `ans` is 40

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop continues as long as `i * cur <= n`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i = 3`
   - `cur = 4`
   - Since `i * cur = 3 * 4 = 12`, the condition `i * cur <= n` will hold true as long as `n >= 12`.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes Again:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i * cur` must still be less than or equal to `n`.
   - Given `i = 3` and `cur = 4`, we need `n >= 12` to ensure `i * cur (12) <= n`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - We already know that `n` must satisfy `9 <= n` from the given state.
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` must be at least 12.

6. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - `i` remains 3
   - `cur` remains 4
   - `n` must now satisfy `n >= 12` (to ensure `i * cur (12) <= n`)
   - `ans` remains 40

Therefore, the final state should be:
State: **`i` is 3, `cur` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 12, `ans` is 40**
