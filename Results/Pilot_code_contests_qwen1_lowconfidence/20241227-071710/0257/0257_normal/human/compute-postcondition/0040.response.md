The code `ans += 4 * cur` updates the value of `ans` by adding `4 * cur` to its current value. Given the initial state where `i` is 4, `cur` is 3, `n` must be at least 12, and `ans` is 28, we can calculate the new value of `ans` as follows:

- Initial value of `ans`: 28
- Value of `cur`: 3
- Calculation: `4 * cur` = `4 * 3` = 12
- New value of `ans`: 28 + 12 = 40

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 4, `cur` is 3, `n` must be at least 12, `ans` is 40.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `cur` is 3, `n` must be at least 12, `ans` is 40**
