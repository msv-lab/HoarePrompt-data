The code provided defines a lambda function `rstr` which reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. This does not change the value of `n` or any other variables, it only defines a new function. Therefore, the value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000**
