Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The state at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `ans` is `ans + 4 * (cur + 1)`
  - `cur` is `cur + 1`
- The loop condition:
  - `while i * cur <= n:`

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop continues as long as `i * cur <= n`.

2. **Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - From the given information, we know that `cur` has been incremented by 1 in the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, the new value of `cur` is `cur + 1`.
   - The new value of `ans` is `ans + 4 * (cur + 1)`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i * cur <= n` must still hold true after the increment of `cur`.
   - In the previous iteration, let's denote the old value of `cur` as `old_cur`. After the increment, the new value of `cur` becomes `old_cur + 1`.

4. **Check the Loop Condition with New Value of `cur`**:
   - The condition for the next iteration is `i * (old_cur + 1) <= n`.
   - Since we don't know the exact values of `i`, `old_cur`, and `n`, we need to ensure that this condition holds.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - We need to adjust the state such that the loop condition `i * (old_cur + 1) <= n` is satisfied.
   - Since we cannot assume specific values for `i`, `old_cur`, and `n`, the only thing we can control is the relationship between these values.

### Conclusion

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the relationship between `i`, `old_cur + 1`, and `n` must be maintained. However, since the exact values are not specified, we need to ensure that `i * (old_cur + 1) <= n` is possible.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `ans` remains the same as `ans + 4 * (cur + 1)`.
- `cur` remains the same as `cur + 1`.

Since we cannot simplify further without knowing the exact values, the state should be kept as is.

### Final Answer
State: **`ans` is `ans + 4 * (cur + 1)`, `cur` is `cur + 1`**
