The code defines a lambda function `rint_2d` which creates a list of length `n` by calling `rint()` `n` times. However, since `rint()` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values it returns. The only thing we know for sure is that `rint_2d` will create a list of length `n`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of length `n` containing results of `rstr()` calls; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of length `n` containing results of `rint()` calls.**
