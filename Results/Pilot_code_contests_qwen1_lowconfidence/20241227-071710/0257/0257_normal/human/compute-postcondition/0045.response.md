Let's analyze the loop step by step based on the provided information.

### Initial State:
- `i = 4`
- `cur = 2`
- `n ≥ 12`
- `ans = 20`

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as `i * cur ≤ n`.

### Loop Body:
- `ans += 4 * cur`
- `cur += 1`

### Observations from Given Iterations:
1. **After 1 iteration**:
   - `i = 4`
   - `cur = 3`
   - `n ≥ 12`
   - `ans = 28`

2. **After 2 iterations**:
   - `i = 4`
   - `cur = 4`
   - `n ≥ 12`
   - `ans = 40`

3. **After 3 iterations**:
   - `i = 4`
   - `cur = 5`
   - `n ≥ 16`
   - `ans = 56`

### Analysis:
From the above observations, we can deduce the following:
- `i` remains constant at 4 throughout the loop.
- `cur` increases by 1 each time the loop iterates.
- `ans` is updated by adding `4 * cur` each iteration.
- The condition `i * cur ≤ n` must be true for the loop to continue. This implies that `n` must be at least large enough to accommodate the increasing value of `i * cur`.

### General Form:
- After \( k \) iterations:
  - `i = 4`
  - `cur = 2 + k`
  - `n ≥ i * (2 + k - 1) = 4 * (k + 1)`
  - `ans = 20 + 4 * (2 + 3 + ... + (2 + k - 1))`

The sum of the arithmetic series `2 + 3 + ... + (2 + k - 1)` can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Sum} = \sum_{j=1}^{k} (1 + j) = k + \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \]

So,
\[ ans = 20 + 4 \left( k + \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \right) = 20 + 2k(k + 1) \]

When the loop terminates, `cur` will be the smallest integer such that `i * cur > n`. Therefore, the final `cur` value will be `2 + k + 1` where `k` is the number of iterations.

### Final Output State:
- `i = 4`
- `cur` is the smallest integer such that `4 * (cur - 1) > n`, so `cur = k + 2` where `k` is the number of iterations.
- `n` must be at least `4 * (k + 1)`
- `ans = 20 + 2k(k + 1)`

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is:
Output State: **`i` is 4, `cur` is the smallest integer such that `4 * (cur - 1) > n`, `n` must be at least `4 * (cur - 1)`, `ans` is `20 + 2(cur - 2)(cur - 1)`**
