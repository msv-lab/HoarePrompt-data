The code defines a lambda function `rints_2d` which generates a list of length `n` where each element is the result of calling `rints()`. Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, the lambda function `rints_2d` will create a list of length `n` filled with the results of `rints()` calls. However, the actual values of these results are not specified, so they remain as the results of `rints()` calls.

The initial state of `rstr_2d` and `rint_2d` remains unchanged, as the code only defines a new lambda function `rints_2d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of length `n` containing results of `rstr()` calls; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of length `n` containing results of `rint()` calls; `rints_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of length `n` containing results of `rints()` calls.**
