Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current States:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 4
   - `cur` is 3
   - `ans` is 8

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `i * cur <= n`.

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, `cur` is 3, and `n` must be at least 4.
   - The condition `i * cur <= n` becomes `2 * 3 <= n` or `6 <= n`.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `6 <= n` must be true.
   - Since `n` must be at least 4 at the start of the loop, we need to ensure that `n` is such that the condition `6 <= n` holds true.

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - We need to adjust `n` so that `6 <= n` is satisfied. Given that `n` must be at least 4 initially and must now satisfy `6 <= n`, we can set `n` to be at least 6.

6. **Final State:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

Therefore, the final state should be:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 6, `cur` is 3, `ans` is 8**
