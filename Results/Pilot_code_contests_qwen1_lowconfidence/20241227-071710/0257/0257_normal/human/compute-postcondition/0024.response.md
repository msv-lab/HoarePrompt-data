State right before the while loop: `i` is 3, `cur` is 2, `n` must satisfy 8 < n, `ans` is 20.

```
while i * cur <= n:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step analysis:

1. The condition for the loop to continue is `i * cur <= n`.
2. Right before the loop, the values are:
   - `i` is 3
   - `cur` is 2
   - `n` must satisfy 8 < n
   - `ans` is 20 (this state does not directly affect the loop condition)

3. Calculate the current value of `i * cur`:
   - `i * cur = 3 * 2 = 6`

4. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i * cur <= n` must be true after incrementing either `i`, `cur`, or decreasing `n`.

5. Since `i` and `cur` are constants (3 and 2 respectively), they cannot be modified. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` such that `6 <= n` holds true.

Given that `n` must already satisfy 8 < n, we need to ensure that the loop condition remains true after one iteration. This means `n` should be at least 7 initially to allow the loop to execute once, but since it must satisfy 8 < n, we confirm that `n` must be greater than 8.

Therefore, no further adjustments are necessary because the condition `i * cur <= n` will hold as long as `n` satisfies 8 < n, and the loop will execute once.

State: **`i` is 3, `cur` is 2, `n` must satisfy 8 < n, `ans` is 20**
