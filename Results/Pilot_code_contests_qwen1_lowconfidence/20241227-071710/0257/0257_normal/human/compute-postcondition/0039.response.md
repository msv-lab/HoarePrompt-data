Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 4
   - `cur` is 3
   - `n` must be at least 12
   - `ans` is 28

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i * cur <= n`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i = 4`
   - `cur = 3`
   - `n >= 12`

4. **Evaluate the Loop Condition:**
   - Current condition: `i * cur = 4 * 3 = 12`
   - Since `12 <= 12` (which is true because `n` is at least 12), the loop can execute one more time.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the condition `i * cur <= n` remains true.
   - We already know `i` and `cur` will remain the same for the next iteration, so the main adjustment needed is ensuring `n` remains such that `i * cur <= n` holds true.
   - Since `i * cur = 12`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 12 for the loop to continue. Given that `n` is at least 12 initially, it will still be at least 12 in the next iteration.

6. **No Other Adjustments Needed:**
   - `i` and `cur` do not need to be adjusted as they remain constant within the loop.
   - `ans` does not directly affect the loop condition and will be updated inside the loop body.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 4, `cur` is 3, `n` must be at least 12, `ans` is 28**
