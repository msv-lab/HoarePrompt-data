`ans` is assigned the value of `ans` plus `4 * cur`. Given the initial state where `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 4, and `cur` is 2, the value of `cur` is multiplied by 4 and added to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` becomes `4 * 2`, which is 8.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 4, `cur` is 2, `ans` is 8**
