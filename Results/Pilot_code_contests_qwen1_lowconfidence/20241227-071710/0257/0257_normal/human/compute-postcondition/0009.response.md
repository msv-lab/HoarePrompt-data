The code reads an integer `n` from input and assigns it to `n`, while also initializing `ans` to 0. The lambda functions and the empty list `out` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `ans` is 0; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of length `n` containing results of `rstr()` calls; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of length `n` containing results of `rint()` calls; `rints_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of length `n` containing results of `rints()` calls; `pr` is a lambda function that writes a string to `stdout`; `out` is an empty list.**
