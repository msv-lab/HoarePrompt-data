The provided code defines a lambda function named `rints` which reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and converts each string into an integer, returning a list of these integers. However, the code does not actually call this lambda function or perform any operations with the list it returns. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000**
