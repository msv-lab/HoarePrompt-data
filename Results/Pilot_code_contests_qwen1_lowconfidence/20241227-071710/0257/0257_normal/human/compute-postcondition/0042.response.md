Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the current state step by step:

The `while` loop condition is:
\[ \text{while } i \times cur \leq n \]

At the end of the previous iteration:
- \( i = 4 \)
- \( cur = 4 \)
- \( n \) must be at least 12
- \( ans = 40 \)

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition \( i \times cur \leq n \) must hold true.

Currently:
\[ i \times cur = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Since \( n \) must be at least 12, for the loop to continue, \( n \) must be at least 16 because 16 is greater than the current minimum requirement of 12.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that \( n \) is at least 16.

No other states need to be adjusted as they don't affect the loop continuation directly based on the given condition.

So, the modified state for the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 4; `cur` is 4; `n` must be at least 16; `ans` is 40**
