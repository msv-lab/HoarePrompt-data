The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on some internal logic since no parameters are provided. However, given the constraints that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, it implies that the function might internally use an integer within this range.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on internal logic, though no parameters are explicitly accepted.**
