The code defines a lambda function named `rint` that reads an integer from standard input (`stdin.readline()`) and converts it to an integer using `int()`. This function does not assign the value read to any variable; it only defines the function itself. Therefore, the value of `n` remains unchanged, and no new variables are created.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000**
