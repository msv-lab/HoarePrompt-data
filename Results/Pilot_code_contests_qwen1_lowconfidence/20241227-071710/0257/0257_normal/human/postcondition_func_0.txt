The function calculates a specific mathematical value based on the input integer `n`. It starts by reading an integer `n` from standard input, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000`. For each integer `i` starting from 2 up to `n`, it finds the smallest integer `cur` such that `i * cur` exceeds `n`. It then adds `4 * cur` to the accumulator `ans`. After the loop completes, it prints the final value of `ans`. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. Potential edge cases include the minimum and maximum values of `n`, and the case when `n` is exactly equal to 2, where `ans` would be 4 since the loop would not execute.
