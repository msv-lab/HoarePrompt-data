Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. According to the problem description, for every pair of integers \(a\) and \(b\) (where \(2 \leq |a|, |b| \leq n\)), you can transform \(a\) into \(b\) if there exists an integer \(x\) such that \(1 < |x|\) and \(a \cdot x = b\) or \(b \cdot x = a\). The code attempts to calculate a score based on the given \(n\) by iterating through all integers from 2 to \(n\) and adding \(4 \times \text{cur}\) to the score, where \(\text{cur}\) is the smallest integer such that \(i \times \text{cur} > n\).

However, the logic in the code does not actually simulate the transformation process described in the problem. Instead, it appears to be calculating a score based on a different mathematical relationship, which does not align with the problem requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to simulate the transformation process and keep track of the scores based on the valid transformations between pairs of integers. The current implementation does not do this and therefore does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
