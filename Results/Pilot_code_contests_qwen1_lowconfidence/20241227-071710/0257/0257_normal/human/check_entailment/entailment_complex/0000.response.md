Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not simulate the transformation process or correctly calculate the maximum score based on the given rules. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - For each pair of integers \(a\) and \(b\) where \(2 \leq |a|, |b| \leq n\), there must exist an integer \(x\) such that \(1 < |x|\) and either \(a \cdot x = b\) or \(b \cdot x = a\).
   - The score increases by \(|x|\) points per transformation.
   - You cannot transform \(a\) into \(b\) and vice versa.
   - The goal is to find the maximum score achievable.

2. **Program Implementation Analysis**:
   - The program reads an integer \(n\) and then enters a loop where it iterates over each integer \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the smallest integer \(cur\) such that \(i \cdot cur > n\).
   - It then adds \(4 \cdot cur\) to the accumulator `ans`.

3. **Why the Program is Incorrect**:
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly simulate the transformation process described in the problem.
   - The calculation \(4 \cdot cur\) does not account for the actual transformations or scores based on the given rules.
   - The program does not consider the transformations between pairs of integers or keep track of which integers have been transformed.
   - The final result `ans` does not represent the maximum score achievable according to the problem statement.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve this problem, you would need to consider all pairs of integers \(a\) and \(b\) within the specified range and determine the maximum score by exploring possible transformations.
   - The current implementation does not handle these transformations and simply performs a fixed calculation based on the input \(n\).

Given these observations, the program does not follow the problem description and therefore is incorrect.
