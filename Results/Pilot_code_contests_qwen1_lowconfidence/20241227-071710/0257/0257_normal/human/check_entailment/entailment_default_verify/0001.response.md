Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the case when `n = 2`. According to the problem description, if `n` is 2, it is impossible to perform even a single transformation, so the output should be 0. However, the program calculates `ans += 4 * cur` for `i = 2` and `cur = 1`, resulting in `ans = 4`. This violates the requirement specified in the problem description, making the program incorrect for `n = 2`. Therefore, the original assessment remains correct.
