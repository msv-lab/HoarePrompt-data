Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the input `n` is 2 correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is 2, it is impossible to perform even a single transformation, so the output should be 0. However, the program calculates the score based on the formula `ans += 4 * cur` for each integer from 2 to `n`, which will result in a non-zero output for `n = 2`. Specifically, the program will calculate `ans += 4 * 1` (since `cur` starts from 2 and `i * cur <= n` holds true only for `i = 2` and `cur = 1`), resulting in `ans = 4`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement for the case when `n = 2`, making it incorrect.
