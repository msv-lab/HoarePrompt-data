Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the code does not account for all possible transformations between pairs of integers \(a\) and \(b\) within the range \([2, n]\). The code assumes that the transformation can only occur if \(i * cur > n\), which is not correct according to the problem statement.

According to the problem description, for every pair of integers \(a\) and \(b\) (where \(2 \leq |a|, |b| \leq n\)), there should exist an integer \(x\) such that \(1 < |x|\) and either \(a \cdot x = b\) or \(b \cdot x = a\). The code only considers transformations where \(i * cur > n\), which does not cover all possible valid transformations.

For example, consider \(n = 4\):
- According to the problem, valid transformations include \(2 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow -2 \rightarrow -4 \rightarrow 2\).
- However, the code only considers transformations where \(i * cur > n\), which does not capture these cyclic transformations.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, leading to an incorrect implementation.
