Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the problem description, when `n = 2`, it is impossible to perform any transformation, and thus the output should be `0`. However, the annotated version shows that the program calculates `ans += 4 * cur` for each integer from `2` to `n`, which results in `ans = 4` when `n = 2`. This is because the program starts the loop with `cur = 2`, and the condition `i * cur <= n` is satisfied only once (for `i = 2` and `cur = 1`), leading to `ans += 4 * 1 = 4`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement for the case when `n = 2`, making it incorrect.
