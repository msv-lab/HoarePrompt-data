Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the program calculates the score based on the formula `ans += 4 * cur` for each integer from 2 to `n`. For `n = 2`, the program will calculate `ans += 4 * 1`, resulting in `ans = 4`. According to the problem description, if `n` is 2, it is impossible to perform even a single transformation, so the output should be 0. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement for the case when `n = 2`, making it incorrect. The annotated version supports this conclusion.
