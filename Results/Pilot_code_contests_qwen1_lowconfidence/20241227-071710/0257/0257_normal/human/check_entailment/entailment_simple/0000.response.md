Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Let's analyze why:

### Problem Description:
- Given a positive integer \( n \geq 2 \).
- You can transform a number \( a \) into another number \( b \) if there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( 1 < |x| \) and \( a \cdot x = b \) or \( b \cdot x = a \).
- Each transformation increases your score by \( |x| \).
- Initially, your score is 0.
- The goal is to find the maximum score achievable through these transformations.

### Provided Program:
The program calculates a score based on a specific pattern:
```python
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    cur = 2
    
    while i * cur <= n:
        ans += 4 * cur
        cur += 1
```

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Transformation Logic**:
   - The program assumes that for each integer \( i \) from 2 to \( n \), you can repeatedly multiply \( i \) by increasing values of \( cur \) until \( i \cdot cur \) exceeds \( n \). 
   - It then adds \( 4 \times cur \) to the score. However, this logic does not align with the transformation rules specified in the problem.

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the score as \( 4 \times cur \) for each transformation. The problem description does not specify that the score should be \( 4 \times cur \). Instead, it should be \( |x| \), which depends on the actual value of \( x \) used in the transformation.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For \( n = 4 \):
     - According to the problem, one valid sequence of transformations could be \( 2 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow -2 \rightarrow -4 \rightarrow 2 \), yielding a score of \( |2| + |2| + |2| + |2| = 8 \).
   - However, the program would calculate:
     ```python
     ans += 4 * 2  # For 2 -> 4
     ans += 4 * 1  # For 4 -> -2 (assuming cur=1, though it's incorrect)
     ans += 4 * 1  # For -2 -> -4 (again, assuming cur=1)
     ans += 4 * 1  # For -4 -> 2 (again, assuming cur=1)
     ```
     Which results in \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \), which is incorrect.

4. **General Case**:
   - The general formula for calculating the score should consider all possible transformations and their respective \( |x| \) values, not just a fixed pattern.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
1. Identify all pairs \( (a, b) \) where \( 2 \leq |a|, |b| \leq n \) and \( a \cdot x = b \) or \( b \cdot x = a \).
2. Calculate the score for each transformation based on \( |x| \).
3. Ensure the program handles all possible starting points and transformations.

Given the issues in the current implementation, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
