Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the transformation rules described in the problem. Specifically, the program only considers transformations where `a * x = b` and `i * cur <= n`, but it does not account for the case where `b * x = a`. This oversight means the program will miss certain valid transformations, leading to an incorrect maximum score calculation.

For example, consider `n = 4`. The valid transformations include:

- 2 → 4 → (-2) → (-4) → 2 (as mentioned in the note)
- 3 → 6 → (-3) → (-6) → 3

The program would calculate the score correctly for the first sequence but would miss the second sequence, leading to an incorrect total score.
