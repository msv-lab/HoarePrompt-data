The function `func_3` accepts a list `args` of n integers (where n is such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a boolean `verbose`. It first calls another function `func_2` to process the input list and store the result in `a_s`. Then, it iterates over the list to find the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements (`max_1`). After that, it iterates over the list again to find the minimum difference between every third element starting from the third element to the last element (`min_2`). Finally, it returns the higher value between `max_1` and `min_2`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If the input list `args` has fewer than 3 elements, the function will still attempt to process it. However, since `a_s` is derived from `args`, the length checks in the loops ensure that the indices used for `a_s` are valid. Therefore, no additional handling is needed for lists shorter than 3 elements.
2. The function assumes that `a_s` is a valid list of integers and that the input `args` can be processed by `func_2`. If `func_2` fails or returns an invalid list, the function's behavior is undefined. No error checking is performed on the output of `func_2`.

The function's purpose is to find the highest of either the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements or the minimum difference between every third element in the list. After executing the function, the program's state will have determined these two values and returned the higher one.
