The function `func_4` accepts a string representing space-separated integers indicating the heights of the holds on the wall. It first converts this string into a list of integers using `func_1`. Then, it iterates through each integer in the list, temporarily removes one hold at a time, and calculates the difficulty of the track without that hold using `func_3`. Finally, it returns the minimum difficulty found among all possible removals of one hold. Potential edge cases include handling an empty string or a string with invalid input (e.g., non-integer values). If the input string is empty or contains invalid data, the function should handle these cases appropriately.
