Precondition: **`func_4` does not take any parameters directly. However, it refers to functions `func_1` and `func_3`. The input to `func_4` is expected to be a string '1 2 3' or similar test cases provided in the assertions, where the string represents space-separated integers indicating the heights of the holds on the wall. `func_1` is assumed to parse this string into a list of integers, and `func_3` is assumed to take a string representing the test case and return the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold.**
