Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the requirement to find the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold. Specifically, the function `func_3` is designed to find the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements and the minimum difference between every third element, but this does not account for the scenario where removing a hold changes the difficulty.

To illustrate, consider the following:

1. **Input**: `3 4 6 9`
   - Without removing any hold, the difficulty is `9 - 3 = 6`.
   - Removing the second hold (`4`) results in `3 6 9`, with difficulty `9 - 3 = 6`.
   - Removing the third hold (`6`) results in `3 4 9`, with difficulty `9 - 4 = 5`.
   - The correct minimum difficulty after removing one hold is `5`.

However, the current implementation in `func_3` does not account for this scenario. Instead, it finds the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements and the minimum difference between every third element, which does not necessarily reflect the actual difficulty after removing a hold.

The function `func_3` should iterate over all possible removals of one hold and compute the difficulty for each case, then return the minimum difficulty. Here is an example of how the corrected implementation could look:

```python
def func_3(args, verbose=False):
    a_s = func_2(args)
    min_difficulty = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, len(a_s) - 1):
        # Remove the i-th hold and compute the new difficulty
        new_difficulty = max(a_s[i-1] - a_s[i-2], a_s[i] - a_s[i-1], a_s[-1] - a_s[-2])
        min_difficulty = min(min_difficulty, new_difficulty)
    return min_difficulty
```

This corrected implementation iterates over all possible removals of one hold, computes the difficulty for each case, and returns the minimum difficulty.
