Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not account for the scenario where the removed hold is not the first or last element. Instead, it calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements and the minimum difference between every third element, which is not the correct approach.

To fix this, the code should consider the effect of removing each hold (except the first and last) on the maximum difference between adjacent elements. Here is a corrected version of the `func_3` function:

```python
def func_3(args, verbose=False):
    a_s = func_2(args)
    n = len(a_s)
    max_diff = -float('inf')
    
    # Calculate the maximum difference after removing each hold
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        current_diff = max(a_s[i] - a_s[i - 1], a_s[i + 1] - a_s[i])
        max_diff = max(max_diff, current_diff)
    
    return max_diff
```

This corrected function iterates through each hold (except the first and last) and calculates the maximum difference between the hold being removed and its adjacent holds. This ensures that the function correctly finds the minimum difficulty after removing one hold.
