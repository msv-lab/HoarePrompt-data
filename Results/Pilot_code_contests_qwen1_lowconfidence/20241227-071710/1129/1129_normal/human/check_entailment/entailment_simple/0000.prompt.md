You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Mike is trying rock climbing but he is awful at it. 

There are n holds on the wall, i-th hold is at height ai off the ground. Besides, let the sequence ai increase, that is, ai < ai + 1 for all i from 1 to n - 1; we will call such sequence a track. Mike thinks that the track a1, ..., an has difficulty <image>. In other words, difficulty equals the maximum distance between two holds that are adjacent in height.

Today Mike decided to cover the track with holds hanging on heights a1, ..., an. To make the problem harder, Mike decided to remove one hold, that is, remove one element of the sequence (for example, if we take the sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and remove the third element from it, we obtain the sequence (1, 2, 4, 5)). However, as Mike is awful at climbing, he wants the final difficulty (i.e. the maximum difference of heights between adjacent holds after removing the hold) to be as small as possible among all possible options of removing a hold. The first and last holds must stay at their positions.

Help Mike determine the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of holds.

The next line contains n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000), where ai is the height where the hold number i hangs. The sequence ai is increasing (i.e. each element except for the first one is strictly larger than the previous one).

Output

Print a single number — the minimum difficulty of the track after removing a single hold.

Examples

1 4 6


Output

5

5
1 2 3 7 8


Output

4

Note

In the first sample you can remove only the second hold, then the sequence looks like (1, 6), the maximum difference of the neighboring elements equals 5.

In the second test after removing every hold the difficulty equals 2.

In the third test you can obtain sequences (1, 3, 7, 8), (1, 2, 7, 8), (1, 2, 3, 8), for which the difficulty is 4, 5 and 5, respectively. Thus, after removing the second element we obtain the optimal answer — 4.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import fileinput

if __name__ == '__main__':
    from sys import argv
    if argv.pop() == 'test':
        func_4()
    else:
        func_3(list(fileinput.input()), verbose=True)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string containing n space-separated integers ai, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000, and the sequence ai is increasing.
def func_1(s):
    return [int(x) for x in s.split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from a string `s` containing n space-separated integers ai, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000, and the sequence ai is increasing

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a list containing at least one element, where args[1] is a list of integers representing the heights of the holds (ai), and the list is already sorted in increasing order.
def func_2(args):
    a_s = tuple(func_1(args[1]))
    return a_s
    #The program returns a_s which is a tuple containing the same elements as args[1], a list of integers representing the heights of the holds, sorted in increasing order

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a_s is a list of n integers representing the heights of the holds, where n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list is sorted in strictly increasing order.
def func_3(args, verbose):
    a_s = func_2(args)
    max_1 = -float('inf')
    min_2 = float('inf')
    for k in xrange(len(a_s) - 1):
        max_1 = max(max_1, a_s[k + 1] - a_s[k])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_1` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `a_s`, `k` is `n-2`, and `len(a_s) - 1` is greater than 0.
    for k in xrange(len(a_s) - 2):
        min_2 = min(min_2, a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_1` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `a_s`, `k` is 0 (or -1 if `len(a_s)` is less than 2), and `min_2` is the minimum difference between every third element in the list `a_s` starting from the third element to the last element.
    return max(max_1, min_2)
    #The program returns the higher value between max_1 (the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `a_s`) and min_2 (the minimum difference between every third element in the list `a_s` starting from the third element to the last element)

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `func_4` does not take any parameters directly. However, it refers to functions `func_1` and `func_3`. The input to `func_4` is expected to be a string '1 2 3' or similar test cases provided in the assertions, where the string represents space-separated integers indicating the heights of the holds on the wall. `func_1` is assumed to parse this string into a list of integers, and `func_3` is assumed to take a string representing the test case and return the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold.
def func_4():


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
