Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem described. Specifically, the program does not find the minimum difficulty after removing one hold from the track. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Difference Between Adjacent Elements:**
   - The function `func_3` calculates the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements (`max_1`). However, this does not account for the scenario where the removed hold could change the maximum difference between adjacent elements.
   
2. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Difference Between Every Third Element:**
   - The function `func_3` also calculates the minimum difference between every third element (`min_2`). This approach is not relevant to the problem as it does not consider the removal of a single hold to minimize the maximum difference between adjacent elements.

3. **Missing Logic for Removing a Hold:**
   - The program does not implement any logic to simulate the removal of a single hold and calculate the resulting difficulty. It only computes the maximum and minimum differences without considering the removal of any specific hold.

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate through all possible scenarios where each hold is removed and compute the resulting difficulty. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_3(args):
    a_s = [int(x) for x in args]
    min_difficulty = float('inf')
    
    for i in range(1, len(a_s) - 1):
        # Create a new list without the i-th element
        a_s_without_i = a_s[:i] + a_s[i+1:]
        max_diff = max(a_s_without_i[j+1] - a_s_without_i[j] for j in range(len(a_s_without_i) - 1))
        min_difficulty = min(min_difficulty, max_diff)
        
    return min_difficulty

if __name__ == '__main__':
    from sys import argv
    if argv.pop() == 'test':
        func_4()
    else:
        s = list(input().strip().split())
        print(func_3(s))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Iterate Through All Holds:** The program iterates through each possible hold to remove (from index 1 to n-2).
- **Remove Each Hold:** For each hold, it creates a new list without that hold.
- **Calculate Maximum Difference:** It calculates the maximum difference between adjacent elements in the new list.
- **Track Minimum Difficulty:** It tracks the minimum of these maximum differences.

This approach ensures that the program considers all possible scenarios of removing one hold and finds the configuration that minimizes the difficulty.
