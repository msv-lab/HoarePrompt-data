The function `func_2` accepts a single parameter `args`, which is expected to be a list where `args[1]` is a list of integers representing the heights of the holds, sorted in increasing order. The function calls another function `func_1` with `args[1]` as its argument, converts the result into a tuple, and returns this tuple. The returned tuple contains the same elements as `args[1]`, ensuring they are also sorted in increasing order. This means the function guarantees to return a sorted tuple of integers representing the heights of the holds. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `args` does not contain exactly two elements, or `args[1]` is an empty list. In such cases, the function would still attempt to access `args[1]`, leading to potential errors. However, assuming `args` is correctly formatted, the function will always return a sorted tuple of integers.
