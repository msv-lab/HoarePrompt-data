The code initializes `min_2` to `float('inf')`. This does not affect the value of `a_s` or `max_1`. Therefore, the only changes are to the values of `min_2`.

Output State: **`a_s` is a list of n integers representing the heights of the holds, where n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list is sorted in strictly increasing order; `max_1` is -inf; `min_2` is float('inf')**
