The code updates `max_1` to be the maximum between its current value and the difference between `a_s[k + 1]` and `a_s[k]`. Given the initial state:

- `max_1` is either its original value or `a_s[1] - a_s[0]`
- `k` is 1
- `len(a_s) - 1` is greater than 0 (which implies `len(a_s)` is at least 2)

Since `k` is 1, the expression `a_s[k + 1] - a_s[k]` translates to `a_s[2] - a_s[1]`.

The value of `max_1` will now be updated to the maximum of its current value and `a_s[2] - a_s[1]`. The states of the other variables (`k` and the condition regarding `len(a_s)`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_1` is the maximum of its original value (or `a_s[1] - a_s[0]`) and `a_s[2] - a_s[1]`, `k` is 1, and `len(a_s) - 1` is greater than 0**
