Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all iterations.

### Initial State:
- `a_s` is a list of \( n \) integers representing the heights of the holds, where \( 3 \leq n \leq 100 \) and the list is sorted in strictly increasing order.
- `max_1` is initialized to \(-\infty\).
- `min_2` is initialized to \(+\infty\).

### Loop Code:
```python
for k in range(len(a_s) - 1):
    max_1 = max(max_1, a_s[k + 1] - a_s[k])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `max_1` starts at \(-\infty\).

2. **First Iteration (k=0)**:
   - `max_1` is updated to \(\max(-\infty, a_s[1] - a_s[0])\), which simplifies to \(a_s[1] - a_s[0]\) since \(a_s[1] - a_s[0] > -\infty\).
   - `k` is now 0.

3. **Second Iteration (k=1)**:
   - `max_1` is updated to \(\max(a_s[1] - a_s[0], a_s[2] - a_s[1])\).
   - `k` is now 1.

4. **Third Iteration (k=2)**:
   - `max_1` is updated to \(\max(a_s[1] - a_s[0], a_s[2] - a_s[1], a_s[3] - a_s[2])\).
   - `k` is now 2.

5. **General Iteration (k-th iteration)**:
   - `max_1` is updated to \(\max(\text{current } max_1, a_s[k + 1] - a_s[k])\) for each \(k\) from 0 to \(n-2\).
   - After all iterations, `k` will be \(n-2\).

### Final State Analysis:
After all iterations of the loop, `max_1` will hold the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `a_s`.

### Output State:
- `max_1` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `a_s`.
- `k` is \(n-2\) because the loop runs \(n-2\) times.
- `len(a_s) - 1` is greater than 0, ensuring the loop runs at least once.

Thus, the final output state of the loop is:
Output State: **`max_1` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `a_s`, `k` is `n-2`, and `len(a_s) - 1` is greater than 0.**
