The function `func_4` does not directly accept any parameters. Instead, it relies on two other functions, `func_1` and `func_3`, to process the input string '1 2 3'. The input string is expected to represent space-separated integers indicating the heights of the holds on the wall. 

- `func_1` is assumed to parse the string into a list of integers.
- `func_3` is assumed to take a string representing the test case and return the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold.

Given the above, the function `func_4` accepts a string input '1 2 3' (or similar test cases), processes it using `func_1` to convert it into a list of integers, then uses `func_3` to determine the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold from the parsed list of integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string representing space-separated integers indicating the heights of the holds on the wall, converts this string into a list of integers using `func_1`, and then returns the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold as determined by `func_3`.**
