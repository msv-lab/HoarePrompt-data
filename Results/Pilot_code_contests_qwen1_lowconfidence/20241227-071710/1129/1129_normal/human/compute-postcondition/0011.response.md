The code `min_2 = min(min_2, a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k])` impacts the program by updating the value of `min_2`. Given the initial state, `k` is set to `n - 2`, and `n` is less than the length of the list `a_s`. This means `k + 2` is within the bounds of the list `a_s`. The expression `a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k]` calculates the difference between the element at index `k + 2` and the element at index `k`. This difference is then compared to the current value of `min_2`, and `min_2` is updated to the minimum of these two values.

Since `max_1` is defined as the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `a_s`, it remains unchanged by this line of code. `k` also remains unchanged as the operation only updates `min_2`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`max_1` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `a_s`, `k` is `n-2`, and `min_2` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k]`.**
