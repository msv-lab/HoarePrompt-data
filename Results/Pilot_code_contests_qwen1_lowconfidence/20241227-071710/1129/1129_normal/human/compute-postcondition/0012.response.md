Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Initial State:**
   - `max_1` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `a_s`.
   - `k` is `n-2`, where `n` is the length of the list `a_s`.
   - `min_2` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k]`.

2. **Determine the Range of the For Loop:**
   - The for loop iterates over `k` from `0` to `len(a_s) - 3`.

3. **Analyze the Current Value of `k`:**
   - Since `k` is `n-2`, it means that currently, `k` is `len(a_s) - 2`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `k`:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be `len(a_s) - 3`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `max_1` remains unchanged as it is based on the values of the list `a_s` and not directly dependent on `k`.
   - `k` should be set to `len(a_s) - 3`.
   - `min_2` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and `a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k]`, but since `k` is now `len(a_s) - 3`, we need to check the condition for the new value of `k`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`max_1` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `a_s`, `k` is `len(a_s) - 3`, and `min_2` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k]`**.
