Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop variable and its range:**
   The loop variable `k` is iterating through the range from `0` to `len(a_s) - 3`. This means `k` starts from `0` and goes up to `len(a_s) - 3 - 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `max_1` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `a_s`.
   - `k` is currently `len(a_s) - 3`.
   - `min_2` is the difference `a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k]`.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes `len(a_s) - 2`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - `max_1` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the value of `k`.
   - `k` changes from `len(a_s) - 3` to `len(a_s) - 2`.
   - `min_2` will now be the difference `a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k]`, which is `a_s[len(a_s) - 2 + 2] - a_s[len(a_s) - 2] = a_s[len(a_s) - 1] - a_s[len(a_s) - 2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`max_1` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `a_s`, `k` is `len(a_s) - 2`, and `min_2` is `a_s[len(a_s) - 1] - a_s[len(a_s) - 2]`**.
