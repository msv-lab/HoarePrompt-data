According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the length of the list `a_s`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `len(a_s) - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `len(a_s) - 1` is greater than 0.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if `k + 1` is less than `len(a_s) - 1`.

Given that `k` is currently 1, `k + 1` would be 2. For the loop to execute again, `len(a_s) - 1` must still be greater than 0, which it is according to the current state. Therefore, `k` will be incremented to 2.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `k` will be 2, and the condition `len(a_s) - 1` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`max_1` is the maximum of its original value (or `a_s[1] - a_s[0]`) and `a_s[2] - a_s[1]`, `k` is 2, and `len(a_s) - 1` is greater than 0**
