Output State: **`max_1` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `a_s`, `k` is 0 (or -1 if `len(a_s)` is less than 2), and `min_2` is the minimum difference between every third element in the list `a_s` starting from the third element to the last element.** 

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `max_1` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `a_s`.
   - `k` starts as `n-2`, which means `k` starts as `len(a_s) - 2`.
   - `min_2` is initially set to `a_s[len(a_s) - 1] - a_s[len(a_s) - 2]`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `k = len(a_s) - 2` down to `k = 0` (or -1 if `len(a_s) < 2`).
   - In each iteration, `min_2` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k]`.

3. **Final Values After Loop Execution:**
   - After the loop completes, `k` will be 0 (or -1 if `len(a_s) < 2`).
   - `min_2` will hold the minimum value among all the differences `a_s[i + 2] - a_s[i]` for `i` ranging from `len(a_s) - 2` down to 0.

4. **Case When Loop Does Not Execute:**
   - If `len(a_s) - 1` is less than 2 (i.e., `len(a_s) < 2`), the loop does not execute.
   - In this case, `k` remains `n-2`, and `min_2` remains `a_s[len(a_s) - 1] - a_s[len(a_s) - 2]`.

Therefore, the final output state captures the values of `max_1`, `k`, and `min_2` after the loop has completed its execution.
