According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the length of the list `a_s`. The loop condition is that `k` must be less than `len(a_s) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `max_1` is either its original value or `a_s[1] - a_s[0]`, `k` is 0, and `len(a_s) - 1` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. Additionally, `len(a_s) - 1` must still be greater than 0 to ensure the loop condition holds true.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`max_1` is either its original value or `a_s[1] - a_s[0]`, `k` is 1, and `len(a_s) - 1` is greater than 0**
