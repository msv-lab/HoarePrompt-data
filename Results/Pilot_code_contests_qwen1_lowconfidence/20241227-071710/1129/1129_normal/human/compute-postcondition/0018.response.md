The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `args`, which is a list of n integers representing the heights of the holds, and `verbose`, which is a boolean indicating whether detailed information should be printed.

The function calculates:
- `max_1`, which is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `a_s`.
- `min_2`, which is the minimum difference between every third element in the list `a_s` starting from the third element to the last element.

The function then returns the higher value between `max_1` and `min_2`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a list `args` of n integers (where n is between 3 and 100, inclusive) and a boolean `verbose`, and return the higher value between the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in the list and the minimum difference between every third element in the list starting from the third element to the last element.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `args` of n integers and a boolean `verbose`, and returns the higher value between the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in the list and the minimum difference between every third element in the list starting from the third element to the last element.**
