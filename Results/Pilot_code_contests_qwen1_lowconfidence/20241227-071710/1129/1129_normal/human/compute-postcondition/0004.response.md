The variable `max_1` is assigned the maximum value between `max_1` and `a_s[k + 1] - a_s[k]`. However, the initial value of `max_1` is not specified in the initial state, so we will denote it as `max_1` for now. The variable `k` remains unchanged and is set to 0 initially. The value of `a_s[k + 1] - a_s[k]` is calculated, which is `a_s[1] - a_s[0]` since `k` is 0. This value is then compared with `max_1` and assigned to `max_1`.

Since `max_1` could be either its original value or the new value `a_s[1] - a_s[0]`, the output state will reflect this.

Output State: **`max_1` is either its original value or `a_s[1] - a_s[0]`, `k` is 0, and `len(a_s) - 1` is greater than 0**
