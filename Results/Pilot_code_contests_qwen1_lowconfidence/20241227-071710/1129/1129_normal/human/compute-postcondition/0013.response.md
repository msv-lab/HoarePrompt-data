The code snippet updates the value of `min_2` to be the minimum of its current value and the difference between `a_s[k + 2]` and `a_s[k]`. Given the initial state where `max_1` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `a_s`, `k` is `len(a_s) - 3`, and `min_2` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k]`, the value of `min_2` is now explicitly set to `a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k]`.

Output State: **`max_1` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `a_s`, `k` is `len(a_s) - 3`, and `min_2` is `a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k]`.**
