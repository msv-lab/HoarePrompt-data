The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `s`, which is a string containing `n` space-separated integers `ai`, where `3 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000`, and the sequence `ai` is guaranteed to be strictly increasing. The function splits the string `s` into individual integer strings, converts them to integers, and returns a list of these integers. The function ensures that the input string `s` meets the specified conditions and performs no additional operations beyond converting the string to a list of integers. Potential edge cases include an empty string or a string that does not meet the specified format, although the code itself handles these cases by attempting to split and convert the string, which may raise a `ValueError` if the format is incorrect.
