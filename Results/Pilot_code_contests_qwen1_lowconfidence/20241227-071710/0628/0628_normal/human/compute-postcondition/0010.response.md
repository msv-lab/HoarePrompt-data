`res` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `res` is 2, so after executing `res += 1`, the value of `res` becomes 3. The values of `lower` and `upper` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lower` is an input integer, `upper` is an input integer with \(1 \leq \text{lower} \leq \text{upper} \leq 10^{18}\), `res` is 3**
