According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `val`. The loop will continue if `val` is within the specified range, i.e., `lower` to `upper`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `lower` is an input integer.
- `upper` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{lower} \leq \text{upper} \leq 10^{18}\).
- `res` is 1, meaning that `val` from the previous iteration satisfied the condition \(\text{lower} \leq \text{val} \leq \text{upper}\).

For the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `val` (which is 2 in this case, as it starts from 1 and increments by 1) must also satisfy the condition \(\text{lower} \leq \text{val} \leq \text{upper}\).

Since `val` was within the range in the previous iteration, and the range does not change with each iteration, `val` will still be within the range for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`lower` is an input integer, `upper` is an input integer with \(1 \leq \text{lower} \leq \text{upper} \leq 10^{18}\), `res` is 1**.
