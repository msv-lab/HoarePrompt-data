`res` is incremented by 1. The value of `lower` and `upper` remains unchanged, and `val` is within the range defined by `lower` and `upper`. The updated state is as follows:

Output State: **`lower` is an input integer, `upper` is an input integer with \(1 \leq \text{lower} \leq \text{upper} \leq 10^{18}\), `res` is 1, `val` satisfies the condition \(\text{lower} \leq \text{val} \leq \text{upper}\)**
