Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `smallestpos` is `max(0, (lower - 13) / 10)`
- `length` is 2
- `startend` is 2
- `alreadyval` is 22
- `largestpos` is `min(9, (upper - 22) / 10)`
- `res` is increased by `(largestpos + 1) + max(0, largestpos - smallestpos + 1)`

### For Loop Statement:
```
for startend in range(1, 10):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over the values from 1 to 9 inclusive. This means the loop will continue as long as `startend` is between 1 and 9 (inclusive).

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `startend` is 2.

3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `startend` must be increased by 1 and should still be within the range [1, 9]. Therefore, `startend` will become 3.

4. **Other Variables**: Since no other variables are modified by the loop itself, their values remain the same.

### Updated State:
- `smallestpos` remains `max(0, (lower - 13) / 10)`
- `length` remains 2
- `startend` is now 3
- `alreadyval` remains 22
- `largestpos` remains `min(9, (upper - 22) / 10)`
- `res` remains increased by `(largestpos + 1) + max(0, largestpos - smallestpos + 1)`

### Final Answer:
State: **`smallestpos` is `max(0, (lower - 13) / 10)`, `length` is 2, `startend` is 3, `alreadyval` is 22, `largestpos` is `min(9, (upper - 22) / 10)`, `res` is increased by `(largestpos + 1) + max(0, largestpos - smallestpos + 1)`**
