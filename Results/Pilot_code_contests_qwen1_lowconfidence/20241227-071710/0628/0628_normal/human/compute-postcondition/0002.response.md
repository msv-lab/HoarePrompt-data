According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `val`, which is generated by the `range(1, 10)` function. The loop will iterate from `val = 1` to `val = 9`.

The initial state before the loop is:
- `lower` is an input integer
- `upper` is an input integer, with the constraints \(1 \leq \text{lower} \leq \text{upper} \leq 10^{18}\)
- `res` is 0

Since the loop is iterating over a fixed range from 1 to 9, there's no direct dependency on `lower` or `upper`. The only thing that might need adjustment is ensuring that the loop itself can execute, which it will because the range is fixed and valid.

Therefore, we don't need to adjust any specific values for `lower` or `upper`. The initial state remains as given, and the loop will execute as intended.

State: **`lower` is an input integer, `upper` is an input integer with \(1 \leq \text{lower} \leq \text{upper} \leq 10^{18}\), `res` is 0**
