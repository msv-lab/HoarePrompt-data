The code `lower, upper = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two integers from the standard input, splits them by whitespace, and converts them to integers, assigning them to `lower` and `upper` respectively. This means that `l` and `r` are no longer in the scope and the input values are assigned to `lower` and `upper`.

Output State: **`lower` is an input integer, `upper` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `lower` ≤ `upper` ≤ 10^18**
