Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle single-digit numbers correctly. According to the problem description, single-digit numbers should be counted as they have the first digit equal to the last digit. However, the current implementation only counts numbers with more than one digit. For example, if `l = 5` and `r = 5`, the number 5 should be counted, but the program does not count it. This is a potential case where the program does not work as expected.
