Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the lower bound `lower` is a multi-digit number starting with a specific digit and the upper bound `upper` is just below a power of 10 that would make the last digit of `upper` different from the first digit of `lower`. For example, consider the input:

```
101 109
```

- According to the problem description, the number 101 should be counted because its first and last digits are the same.
- However, the current implementation might miss this case because it only checks for single-digit and multi-digit numbers separately and does not ensure that all numbers within the range are properly evaluated.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that all numbers within the range `[lower, upper]` are checked correctly, especially those spanning multiple digits and close to powers of 10.
