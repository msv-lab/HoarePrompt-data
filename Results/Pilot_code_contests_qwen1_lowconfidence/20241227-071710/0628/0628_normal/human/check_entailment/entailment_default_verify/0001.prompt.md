You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Little Elephant very much loves sums on intervals.

This time he has a pair of integers l and r (l ≤ r). The Little Elephant has to find the number of such integers x (l ≤ x ≤ r), that the first digit of integer x equals the last one (in decimal notation). For example, such numbers as 101, 477474 or 9 will be included in the answer and 47, 253 or 1020 will not.

Help him and count the number of described numbers x for a given pair l and r.

Input

The single line contains a pair of integers l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 1018) — the boundaries of the interval.

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

Output

On a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem.

Examples

Input

2 47


Output

12


Input

47 1024


Output

98

Note

In the first sample the answer includes integers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44. 
Program:
```
func_1()

def func_1():
    (lower, upper) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    res = 0
    for val in range(1, 10):
        if lower <= val <= upper:
            res += 1
    for length in range(2, 19):
        for startend in range(1, 10):
            alreadyval = startend * pow(10, length - 1) + (0 if length == 1 else startend)
            smallestpos = max(0, (lower - alreadyval + 9) / 10)
            largestpos = min(pow(10, length - 2) - 1, (upper - alreadyval) / 10)
            res += max(0, largestpos - smallestpos + 1)
    print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the lower bound `lower` is a multi-digit number starting with a specific digit and the upper bound `upper` is just below a power of 10 that would make the last digit of `upper` different from the first digit of `lower`. For example, consider the input:

```
101 109
```

- According to the problem description, the number 101 should be counted because its first and last digits are the same.
- However, the current implementation might miss this case because it only checks for single-digit and multi-digit numbers separately and does not ensure that all numbers within the range are properly evaluated.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that all numbers within the range `[lower, upper]` are checked correctly, especially those spanning multiple digits and close to powers of 10.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes two input integers, `lower` and `upper`, which represent a range of values. It counts and sums up the number of integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive) that fall within each possible range of numbers from 1 to 10^18. Specifically, for each digit length from 1 to 18, and for each starting digit from 1 to 9, it calculates the number of valid positions where a sequence of digits starting with that digit and of that length could fit within the given range. The function then prints the total count of such valid sequences. Potential edge cases include when the `lower` and `upper` values are at the boundaries of their allowed range (1 to 10^18). The function correctly handles these edge cases by ensuring that the calculations for `smallestpos` and `largestpos` are clamped within valid bounds. However, note that the function does not accept any parameters directly; instead, it reads the `lower` and `upper` values from standard input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
