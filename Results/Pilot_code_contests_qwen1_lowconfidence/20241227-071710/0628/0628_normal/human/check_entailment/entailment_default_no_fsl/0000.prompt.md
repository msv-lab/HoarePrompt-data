You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Little Elephant very much loves sums on intervals.

This time he has a pair of integers l and r (l ≤ r). The Little Elephant has to find the number of such integers x (l ≤ x ≤ r), that the first digit of integer x equals the last one (in decimal notation). For example, such numbers as 101, 477474 or 9 will be included in the answer and 47, 253 or 1020 will not.

Help him and count the number of described numbers x for a given pair l and r.

Input

The single line contains a pair of integers l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 1018) — the boundaries of the interval.

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

Output

On a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem.

Examples

Input

2 47


Output

12


Input

47 1024


Output

98

Note

In the first sample the answer includes integers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44. 
Program:
```
func_1()

def func_1():
    (lower, upper) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    res = 0
    for val in range(1, 10):
        if lower <= val <= upper:
            res += 1
    for length in range(2, 19):
        for startend in range(1, 10):
            alreadyval = startend * pow(10, length - 1) + (0 if length == 1 else startend)
            smallestpos = max(0, (lower - alreadyval + 9) / 10)
            largestpos = min(pow(10, length - 2) - 1, (upper - alreadyval) / 10)
            res += max(0, largestpos - smallestpos + 1)
    print(res)


```
Output hints: The function processes two input integers, `lower` and `upper`, which represent a range of values. It counts and sums up the number of integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive) that fall within each possible range of numbers from 1 to 10^18. Specifically, for each digit length from 1 to 18, and for each starting digit from 1 to 9, it calculates the number of valid positions where a sequence of digits starting with that digit and of that length could fit within the given range. The function then prints the total count of such valid sequences. Potential edge cases include when the `lower` and `upper` values are at the boundaries of their allowed range (1 to 10^18). The function correctly handles these edge cases by ensuring that the calculations for `smallestpos` and `largestpos` are clamped within valid bounds. However, note that the function does not accept any parameters directly; instead, it reads the `lower` and `upper` values from standard input.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
