#State of the program right berfore the function call: A, B, and C are positive integers.
def func_1(A, B, C):
    return 2 * (A + 1) * (B + C + 2) + B * C
    #The program returns 2 * (A + 1) * (B + C + 2) + B * C, where A, B, and C are positive integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three positive integer parameters A, B, and C. It calculates and returns the value of the expression `2 * (A + 1) * (B + C + 2) + B * C`. This expression involves arithmetic operations on the input parameters, specifically adding 1 to A, adding 2 to B + C, multiplying the results, and then adding the product of B and C. The function does not modify any input parameters; it only uses them to compute the final output. Since the function is defined to accept only positive integers, it inherently handles the case where A, B, and C are positive. No additional edge cases need to be considered beyond ensuring the inputs are positive integers, as the operation itself does not introduce any new constraints.
