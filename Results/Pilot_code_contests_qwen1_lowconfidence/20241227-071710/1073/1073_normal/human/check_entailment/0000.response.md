Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum and maximum number of stolen hay blocks for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the edge case where `n` is a prime number correctly.

### Edge Case Analysis:
- **Prime Number Input**: If `n` is a prime number, the program will not find valid values for `A`, `B`, and `C` that satisfy the condition `(A - 1) * (B - 2) * (C - 2) = n`. This is because the program relies on factorization and square root approximations which may miss prime values.

For example, consider the input `n = 7`. In this case, the correct minimum and maximum number of stolen hay blocks should be:
- Minimum: 47 (if the initial arrangement was 5x3x3)
- Maximum: 65 (if the initial arrangement was 7x2x2)

However, the program incorrectly calculates these values and fails to provide the correct results for such inputs.

### Example:
For `n = 7`:
- The program output might be incorrect due to its approach of factorization and approximation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for certain cases, particularly when `n` is a prime number.
