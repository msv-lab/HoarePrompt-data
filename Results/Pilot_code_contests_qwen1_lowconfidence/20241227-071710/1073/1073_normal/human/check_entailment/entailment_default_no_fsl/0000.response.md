Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum and maximum number of hay blocks that could have been stolen. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not used correctly to compute the minimum and maximum values. 

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to compute the number of hay blocks stolen given dimensions \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). However, the way `func_1` is used in the main part of the code is incorrect.
   - The code should use `func_1` to compute the total number of hay blocks before and after the theft and then derive the number of stolen blocks. Instead, it directly uses `func_1` in a way that doesn't reflect the logic required to solve the problem.

2. **Calculation Logic:**
   - The code attempts to find the factors \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) such that \((A-1) \times (B-2) \times (C-2) = n\).
   - The function `func_1` computes the number of blocks before the theft as \(2 \times (A+1) \times (B+C+2) + B \times C\).
   - However, the code incorrectly uses `func_1` to find the minimum and maximum number of stolen blocks without properly accounting for the actual dimensions of the parallelepiped before and after the theft.

3. **Example Case Analysis:**
   - Consider the input \(n = 4\):
     - The correct solution should be \(28\) (minimum) and \(41\) (maximum), as derived from the examples provided.
   - The code, however, does not correctly derive these values. It seems to overestimate the number of stolen blocks by using the formula in an incorrect manner.

To fix the code, the following steps should be taken:
1. Correctly derive the dimensions \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) such that \((A-1) \times (B-2) \times (C-2) = n\).
2. Calculate the total number of blocks before the theft as \(A \times B \times C\).
3. Use the formula \(2 \times (A+1) \times (B+C+2) + B \times C\) to compute the number of blocks before the theft.
4. Derive the number of stolen blocks as the difference between the total number of blocks before and after the theft.

Since the current implementation does not correctly handle the logic and calculation, the code is deemed incorrect.
