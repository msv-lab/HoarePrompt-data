You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Far Far Away lived Sam the Farmer. Sam had a cow named Dawn and he was deeply attached to her. Sam would spend the whole summer stocking hay to feed Dawn in winter. Sam scythed hay and put it into haystack. As Sam was a bright farmer, he tried to make the process of storing hay simpler and more convenient to use. He collected the hay into cubical hay blocks of the same size. Then he stored the blocks in his barn. After a summer spent in hard toil Sam stored A·B·C hay blocks and stored them in a barn as a rectangular parallelepiped A layers high. Each layer had B rows and each row had C blocks.

At the end of the autumn Sam came into the barn to admire one more time the hay he'd been stacking during this hard summer. Unfortunately, Sam was horrified to see that the hay blocks had been carelessly scattered around the barn. The place was a complete mess. As it turned out, thieves had sneaked into the barn. They completely dissembled and took away a layer of blocks from the parallelepiped's front, back, top and sides. As a result, the barn only had a parallelepiped containing (A - 1) × (B - 2) × (C - 2) hay blocks. To hide the evidence of the crime, the thieves had dissembled the parallelepiped into single 1 × 1 × 1 blocks and scattered them around the barn. After the theft Sam counted n hay blocks in the barn but he forgot numbers A, B и C.

Given number n, find the minimally possible and maximally possible number of stolen hay blocks.

Input

The only line contains integer n from the problem's statement (1 ≤ n ≤ 109).

Output

Print space-separated minimum and maximum number of hay blocks that could have been stolen by the thieves.

Note that the answer to the problem can be large enough, so you must use the 64-bit integer type for calculations. Please, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.

Examples

Input

4


Output

28 41


Input

7


Output

47 65


Input

12


Output

48 105

Note

Let's consider the first sample test. If initially Sam has a parallelepiped consisting of 32 = 2 × 4 × 4 hay blocks in his barn, then after the theft the barn has 4 = (2 - 1) × (4 - 2) × (4 - 2) hay blocks left. Thus, the thieves could have stolen 32 - 4 = 28 hay blocks. If Sam initially had a parallelepiped consisting of 45 = 5 × 3 × 3 hay blocks in his barn, then after the theft the barn has 4 = (5 - 1) × (3 - 2) × (3 - 2) hay blocks left. Thus, the thieves could have stolen 45 - 4 = 41 hay blocks. No other variants of the blocks' initial arrangement (that leave Sam with exactly 4 blocks after the theft) can permit the thieves to steal less than 28 or more than 41 blocks.

mx = 8 * n + 9
mn = mx
while r > 0:
    if n % r == 0:
        A = r
        m = n / r
        B = int(math.sqrt(float(m))) + 1
        while B > 0:
            if m % B == 0:
                C = m / B
                mn = min([mn, func_1(A, B, C), func_1(B, A, C), func_1(C, B, A)])
            B -= 1
    r -= 1
print('%d %d' % (mn, mx))

def func_1(A, B, C):
    return 2 * (A + 1) * (B + C + 2) + B * C


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum and maximum number of stolen hay blocks for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the edge case where `n` is a prime number correctly.

### Edge Case Analysis:
- **Prime Number Input**: If `n` is a prime number, the program will not find valid values for `A`, `B`, and `C` that satisfy the condition `(A - 1) * (B - 2) * (C - 2) = n`. This is because the program relies on factorization and square root approximations which may miss prime values.

For example, consider the input `n = 7`. In this case, the correct minimum and maximum number of stolen hay blocks should be:
- Minimum: 47 (if the initial arrangement was 5x3x3)
- Maximum: 65 (if the initial arrangement was 7x2x2)

However, the program incorrectly calculates these values and fails to provide the correct results for such inputs.

### Example:
For `n = 7`:
- The program output might be incorrect due to its approach of factorization and approximation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for certain cases, particularly when `n` is a prime number.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys
import math

n = eval(sys.stdin.readline().strip('\n\r ').split()[0])
if n == 1:
    print('17 17')
    exit(0)
r = int(math.sqrt(float(n))) + 1
r3 = int(10 ** (math.log10(float(n)) / 3)) - 1
mx = 8 * n + 9
mn = mx
while r > 0:
    if n % r == 0:
        A = r
        m = n / r
        B = int(math.sqrt(float(m))) + 1
        while B > 0:
            if m % B == 0:
                C = m / B
                mn = min([mn, func_1(A, B, C), func_1(B, A, C), func_1(C, B, A)])
            B -= 1
    r -= 1
print('%d %d' % (mn, mx))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: A, B, and C are positive integers.
def func_1(A, B, C):
    return 2 * (A + 1) * (B + C + 2) + B * C
    #The program returns 2 * (A + 1) * (B + C + 2) + B * C, where A, B, and C are positive integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three positive integer parameters A, B, and C. It calculates and returns the value of the expression `2 * (A + 1) * (B + C + 2) + B * C`. This expression involves arithmetic operations on the input parameters, specifically adding 1 to A, adding 2 to B + C, multiplying the results, and then adding the product of B and C. The function does not modify any input parameters; it only uses them to compute the final output. Since the function is defined to accept only positive integers, it inherently handles the case where A, B, and C are positive. No additional edge cases need to be considered beyond ensuring the inputs are positive integers, as the operation itself does not introduce any new constraints.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
