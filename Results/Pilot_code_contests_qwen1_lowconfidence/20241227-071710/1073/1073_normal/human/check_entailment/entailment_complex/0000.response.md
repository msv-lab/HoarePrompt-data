Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Problem Description Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the minimum and maximum number of hay blocks that could have been stolen by the thieves given the remaining number of hay blocks \( n \).
   - The stolen hay blocks are calculated based on the formula \( (A-1) \times (B-2) \times (C-2) \).

2. **Program Implementation**:
   - The program reads an integer \( n \) from the standard input.
   - It checks for the base case where \( n = 1 \) and prints the result directly.
   - For other values of \( n \), it iterates over possible values of \( A \) and \( B \) to find \( C \) such that \( A \times B \times C = n \).
   - For each valid triplet \( (A, B, C) \), it calculates the number of stolen blocks using the function `func_1`, which computes \( 2 \times (A+1) \times (B+C+2) + B \times C \).
   - The function `func_1` ensures that the calculation respects the problem constraints and provides the correct number of stolen blocks for each possible configuration.
   - The minimum and maximum values are tracked and printed at the end.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the number of stolen blocks based on the given formula and returns the result.
   - It does not modify any input parameters and only performs arithmetic operations, which are consistent with the problem requirements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( n = 1 \) directly.
   - The main loop and the function `func_1` ensure that all valid configurations of \( (A, B, C) \) are considered, and the calculations are performed correctly.

Since the program correctly follows the steps outlined in the problem description and handles all necessary calculations and edge cases, it is correct.
