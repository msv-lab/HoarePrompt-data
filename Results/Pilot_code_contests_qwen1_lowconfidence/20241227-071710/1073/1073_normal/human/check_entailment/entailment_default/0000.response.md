Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum and maximum number of stolen hay blocks for every potential case. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum and maximum values is flawed.

1. **Minimum Number Calculation**: The program calculates the minimum number of stolen hay blocks using the function `func_1(A, B, C)`, which computes the number of remaining hay blocks after a layer is removed from the front, back, top, and sides. However, the function `func_1` is incorrectly used to find the minimum number of stolen hay blocks. The minimum number of stolen hay blocks should be calculated based on the initial number of hay blocks minus the remaining number of hay blocks after the theft. The program does not correctly handle this calculation.

2. **Maximum Number Calculation**: The maximum number of stolen hay blocks is incorrectly calculated as \(8 \times n + 9\). This formula does not accurately represent the maximum number of hay blocks that could be stolen. The correct maximum number of stolen hay blocks should be derived from the initial configuration of the hay blocks and the dimensions of the parallelepiped.

To illustrate, let's consider an example where \(n = 4\):

- If Sam initially had a parallelepiped consisting of 32 = 2 × 4 × 4 hay blocks, after the theft, the barn has 4 = (2 - 1) × (4 - 2) × (4 - 2) hay blocks left. Thus, the thieves could have stolen 32 - 4 = 28 hay blocks.
- If Sam initially had a parallelepiped consisting of 45 = 5 × 3 × 3 hay blocks, after the theft, the barn has 4 = (5 - 1) × (3 - 2) × (3 - 2) hay blocks left. Thus, the thieves could have stolen 45 - 4 = 41 hay blocks.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum number of stolen hay blocks and the maximum number of stolen hay blocks.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and hence the correctness is **False**.
