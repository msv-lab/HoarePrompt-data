Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program fails to handle the case where `n` is a prime number correctly. Specifically, for `n = 7`, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum and maximum number of stolen hay blocks. The output should be `47 65`, but the program outputs `65 65`. This is due to the fact that the program does not properly explore all possible factorizations of `n` when `n` is a prime number. The logic in the program needs to account for all possible factorizations of `n` to correctly determine the minimum and maximum number of stolen hay blocks. Therefore, the original assessment remains correct.
