Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly calculate the minimum and maximum number of stolen hay blocks for all potential cases, especially when `n` is a prime number. The output hints confirm that the `func_1` function correctly computes the expression \(2 \times (A + 1) \times (B + C + 2) + B \times C\), but the main logic of the program does not account for the edge case where `n` is a prime number. This oversight causes the program to fail in providing the correct results for such inputs, leading to incorrect minimum and maximum values being returned. Therefore, the program needs to handle prime numbers more effectively to ensure it provides accurate results in all cases.
