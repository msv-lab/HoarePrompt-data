The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `A`, `B`, and `C`. `A`, `B`, and `C` are positive integers. After executing the function body, the function returns the value calculated by the formula `2 * (A + 1) * (B + C + 2) + B * C`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three positive integers `A`, `B`, and `C`, and return the value calculated using the formula `2 * (A + 1) * (B + C + 2) + B * C`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters A, B, and C, and returns the value calculated by the formula `2 * (A + 1) * (B + C + 2) + B * C`.**
