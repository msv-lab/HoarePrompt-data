The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `f`. If `f` is provided, it returns a map object containing integers converted from a string of space-separated integers. If `f` is not provided, it returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on spaces. The function reads a string from the input, processes it based on the presence of `f`, and then returns the processed data accordingly. There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code.
