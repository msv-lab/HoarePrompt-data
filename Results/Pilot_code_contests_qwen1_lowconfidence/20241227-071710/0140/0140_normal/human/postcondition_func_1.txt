The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of lines to process, and `f`, a boolean indicating whether to transform the input into tuples or leave them as lists. The function reads `t` lines from a file using the `read()` method, splits each line into space-separated non-negative integers, and either transforms these integers into tuples (if `f` is True) or leaves them as lists (if `f` is False). The function returns a list `result` containing `t` tuples or lists, where each tuple or list corresponds to the processed line read from the file. This list is constructed during the execution of a for loop that iterates `t` times.
