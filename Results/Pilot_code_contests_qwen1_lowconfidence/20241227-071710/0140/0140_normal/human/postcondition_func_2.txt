The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `xs` and an integer `k`. It analyzes the list to determine the number of increasing and decreasing adjacent pairs (`k2` and `k1` respectively). Based on the counts of these pairs, it performs specific actions using the `w()` function to print certain indices or exits the program. If the length of `xs` is less than `k`, it does not perform any specific action related to `k` and instead, the list `xs` remains unchanged. The function does not return anything explicitly, but the state of the program includes modified variables `k2` and `k1` depending on the conditions checked.
