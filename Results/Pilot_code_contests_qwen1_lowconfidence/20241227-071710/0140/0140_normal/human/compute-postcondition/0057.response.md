The code `w('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k)))` prints the absolute values of `(i + 1 + k)` and `(i + 2 + k)`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n-1`, and `k` remains unchanged. The values of `i` and `k` are used in the expressions, but the actual printing of these values does not affect the variables themselves.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `xs` being a list of integers, `i` being `n-1`, and `k` remaining unchanged.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `i` is `n-1`, and `k` remains unchanged.**
