Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `xs` and an integer `k`. It analyzes the list to determine the number of increasing and decreasing adjacent pairs (`k2` and `k1` respectively). Based on the counts of these pairs, it performs specific actions using the `w()` function to print certain indices or exits the program. If the length of `xs` is less than `k`, it does not perform any specific action related to `k` and instead, the list `xs` remains unchanged. The function does not return anything explicitly, but the state of the program includes modified variables `k2` and `k1` depending on the conditions checked.**

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
1. The function does not handle the case where `k` is less than 2. In such a scenario, the function might not behave as expected because the logic is based on the assumption that `k` is at least 2.
2. The function does not check if `k` is greater than the length of `xs`, which could lead to undefined behavior if `k` is larger than `n`.
3. The function does not return anything, which might be misleading given its name suggests it should return a value or modify `k`. The state of the program after execution includes modified `k2` and `k1`, but this is not clearly communicated through the return value or any explicit output.
4. The function does not handle the case where `xs` is empty or contains only one element, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the loops.
