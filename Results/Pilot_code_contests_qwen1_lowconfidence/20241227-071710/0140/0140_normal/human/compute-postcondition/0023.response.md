The code `w('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k)))` prints the absolute values of `(i + 1 + k)` and `(i + 2 + k)`. However, since the value of `k` is not defined in the initial state and there is no assignment or initialization of `k`, the code will still print the expressions without evaluating them further. The initial values of `i` and the conditions related to `n` and `xs` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, and the current value of `xs[i]` is less than the value of `xs[i + 1]; w()` is called with arguments `abs(1 + k)` and `abs(2 + k)`**
