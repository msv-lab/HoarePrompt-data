`k2` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` remains the length of the array and must be at least 2; `k2` is now 3; `k1` remains the same unless `xs[m + 2]` is not greater than `xs[m + 3]`; `i` must be `m + 2` for the loop to execute again.
