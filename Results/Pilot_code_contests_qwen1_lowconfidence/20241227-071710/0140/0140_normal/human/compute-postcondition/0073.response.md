The code `w('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k)))` calculates the absolute values of `i + 1 + k` and `i + 2 + k`, and then prints them using the `w` function. However, the values of the variables do not change due to this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `xs` is a list of integers
- `n` is at least 3
- `k2` is 1
- `k1` is 0
- `i` is `i_end + 2`

The code does not affect the values of `xs`, `n`, `k2`, `k1`, and `i`. Therefore, these values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 3, `k2` is 1, `k1` is 0, and `i` is `i_end + 2`**
