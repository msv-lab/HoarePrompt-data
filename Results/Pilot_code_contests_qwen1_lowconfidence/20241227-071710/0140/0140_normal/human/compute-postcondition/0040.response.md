The code `sys.exit()` is executed, which immediately terminates the program without further execution of the subsequent lines. Since the program exits, no new values are assigned to any variables, and the existing states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list such that `i < len(xs) - 1`, and the current value of `xs[i]` is greater than `xs[i + 1]`, and a string "abs(i + 1 + k) abs(i + 2 + k)" is passed to the function `w()`**
