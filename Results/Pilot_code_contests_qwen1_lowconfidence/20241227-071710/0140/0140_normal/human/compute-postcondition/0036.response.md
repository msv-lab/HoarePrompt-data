Postcondition: ***`xs` is a list of integers, `n` is the length of the list, `k2` is the count of adjacent pairs (xs[i], xs[i+1]) where xs[i] < xs[i+1], and `k1` is the count of adjacent pairs (xs[i], xs[i+1]) where xs[i] > xs[i+1]. `k2` is equal to 1, `k1` is greater than or equal to 1, and the length of `xss` is less than `n`. No changes are made to the variables `i` and `w()` is not called.***
