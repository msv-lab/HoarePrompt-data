Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `xs` is a list of integers.
- `i` is `n-2`.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- If `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]`, the print statement outputs `'%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k))` and the program exits. Otherwise, no change occurs to the program state.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in xrange(0, n - 1, 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `n-2` with a step of `1`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-2`.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the value of `i` at the start of the current iteration.

3. **Next Iteration of the Loop**:
   - The loop increments `i` by `1` at each step.
   - If `i` is currently `n-2`, then the next value of `i` will be `n-1`.

4. **Loop Execution Check**:
   - The loop will run as long as `i` is less than `n-1`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n-2`, the next value `n-1` is still within the bounds of the loop condition (`0` to `n-2`).

5. **No Change to `k`**:
   - `k` remains unchanged throughout the loop iterations.

6. **No Change to `xs`**:
   - There is no modification to the list `xs` within the loop body based on the given information.

### Conclusion:
- `i` will be incremented to `n-1` for the next iteration.
- The condition `i < n-1` will still hold true, allowing the loop to execute one more time.

### Updated State:
- `i` will be `n-1`.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `xs` remains the same.

### Final Answer:
State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `i` is `n-1`, and `k` remains unchanged.**
