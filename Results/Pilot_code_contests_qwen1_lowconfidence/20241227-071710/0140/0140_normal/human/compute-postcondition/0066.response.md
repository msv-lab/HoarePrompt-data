The `sys.exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. As a result, no further code is executed, and the values of the variables are not updated. All preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an index in `xs`, `n` is at least 3, `k2` is 1, `k1` is 0, the element at index `i` in `xs` is less than the element at index `i + 1` in `xs`, and `w` is called with arguments `abs(i + 2)` and `abs(i + 3)`. The program exits.**
