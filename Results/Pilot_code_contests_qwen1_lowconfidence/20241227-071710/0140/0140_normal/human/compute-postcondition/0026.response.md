Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is at least 1
   - The loop body checks if `xs[i]` is less than `xs[i + 1]`. If true, `w()` is called with arguments `abs(1 + k)` and `abs(2 + k)`. Otherwise, no action is taken.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in xrange(0, n - 1, 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-2` (since `xrange(0, n-1)` includes 0 but excludes `n-1`).
   - The loop body checks the condition `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and goes up to `n-2`, `n` must still be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` must still be at least 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2**
