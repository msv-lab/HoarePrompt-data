The code snippet `w('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k)))` uses the `abs` function to compute the absolute values of `i + 1 + k` and `i + 2 + k`, and then prints these values using the `w` function. However, the values of `i` and `k` are not changed by this operation. The `i` is given as `i_end + 1` in the initial state, and `k` is defined as `k1` and `k2`, where `k1` is `0` and `k2` is `1`. Let's substitute these values:

- `i + 1 + k` becomes `(i_end + 1) + 1 + 0` which simplifies to `i_end + 2`.
- `i + 2 + k` becomes `(i_end + 1) + 2 + 0` which simplifies to `i_end + 3`.

The `abs` function applied to both expressions results in `i_end + 2` and `i_end + 3` respectively since `i_end + 2` and `i_end + 3` are already positive.

Therefore, the `w` function will print `i_end + 2` and `i_end + 3`.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 3, `k2` is 1, `k1` is 0, and `i` is `i_end + 1`, and we print `i_end + 2` and `i_end + 3`.**
