Postcondition: ***`xs` is a list of integers, `n` is the length of the list, `k2` is the count of adjacent pairs (xs[i], xs[i+1]) where xs[i] < xs[i+1], and `k1` is the count of adjacent pairs (xs[i], xs[i+1]) where xs[i] > xs[i+1]. If `k2` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is either the index of the first adjacent pair where `xs[i] >= xs[i+1]` or `n - 2`, and `w()` is called if `i` is the index of the first such pair. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
