Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `xs` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is at least 3.
   - `k2` is 1.
   - `k1` is 0.
   - `i` is `i_end + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `n - 2` (inclusive) with a step of `1`.
   - The loop body is omitted but we know the following:
     - If `xs[i]` is less than `xs[i + 1]`, then `i_end + 2` and `i_end + 3` are printed and the program exits.
     - Otherwise, the program simply exits without any changes to the variables' values.

3. **Current State Analysis:**
   - Since `i` is `i_end + 1`, the loop has already reached this point.
   - For the loop to continue executing one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - If `i` is currently `i_end + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `i_end + 2`.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - All other variables (`xs`, `n`, `k2`, `k1`) remain unchanged because the loop body does not modify them.

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `xs` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is at least 3.
   - `k2` is 1.
   - `k1` is 0.
   - `i` is `i_end + 2`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 3, `k2` is 1, `k1` is 0, and `i` is `i_end + 2`.**
