The `sys.exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately without executing any further code. This means that any subsequent changes to variables or outputs are not possible. The values of the variables before the exit call are retained.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 3, `k2` is 1, `k1` is 0, and `i` is `i_end + 1`, and we print `i_end + 2` and `i_end + 3`. The program exits.**
