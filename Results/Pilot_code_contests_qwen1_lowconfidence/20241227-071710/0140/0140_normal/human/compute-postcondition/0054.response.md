The code snippet uses the `w` function to print a formatted string using the `abs` function on the expressions `(i + 1 + k)` and `(i + 2 + k)`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the changes:

- `i` is initially `n-1`.
- `k` remains unchanged.

The expressions inside `abs` are:
- `abs(i + 1 + k) = abs((n-1) + 1 + k) = abs(n + k - 1)`
- `abs(i + 2 + k) = abs((n-1) + 2 + k) = abs(n + k + 1)`

These values are passed to the `w` function, which prints them. However, the values of `xs`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged in the output state.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `i` is `n-1`, and `k` remains unchanged.**
