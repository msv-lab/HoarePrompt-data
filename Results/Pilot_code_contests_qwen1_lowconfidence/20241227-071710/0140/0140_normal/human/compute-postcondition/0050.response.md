The code snippet provided is a call to a function `w` with the argument `('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k)))`. However, since the function `w` is not defined in the provided context, we assume that it prints the given string. Additionally, the condition specified before the code snippet is that if `xs[i] > xs[i + 1]`, the output of the print statement is `('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k)))` and the program exits.

Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `xs` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is `n-2`.
   - `i < len(xs) - 1`.

2. **Code Impact**:
   - The code calls a function `w` which prints the string `('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k)))`.
   - Since the function `w` is assumed to print the string, the print statement will be executed.
   - The values of `i` and `k` will be used to compute `abs(i + 1 + k)` and `abs(i + 2 + k)`.

3. **Calculation**:
   - `i` is `n-2`.
   - `abs(i + 1 + k)` simplifies to `abs(n-1+k)`.
   - `abs(i + 2 + k)` simplifies to `abs(n+k)`.

4. **Output State**:
   - The print statement will output `('%s %s' % (abs(n-1+k), abs(n+k)))`.
   - No changes are made to the list `xs` or the variable `i`.
   - The variable `k` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `i` is `n-2`, `k` is unchanged, and the program outputs `('%s %s' % (abs(n-1+k), abs(n+k)))`.**
