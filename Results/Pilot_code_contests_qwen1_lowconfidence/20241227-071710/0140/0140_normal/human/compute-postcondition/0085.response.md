The code snippet uses the `w` function to print a formatted string. The string format includes `abs(1 + k)` and `abs(i + 1 + k)`. Since `k1` and `k2` are both 0, `k` is assumed to be `k1`. Here are the steps:

1. Calculate `abs(1 + k1)`: Since `k1` is 0, `abs(1 + 0)` equals `1`.
2. Calculate `abs(i + 1 + k1)`: Since `i` is 2 and `k1` is 0, `abs(2 + 1 + 0)` equals `3`.

Therefore, the printed string will be "1 3".

The `w` function itself does not assign any new values to the variables, so the values of `total`, `i`, `n`, `k2`, `k1`, and `i_end` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k2` is 0, `k1` is 0, `i_end` is `n - 2`, the output is "1 3"**
