The code `k2 = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `k2`. This does not affect the values of `xs` or `n`. Therefore, the output state remains with `xs` being a list of integers representing the array, `n` being the length of the array, and `k2` being 0.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers representing the array, `n` is the length of the array, `k2` is 0**
