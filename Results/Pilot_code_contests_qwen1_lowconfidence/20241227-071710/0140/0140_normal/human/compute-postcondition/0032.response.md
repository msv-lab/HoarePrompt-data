The code `sys.exit()` is used to exit the program immediately. This means that no further code will be executed after this line. Therefore, the values of `i` and `n` will remain unchanged, and the function `w` will not be called. The only change is that the program exits.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is at least 2; the program has exited.**
