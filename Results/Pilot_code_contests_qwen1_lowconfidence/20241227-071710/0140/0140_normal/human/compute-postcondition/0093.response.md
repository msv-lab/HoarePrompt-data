Postcondition: ***`xs` is a list of integers, `n` is the length of `xs`, `k2` is 1, `k1` is 0, and `i_end` is `n - 2`. If `k2 == 0`, and during any iteration of the loop, `xs[0] != xs[i]`, then `i` is the index where the condition holds true and the program prints "1 [i+1]". If the loop does not exit early due to `xs[0] != xs[i]`, then `i` is `n - 1` and the program exits without printing anything. No other changes are made to the variables' values or relationships.***
