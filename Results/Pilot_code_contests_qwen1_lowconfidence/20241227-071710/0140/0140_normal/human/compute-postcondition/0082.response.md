The `sys.exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. Since the program exits without further execution, none of the variables are updated or affected by any subsequent code. The output state retains the initial state of the variables.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k2` is 0, `k1` is 0, `i_end` is `n - 2`, the first element of `xs` is not equal to the element at index `i`, and the output is "1 2".**
