The code `sys.exit()` is used to exit the program. This means that no further operations will be performed after this line, and the program will terminate. Since the program terminates, the values of the variables `xs`, `i`, and the condition checks are not affected by any subsequent code. The only thing that happens is the program exits.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `i` is `n-2`, `i < len(xs) - 1`, `xs[i]` is not less than `xs[i + 1]`, the output of the print statement is `'%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k))`, the program exits.**
