The code `sys.exit()` is used to exit the program abruptly, which means that no further code will be executed after this statement. Therefore, none of the variables will be updated or affected by any further operations. The only information that remains from the initial state is the values of the variables before the function call.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 3, `k2` is 1, `k1` is 0, and `i` is `i_end + 2`. The program exits.**
