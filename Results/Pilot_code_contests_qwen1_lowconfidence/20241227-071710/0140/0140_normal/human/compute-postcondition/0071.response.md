Postcondition: ***`xs` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 3, `k2` is 1, `k1` is 0, and `i` is `i_end + 1`. If `xs[i]` is less than `xs[i + 1]`, then `i_end + 2` and `i_end + 3` are printed and the program exits. Otherwise, the program simply exits without any changes to the variables' values.***
