Postcondition: ***`xs` is a list of integers, `n` is the length of the list, `k2` is the count of adjacent pairs (xs[i], xs[i+1]) where xs[i] < xs[i+1], and `k1` is the count of adjacent pairs (xs[i], xs[i+1]) where xs[i] > xs[i+1]. If `k2` is equal to 1 and `k1` is greater than or equal to 1 and the length of `xs` is less than `n`, then `i` is `n - 1`, `k` remains unchanged, `k2` is equal to 1, and `k1` is greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
