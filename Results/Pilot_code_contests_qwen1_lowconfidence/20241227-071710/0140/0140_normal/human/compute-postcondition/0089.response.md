The code `w('%s %s' % (abs(1 + k1), abs(i + 1 + k2)))` does not affect the variables `total`, `i`, `n`, `k1`, and `k2`. Instead, it prints the values of the expressions `abs(1 + k1)` and `abs(i + 1 + k2)`. Since `k1` is 0 and `k2` is 0, and `i` is 3, the expressions simplify to `abs(1 + 0)` and `abs(3 + 1 + 0)`, which are 1 and 4 respectively. However, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k2` is 0, `k1` is 0, `i_end` is `n - 2`**
