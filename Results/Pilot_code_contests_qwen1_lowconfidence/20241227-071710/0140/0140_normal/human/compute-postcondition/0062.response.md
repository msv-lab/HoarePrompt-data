Postcondition: ***`xs` is a list of integers, `n` is the length of the list, `k2` is the count of adjacent pairs (xs[i], xs[i+1]) where xs[i] < xs[i+1], and `k1` is the count of adjacent pairs (xs[i], xs[i+1]) where xs[i] > xs[i+1]. If `k2` is equal to 1 and `k1` is 0 and the length of `xs` is greater than or equal to 3, then no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
