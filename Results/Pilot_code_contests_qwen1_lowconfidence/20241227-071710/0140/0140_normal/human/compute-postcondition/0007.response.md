`k1` is incremented by 1, so the value of `k1` becomes `k1 + 1`. The states of the other variables (`xs`, `n`, `k2`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `xs` is a list of integers, `n` is the length of the array that must be at least 2, `k2` is 1, and `k1` is `k1 + 1`.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `n` is the length of the array that must be at least 2, `k2` is 1, and `k1` is `k1 + 1`.**
