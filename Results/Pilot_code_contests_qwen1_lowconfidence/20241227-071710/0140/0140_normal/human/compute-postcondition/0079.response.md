To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `xs` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the length of `xs`.
- `k2` is 0.
- `k1` is 0.
- `i_end` is `n - 2`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in xrange(0, n - 1, 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n - 1` (inclusive).
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be initialized to 0.

2. **List `xs`:**
   - Since the loop body checks if `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]`, `xs` must contain at least 2 elements to ensure there is at least one pair `(i, i+1)` to compare.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `k2` and `k1` being 0 does not affect the loop execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.
   - `i_end` is `n - 2`, and since `i_end` remains unchanged within the loop, it does not need to be adjusted either.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 0 and `n` is at least 2.

### Final State:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k2` is 0, `k1` is 0, and `i_end` is `n - 2`.**

Note: The initial value of `total` is mentioned but does not affect the loop execution, so it is included for completeness but not strictly necessary for ensuring the loop starts.
