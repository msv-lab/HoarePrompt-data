The code snippet uses the `w` function to print a formatted string. The string to be printed is `'%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k))`. Since the code itself does not change the values of `i`, `k`, or `xs`, the only impact is the execution of the print statement.

Given the initial state:
- `xs` is a list of integers.
- `i` is `n-2`.
- `i < len(xs) - 1`.
- `xs[i]` is not less than `xs[i + 1]`.

The output of the print statement will be two absolute values of expressions involving `i` and `k`. However, since `k` is not defined in the initial state and its value is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of these expressions. But we can express them in terms of `i` and `k`.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `i` is `n-2`, `i < len(xs) - 1`, `xs[i]` is not less than `xs[i + 1]`, the output of the print statement is `'%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k))`.**
