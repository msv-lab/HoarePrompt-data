The code `sys.exit()` is used to exit the program immediately without executing any further code. This means that the lines of code following this statement are not executed, and therefore, the variables `w` and `i` are not affected.

The output state remains the same as the initial state because no new assignments or operations are performed on the variables.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list such that `i < len(xs) - 1`, and we exit the program.**
