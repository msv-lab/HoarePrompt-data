Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2
   - `k2` is 0
   - `k1` is 0
   - `i_end` is `n - 2`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n - 1` with a step of 1.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Condition for Continuing the Loop:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

5. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` was 2, the next value of `i` would be 3 if the loop continues.

6. **Condition for Terminating the Loop:**
   - The loop terminates if `xs[0] != xs[i]` and the output is "1 3". However, since there is no `else` part, the program state remains unchanged under this condition unless the condition is met, which it hasn't yet based on the given information.

7. **Other Variables:**
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `k2` remains 0.
   - `k1` remains 0.
   - `i_end` remains `n - 2`.

Given the above points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i` to 3.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k2` is 0, `k1` is 0, `i_end` is `n - 2`**
