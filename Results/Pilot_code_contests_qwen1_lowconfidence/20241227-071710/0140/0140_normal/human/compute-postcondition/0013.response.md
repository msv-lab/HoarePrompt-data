Postcondition: ***`xs` is a list of integers, `n` is the length of the array that must be at least 2, `k2` is 2, `k1` is incremented by 1 if `xs[i]` is not greater than `xs[i + 1]`, otherwise it remains the original value, and `i` is `m + 1`. If `xs[i]` is greater than `xs[i + 1]`, `k1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k2` remains 2.***
