The `sys.exit()` function is used to exit the program immediately. This means that no further code in the current scope will be executed, and all variables will retain their last known values before the function call. The states of the variables are not changed by this function. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k2` is 0, `k1` is 0, `i_end` is `n - 2`**
