The code snippet uses the `w` function to print a formatted string using `abs(1 + k)` and `abs(i + 1 + k)`. The values of `i` and `k` are not directly modified by this code, but the function call will use their current values.

Given the initial state:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2
- `k2` is 0
- `k1` is 0
- `i_end` is `n - 2`
- The first element of `xs` is not equal to the element at index `i` (which is now 1)

Since the code does not directly modify `i` or `k`, their values remain unchanged. The `w` function will print the absolute values of `1 + k` and `i + 1 + k`.

Let's evaluate these expressions:
- `1 + k` is `1 + 0` (since `k` is 0), which is 1. The absolute value of 1 is 1.
- `i + 1 + k` is `1 + 1 + 0` (since `i` is 1 and `k` is 0), which is 2. The absolute value of 2 is 2.

Thus, the `w` function will print "1 2".

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k2` is 0, `k1` is 0, `i_end` is `n - 2`, the first element of `xs` is not equal to the element at index `i` (which is now 1), and the output is "1 2".**
