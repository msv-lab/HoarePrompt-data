Postcondition: ***`xs` is a list of integers, `n` is the length of `xs`, `k2` is 1, `k1` is 0, and `i_end` is `n - 2`. If during any iteration of the loop, `xs[i]` is less than `xs[i + 1]`, then `w` is called with arguments `abs(i + 2 + k)` and `abs(i + 3 + k)`, and the program exits. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables' values or relationships, and `i_end` will remain as `n - 2`.***
