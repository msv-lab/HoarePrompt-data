Postcondition: ***`xs` remains a list of integers, `n` remains the length of the array and must be at least 2, `k2` is 3, `k1` remains the same unless `xs[m + 2]` is not greater than `xs[m + 3]`, and `i` must be `m + 2` for the loop to execute again. If `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]`, then `k1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition does not affect the state since there is no action specified in the else part.***
