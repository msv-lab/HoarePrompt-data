The code `k1 += 1` increments the value of `k1` by 1. According to the initial state, `k1` is incremented by 1 if `xs[m]` is not greater than `xs[m + 1]`, otherwise it remains 1. Since the code simply increments `k1` by 1, the new value of `k1` will be the value it had before plus 1. The other variables (`xs`, `n`, `k2`, `i`, `m`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `n` is the length of the array that must be at least 2, `k2` is 2, `k1` is the original value of `k1` + 1, `i` is `m + 1`.**
