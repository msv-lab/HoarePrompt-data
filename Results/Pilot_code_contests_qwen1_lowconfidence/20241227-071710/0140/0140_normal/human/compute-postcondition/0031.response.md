The code `w('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k)))` involves calling a function `w` with a formatted string. However, the variable `k` is not defined in the initial state or within the given code snippet. Since `k` is undefined, we cannot determine the exact values of the expressions `abs(i + 1 + k)` and `abs(i + 2 + k)`. But we can represent them in terms of `k`.

Given the initial state where `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 2, the code will evaluate the absolute values of `i + 1 + k` and `i + 2 + k` and pass these values to the function `w` as a formatted string.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is at least 2; the function `w` is called with the arguments `abs(3 + k)` and `abs(4 + k)`**
