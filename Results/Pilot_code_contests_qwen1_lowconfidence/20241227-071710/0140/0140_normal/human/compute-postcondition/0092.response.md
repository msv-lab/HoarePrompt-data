Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to determine the final state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `xs` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the length of `xs`.
- `k2` is 0.
- `k1` is 0.
- `i_end` is `n - 2`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(0, n - 1, 1):
    if xs[0] != xs[i]:
        w('%s %s' % (abs(1 + k), abs(i + 1 + k)))
        sys.exit()
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.
   - For each `i`, the loop checks if `xs[0]` is not equal to `xs[i]`.
   - If `xs[0] != xs[i]` holds true, it calls the function `w` with arguments `abs(1 + k)` and `abs(i + 1 + k)`, and then exits the program.

2. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If the loop completes without finding any `i` such that `xs[0] != xs[i]`, the loop will terminate normally when `i` reaches `n - 2`.
   - If the loop finds an `i` such that `xs[0] != xs[i]`, it will call `w` and exit the program immediately.

### Final State After All Iterations:
- **Case 1: The loop completes normally (no `xs[0] != xs[i]` found)**:
  - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.
  - Since no condition is met, the loop ends, and all variables retain their original values.
  - `i` will be `n - 1` because the loop increments `i` until `i` is `n - 2`.
  - `total` is still 0.
  - `k2` is still 0.
  - `k1` is still 0.
  - `i_end` is still `n - 2`.

- **Case 2: The loop exits early due to `xs[0] != xs[i]`**:
  - The loop runs until it finds an `i` such that `xs[0] != xs[i]`.
  - The specific value of `i` depends on the condition `xs[0] != xs[i]` being true.
  - The loop calls `w` with `abs(1 + k)` and `abs(i + 1 + k)` and then exits.
  - The exact values of `i` and the printed values depend on the specific indices where the condition is true.
  - All other variables (`total`, `k2`, `k1`, `i_end`) remain unchanged from their original values.

### Output State:
Considering both cases, the most general and encompassing output state is:

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is either `n - 1` or a value where `xs[0] != xs[i]`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k2` is 0, `k1` is 0, `i_end` is `n - 2`. If the loop exits early due to `xs[0] != xs[i]`, `i` is the index where the condition holds true and the program prints "1 [i+1]" where `[i+1]` is the corresponding index value. Otherwise, `i` is `n - 1` and the program exits without printing anything.**
