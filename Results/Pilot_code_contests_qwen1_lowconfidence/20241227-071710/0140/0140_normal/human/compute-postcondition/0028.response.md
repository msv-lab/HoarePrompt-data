The code `sys.exit()` causes the program to exit immediately without further execution of the subsequent code. This means that any changes to variables after this line would not occur. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2, these values remain unchanged because the exit occurs before any modification to these variables.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2**
