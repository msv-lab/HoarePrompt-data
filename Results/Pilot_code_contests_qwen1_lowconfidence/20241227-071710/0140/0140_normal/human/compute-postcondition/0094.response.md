The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `xs`, which is a list of integers, and `k`, which represents the length of the array `xs` such that `1 <= k <= 10^5`. 

Case_1: If the length of the array `xs` (i.e., `k`) is less than the length of the list `xs`, the function returns the list `xs`.

Case_2: If the length of the array `xs` (i.e., `k`) is equal to the length of the list `xs`, the function returns the sum of all elements in the list `xs`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a list of integers `xs` and an integer `k` representing the length of the list `xs`. If the length of `xs` is less than `k`, it returns the list `xs`. If the length of `xs` is equal to `k`, it returns the sum of all elements in the list `xs`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `xs` and an integer `k`. If the length of `xs` is less than `k`, it returns the list `xs`. If the length of `xs` is equal to `k`, it returns the sum of all elements in the list `xs`.**
