The code `sys.exit()` causes the program to exit immediately without further execution of any subsequent statements. This means that no variables will be updated or reassigned. The only variables mentioned in the initial state are `xs`, `i`, and `k`. Since the program exits, these variables retain their original values from the initial state.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `i` is `n-1`, and `k` remains unchanged.**
