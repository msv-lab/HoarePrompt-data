The `sys.exit()` function is called, which immediately terminates the program and does not allow any further execution of the code. As a result, no variables are updated or affected by the code.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k2` is 0, `k1` is 0, `i_end` is `n - 2`, the output is "1 3", the program terminates.**
