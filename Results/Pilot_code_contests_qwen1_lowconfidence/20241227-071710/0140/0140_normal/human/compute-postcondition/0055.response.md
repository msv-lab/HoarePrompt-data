The code `sys.exit()` is used to exit the program immediately. This means that no further operations in the current execution environment will take place, and any changes to variables will not be realized. As a result, the variables `xs`, `i`, and `k` remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `i` is `n-1`, and `k` remains unchanged.**
