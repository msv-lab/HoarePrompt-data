`k1` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `n` and `k2` remains unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `xs` is a list of integers representing the array, `n` is the length of the array, `k2` is 0, and `k1` is 0.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers representing the array, `n` is the length of the array, `k2` is 0, `k1` is 0**
