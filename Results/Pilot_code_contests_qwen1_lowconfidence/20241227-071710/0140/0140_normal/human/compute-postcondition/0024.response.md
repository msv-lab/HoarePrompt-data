The code `sys.exit()` is used to terminate the program immediately. This means that no further code in the current context will be executed, and all the changes made during the execution of the code snippet will not be considered in the final output state.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `n` must be at least 1
- The current value of `xs[i]` is less than the value of `xs[i + 1]`
- `w()` is called with arguments `abs(1 + k)` and `abs(2 + k)`

Since the program terminates before these values can be altered, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, and the current value of `xs[i]` is less than the value of `xs[i + 1]`, `w()` is called with arguments `abs(1 + k)` and `abs(2 + k)`. The program exits.**
