The code `w('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k)))` does the following:

1. It calculates the value of `abs(i + 1 + k)`, which is the absolute value of `i + 1 + k`.
2. It calculates the value of `abs(i + 2 + k)`, which is the absolute value of `i + 2 + k`.
3. It formats these two values into a string using the `%` operator, resulting in a string in the format "abs(i + 1 + k) abs(i + 2 + k)".
4. The formatted string is passed to the function `w()`, but since `w()` is not defined, it doesn't affect the state of the variables.

The values of `i` and `k` are not explicitly modified by this code, and the values of `xs` remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the only variables that could have been affected are `i` and `k`, but since they are not modified, their states remain the same.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list such that `i < len(xs) - 1`, and the current value of `xs[i]` is greater than `xs[i + 1]`, and a string "abs(i + 1 + k) abs(i + 2 + k)" is passed to the function `w()`**
