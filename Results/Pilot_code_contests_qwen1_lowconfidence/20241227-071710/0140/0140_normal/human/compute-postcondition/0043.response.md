The code `w('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k)))` does not modify the list `xs` or the index `i`. Instead, it prints the absolute values of `i + 1 + k` and `i + 2 + k`. Since the values of `i` and `k` are not specified, we cannot determine their exact absolute values. However, the initial conditions remain valid.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list such that `i < len(xs) - 1`; the value of `w` is set to print the absolute values of `i + 1 + k` and `i + 2 + k`.**
