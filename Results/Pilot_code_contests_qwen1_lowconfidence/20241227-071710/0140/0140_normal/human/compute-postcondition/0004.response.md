The code `k2 += 1` increments the value of `k2` by 1. Since `k2` was initially 0, it will now be 1. The other variables (`xs`, `n`, `k1`, and the condition) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers representing the array, `n` is the length of the array that must be at least 2, `k2` is 1, `k1` is 0, and the condition `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]` is true for some index `i` where `0 <= i < n - 1`.**
