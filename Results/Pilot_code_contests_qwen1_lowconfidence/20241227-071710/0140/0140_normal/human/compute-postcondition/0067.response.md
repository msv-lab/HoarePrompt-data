Postcondition: ***`xs` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 3, `k2` is 1, and `k1` is 0. If the element at index `i` in `xs` is less than the element at index `i + 1` in `xs`, then `w` is called with arguments `abs(i + 2)` and `abs(i + 3)`. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.***
