Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is at least 2
   - The condition `xs[1] < xs[2]` determines whether the function call `w(abs(1 + k), abs(2 + k))` is made.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Current Iteration**: At the end of the current iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

4. **Next Iteration**: To enter the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs).

5. **Loop Execution**: Since `i` is currently 1 and `n` is at least 2, `i < n - 1` holds true (because `1 < 2 - 1` simplifies to `1 < 1`, but since `n` is at least 2, it means `n - 1` is at least 1, making the condition true). Thus, the loop can continue.

6. **State Adjustment**: After the next increment, `i` will be 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged because the problem does not indicate any change in `n` during the loop.

7. **Conclusion**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 2 and `n` must still be at least 2.

**Final State**:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is at least 2

So, the adjusted state is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 2**
