Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Function Definitions**:
   - The function definitions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are not used in the main logic. The main logic directly uses `read`, `w`, `sys.exit`, and other functions, bypassing the defined functions. This is inconsistent with the given annotations and leads to confusion about the intended behavior.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The logic to check if the array can be made unsorted by swapping two distinct elements is flawed.
   - The code assumes that the array needs to be checked for both increasing and decreasing order conditions and then tries to find positions where swapping can disrupt the order.
   - However, the implementation does not correctly identify the positions to swap for the given conditions.

3. **Handling of Array Conditions**:
   - The code attempts to check the counts of adjacent pairs (`k2` and `k1`) to determine if the array can be made unsorted. However, the logic for identifying the correct positions to swap is not robust.
   - For instance, the logic in `func_3` does not correctly identify positions where a swap would disrupt the sorted order. It checks for adjacent pairs but does not ensure that the swap results in an unsorted array.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as arrays with all elements being the same, arrays of length 1 or 2, or arrays where the only change needed is a swap between identical elements.
   - For example, the code should handle the case where all elements are the same (output should be `-1`) and should also handle cases where the array already meets the unsorted condition (should output appropriate positions).

5. **General Approach**:
   - The general approach to finding the positions to swap is not correct. The program should identify the first position where the order changes and attempt to swap with the next position to see if it results in an unsorted array.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
