You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Petya likes arrays of integers a lot. Recently his mother has presented him one such array consisting of n elements. Petya is now wondering whether he can swap any two distinct integers in the array so that the array got unsorted. Please note that Petya can not swap equal integers even if they are in distinct positions in the array. Also note that Petya must swap some two integers even if the original array meets all requirements.

Array a (the array elements are indexed from 1) consisting of n elements is called sorted if it meets at least one of the following two conditions:

  1. a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ an; 
  2. a1 ≥ a2 ≥ ... ≥ an. 



Help Petya find the two required positions to swap or else say that they do not exist.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The second line contains n non-negative space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an — the elements of the array that Petya's mother presented him. All integers in the input do not exceed 109.

Output

If there is a pair of positions that make the array unsorted if swapped, then print the numbers of these positions separated by a space. If there are several pairs of positions, print any of them. If such pair does not exist, print -1. The positions in the array are numbered with integers from 1 to n.

Examples

Input

1
1


Output

-1


Input

2
1 2


Output

-1


Input

4
1 2 3 4


Output

1 2


Input

3
1 1 1


Output

-1

Note

In the first two samples the required pairs obviously don't exist.

In the third sample you can swap the first two elements. After that the array will look like this: 2 1 3 4. This array is unsorted.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: read() returns a string containing space-separated integers, and f is a function that converts strings to integers (if provided).
def func_1(f):
    if f :
        return map(f, read().split())
        #`The program returns a map object containing integers converted from a string of space-separated integers`
    else :
        return read().split()
        #`The program returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on spaces`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `f`. If `f` is provided, it returns a map object containing integers converted from a string of space-separated integers. If `f` is not provided, it returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on spaces. The function reads a string from the input, processes it based on the presence of `f`, and then returns the processed data accordingly. There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of lines to read, and each line is a space-separated list of non-negative integers. The function `read()` returns a string containing the content of the current line.
def func_2(t, f):
    result = []
    result_append = result.append
    for i in xrange(t):
        if f:

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `t - 1`, `result` is a list. If the condition `f` is True, then `result` contains `t` tuples where each tuple is a transformation of the space-separated non-negative integers from each line read by `read()`. If the condition `f` is False, then `result` contains `t` lists where each list is the space-separated non-negative integers from each line read by `read()`
    return result
    #`The program returns a list 'result' containing 't' tuples or lists, depending on the value of 'f'. Each tuple or list corresponds to the space-separated non-negative integers from each line read by 'read()'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of lines to process, and `f`, a boolean indicating whether to transform the input into tuples or leave them as lists. The function reads `t` lines from a file using the `read()` method, splits each line into space-separated non-negative integers, and either transforms these integers into tuples (if `f` is True) or leaves them as lists (if `f` is False). The function returns a list `result` containing `t` tuples or lists, where each tuple or list corresponds to the processed line read from the file. This list is constructed during the execution of a for loop that iterates `t` times.

If the loop exits early due to `xs[0] != xs[i]`, `i` is the index where the condition holds true and the program prints "1 [i+1]" where `[i+1]` is the corresponding index value.

If the loop does not exit early due to `xs[0] != xs[i]`, then `i` is `n - 1` and the program exits without printing anything. No other changes are made to the variables' values or relationships.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `xs` and an integer `k`. It analyzes the list to determine the number of increasing and decreasing adjacent pairs (`k2` and `k1` respectively). Based on the counts of these pairs, it performs specific actions using the `w()` function to print certain indices or exits the program. If the length of `xs` is less than `k`, it does not perform any specific action related to `k` and instead, the list `xs` remains unchanged. The function does not return anything explicitly, but the state of the program includes modified variables `k2` and `k1` depending on the conditions checked.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
