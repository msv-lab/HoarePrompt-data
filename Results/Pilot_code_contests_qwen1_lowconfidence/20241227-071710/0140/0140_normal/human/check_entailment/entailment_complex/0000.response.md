Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the array has exactly two distinct elements, and both elements appear only once in the array. According to the problem description, if the array has more than two distinct elements, or if there are exactly two distinct elements and one of them appears more than once, Petya can always find two positions to swap to make the array unsorted. However, the code incorrectly exits with -1 in such cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 2 1 2
```

According to the problem description, Petya can swap the first and third elements or the second and fourth elements to make the array unsorted. However, the code will exit with -1, which is incorrect.

Similarly, for the input:
```
3
1 2 1
```

Petya can swap the first and third elements to make the array unsorted, but the code will exit with -1, which is incorrect.

Thus, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
