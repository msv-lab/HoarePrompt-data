You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Petya likes arrays of integers a lot. Recently his mother has presented him one such array consisting of n elements. Petya is now wondering whether he can swap any two distinct integers in the array so that the array got unsorted. Please note that Petya can not swap equal integers even if they are in distinct positions in the array. Also note that Petya must swap some two integers even if the original array meets all requirements.

Array a (the array elements are indexed from 1) consisting of n elements is called sorted if it meets at least one of the following two conditions:

  1. a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ an; 
  2. a1 ≥ a2 ≥ ... ≥ an. 



Help Petya find the two required positions to swap or else say that they do not exist.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The second line contains n non-negative space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an — the elements of the array that Petya's mother presented him. All integers in the input do not exceed 109.

Output

If there is a pair of positions that make the array unsorted if swapped, then print the numbers of these positions separated by a space. If there are several pairs of positions, print any of them. If such pair does not exist, print -1. The positions in the array are numbered with integers from 1 to n.

Examples

Input

1
1


Output

-1


Input

2
1 2


Output

-1


Input

4
1 2 3 4


Output

1 2


Input

3
1 1 1


Output

-1

Note

In the first two samples the required pairs obviously don't exist.

In the third sample you can swap the first two elements. After that the array will look like this: 2 1 3 4. This array is unsorted.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not account for the scenario where the array is already sorted in a strict increasing or decreasing order. Let's consider an example where the array is sorted in a strict increasing order:

**Input:**
```
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 2
```

However, the program does not produce the expected output. It checks for multiple conditions but fails to handle the case where the array is strictly increasing or decreasing.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the array is already sorted in a strict increasing or decreasing order and handle that case appropriately by returning `-1`.

Here is an improved version of the `func_3` function that handles all edge cases:

```python
def func_3(xs):
    n = len(xs)
    
    # Check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order
    is_non_decreasing = all(xs[i] <= xs[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1))
    
    # Check if the array is already sorted in non-increasing order
    is_non_increasing = all(xs[i] >= xs[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1))
    
    if is_non_decreasing or is_non_increasing:
        return -1
    
    # Find the first position where the order breaks
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if xs[i] > xs[i + 1]:
            return i + 1, i + 2
    return -1

# Example usage
n = int(input())
xs = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(func_3(xs))
```

This updated version correctly identifies that the array is already sorted and returns `-1` in such cases, ensuring the program works as expected for all inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `xs` and an integer `k`. It analyzes the list to determine the number of increasing and decreasing adjacent pairs (`k2` and `k1` respectively). Based on the counts of these pairs, it performs specific actions using the `w()` function to print certain indices or exits the program. If the length of `xs` is less than `k`, it does not perform any specific action related to `k` and instead, the list `xs` remains unchanged. The function does not return anything explicitly, but the state of the program includes modified variables `k2` and `k1` depending on the conditions checked.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
