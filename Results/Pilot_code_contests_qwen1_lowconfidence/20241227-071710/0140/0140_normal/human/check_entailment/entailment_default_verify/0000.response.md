Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the array is already sorted in a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order without any adjacent elements being equal. According to the problem description, if the array is already sorted in such a manner, the program should return `-1`. However, the current implementation of `func_3` does not account for this case. The provided output hints also indicate that the function performs actions based on the counts of increasing and decreasing adjacent pairs but does not explicitly handle the edge case where the array is already sorted in a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order. Therefore, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
