Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not account for the scenario where the array is already sorted in a strict increasing or decreasing order. According to the problem description, Petya needs to determine if he can swap any two distinct integers in the array to make it unsorted. The current implementation does not correctly identify this situation and may produce incorrect outputs for certain inputs. The output hints also confirm that the function does not properly handle the cases where the array is already sorted in a non-decreasing or non-increasing manner. Therefore, the program needs to be revised to correctly handle these edge cases, as shown in the improved version of `func_3` provided above.
