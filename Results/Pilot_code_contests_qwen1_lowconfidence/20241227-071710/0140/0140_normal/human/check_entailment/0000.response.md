Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array is already sorted in a way that no two elements can be swapped to make it unsorted. Specifically, the program checks for increasing and decreasing sequences but does not handle the case where the array is already sorted in a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order without any adjacent elements being equal.

For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]` which is strictly increasing. The program does not identify that swapping any two elements would make it unsorted. However, the problem statement requires finding a pair of positions to swap so that the array becomes unsorted, and for this specific case, any swap would satisfy the condition.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the array is already sorted in a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order without any adjacent elements being equal. If such a condition is met, the program should return `-1`. Here is a modified version of the function that addresses this issue:

```python
def func_3(xs, k):
    n = len(xs)
    inc = dec = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        if xs[i] > xs[i - 1]:
            inc += 1
        elif xs[i] < xs[i - 1]:
            dec += 1
    
    if inc == 0 or dec == 0:
        # The array is already sorted in a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order.
        print(-1)
        return
    
    # Find a position to swap
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if xs[i] < xs[i + 1]:
            print(i + 1, i + 2)
            return
        elif xs[i] > xs[i + 1]:
            print(i + 1, i + 2)
            return

    print(-1)
```

This modified version correctly handles the edge case where the array is already sorted in a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order.
