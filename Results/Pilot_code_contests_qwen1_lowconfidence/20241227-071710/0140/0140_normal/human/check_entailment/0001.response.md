Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not account for the scenario where the array is already sorted in a strict increasing or decreasing order. Let's consider an example where the array is sorted in a strict increasing order:

**Input:**
```
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 2
```

However, the program does not produce the expected output. It checks for multiple conditions but fails to handle the case where the array is strictly increasing or decreasing.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the array is already sorted in a strict increasing or decreasing order and handle that case appropriately by returning `-1`.

Here is an improved version of the `func_3` function that handles all edge cases:

```python
def func_3(xs):
    n = len(xs)
    
    # Check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order
    is_non_decreasing = all(xs[i] <= xs[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1))
    
    # Check if the array is already sorted in non-increasing order
    is_non_increasing = all(xs[i] >= xs[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1))
    
    if is_non_decreasing or is_non_increasing:
        return -1
    
    # Find the first position where the order breaks
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if xs[i] > xs[i + 1]:
            return i + 1, i + 2
    return -1

# Example usage
n = int(input())
xs = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(func_3(xs))
```

This updated version correctly identifies that the array is already sorted and returns `-1` in such cases, ensuring the program works as expected for all inputs.
