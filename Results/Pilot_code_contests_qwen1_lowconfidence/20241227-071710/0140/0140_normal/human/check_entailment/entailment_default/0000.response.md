Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly identify the positions to swap to make the array unsorted for every potential case. Let's break down the issue:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function reads the input and returns it as a list of integers or a list of strings, depending on whether a transformation function `f` is provided. This part is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Function `func_3`**: This function checks the sorted condition of the array and tries to find a pair of positions to swap. However, the logic in `func_3` is flawed. Specifically:
   - The function checks for increasing and decreasing adjacent pairs but does not cover all possible scenarios where swapping two elements can make the array unsorted.
   - The function does not correctly handle cases where the array is already sorted in a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the function will exit without finding any positions to swap, even though swapping any two elements would make the array unsorted.
   - The function does not handle all possible edge cases, such as arrays with duplicate elements in a way that allows them to become unsorted after a swap.

Here is an example where the code fails:
```python
Input: 4
1 2 3 4
```
The function will output `-1` because it does not correctly identify that swapping any two elements in this array will make it unsorted. The correct output should be `1 2` or any other pair of positions that make the array unsorted.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for every potential case and thus the correctness is **False**.
