You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Petya likes arrays of integers a lot. Recently his mother has presented him one such array consisting of n elements. Petya is now wondering whether he can swap any two distinct integers in the array so that the array got unsorted. Please note that Petya can not swap equal integers even if they are in distinct positions in the array. Also note that Petya must swap some two integers even if the original array meets all requirements.

Array a (the array elements are indexed from 1) consisting of n elements is called sorted if it meets at least one of the following two conditions:

  1. a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ an; 
  2. a1 ≥ a2 ≥ ... ≥ an. 



Help Petya find the two required positions to swap or else say that they do not exist.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The second line contains n non-negative space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an — the elements of the array that Petya's mother presented him. All integers in the input do not exceed 109.

Output

If there is a pair of positions that make the array unsorted if swapped, then print the numbers of these positions separated by a space. If there are several pairs of positions, print any of them. If such pair does not exist, print -1. The positions in the array are numbered with integers from 1 to n.

Examples

Input

1
1


Output

-1


Input

2
1 2


Output

-1


Input

4
1 2 3 4


Output

1 2


Input

3
1 1 1


Output

-1

Note

In the first two samples the required pairs obviously don't exist.

In the third sample you can swap the first two elements. After that the array will look like this: 2 1 3 4. This array is unsorted.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array is already sorted in a way that no two elements can be swapped to make it unsorted. Specifically, the program checks for increasing and decreasing sequences but does not handle the case where the array is already sorted in a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order without any adjacent elements being equal.

For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]` which is strictly increasing. The program does not identify that swapping any two elements would make it unsorted. However, the problem statement requires finding a pair of positions to swap so that the array becomes unsorted, and for this specific case, any swap would satisfy the condition.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the array is already sorted in a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order without any adjacent elements being equal. If such a condition is met, the program should return `-1`. Here is a modified version of the function that addresses this issue:

```python
def func_3(xs, k):
    n = len(xs)
    inc = dec = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        if xs[i] > xs[i - 1]:
            inc += 1
        elif xs[i] < xs[i - 1]:
            dec += 1
    
    if inc == 0 or dec == 0:
        # The array is already sorted in a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order.
        print(-1)
        return
    
    # Find a position to swap
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if xs[i] < xs[i + 1]:
            print(i + 1, i + 2)
            return
        elif xs[i] > xs[i + 1]:
            print(i + 1, i + 2)
            return

    print(-1)
```

This modified version correctly handles the edge case where the array is already sorted in a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

from collections import deque

w = sys.stdout.write
read = sys.stdin.readline
reads = sys.stdin.read
sqrt = math.sqrt
[n] = func_1(int)
xs = func_1(int)
xss = set(xs)
if n <= 2:
    w('-1')
    sys.exit()
if len(xss) == 1:
    w('-1')
    sys.exit()
if len(xs) == 3 and xs[0] == xs[2]:

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: read() returns a string containing space-separated integers, and f is a function that converts strings to integers (if provided).
def func_1(f):
    if f :
        return map(f, read().split())
        #`The program returns a map object containing integers converted from a string of space-separated integers`
    else :
        return read().split()
        #`The program returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on spaces`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `f`. If `f` is provided, it returns a map object containing integers converted from a string of space-separated integers. If `f` is not provided, it returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on spaces. The function reads a string from the input, processes it based on the presence of `f`, and then returns the processed data accordingly. There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of lines to read, and each line is a space-separated list of non-negative integers. The function `read()` returns a string containing the content of the current line.
def func_2(t, f):
    result = []
    result_append = result.append
    for i in xrange(t):
        if f:
            result_append(tuple(map(f, read().split())))
        else:
            result_append(list(read().split()))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `t - 1`, `result` is a list. If the condition `f` is True, then `result` contains `t` tuples where each tuple is a transformation of the space-separated non-negative integers from each line read by `read()`. If the condition `f` is False, then `result` contains `t` lists where each list is the space-separated non-negative integers from each line read by `read()`
    return result
    #`The program returns a list 'result' containing 't' tuples or lists, depending on the value of 'f'. Each tuple or list corresponds to the space-separated non-negative integers from each line read by 'read()'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of lines to process, and `f`, a boolean indicating whether to transform the input into tuples or leave them as lists. The function reads `t` lines from a file using the `read()` method, splits each line into space-separated non-negative integers, and either transforms these integers into tuples (if `f` is True) or leaves them as lists (if `f` is False). The function returns a list `result` containing `t` tuples or lists, where each tuple or list corresponds to the processed line read from the file. This list is constructed during the execution of a for loop that iterates `t` times.

If the loop exits early due to `xs[0] != xs[i]`, `i` is the index where the condition holds true and the program prints "1 [i+1]" where `[i+1]` is the corresponding index value. Otherwise, `i` is `n - 1` and the program exits without printing anything.

If the loop does not exit early due to `xs[0] != xs[i]`, then `i` is `n - 1` and the program exits without printing anything. No other changes are made to the variables' values or relationships.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `xs` and an integer `k`. It analyzes the list to determine the number of increasing and decreasing adjacent pairs (`k2` and `k1` respectively). Based on the counts of these pairs, it performs specific actions using the `w()` function to print certain indices or exits the program. If the length of `xs` is less than `k`, it does not perform any specific action related to `k` and instead, the list `xs` remains unchanged. The function does not return anything explicitly, but the state of the program includes modified variables `k2` and `k1` depending on the conditions checked.
