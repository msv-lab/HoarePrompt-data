Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program. The annotated version helps us understand that the program does not handle the case where the array is already sorted in a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order without any adjacent elements being equal. This means that for arrays like `[1, 2, 3, 4]` or `[4, 3, 2, 1]`, the program fails to recognize that swapping any two elements would make the array unsorted. 

The annotated version shows that the program does not check if the array is already sorted in a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing manner before attempting to find a pair of elements to swap. Therefore, it cannot correctly identify such cases as unsortable without any swaps needed. 

To be fully correct, the program needs to include a check at the beginning to see if the array is already sorted in a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order. If it is, the program should return `-1` instead of proceeding with the current logic.
