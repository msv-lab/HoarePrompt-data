Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the annotated version of the code reveals that the program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not account for the scenario where the array is already sorted in a strict increasing or decreasing order. 

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 2 3 4
```

The program should identify that the array is already sorted in a strictly increasing order and return `-1`. However, the provided implementation does not cover this case, leading to incorrect behavior. The annotated version confirms that the program only checks for specific conditions (like having at least two increasing or decreasing pairs) but fails to check if the entire array is already sorted in a strict order.

To properly handle this, the function `func_3` should include a check to see if the array is already sorted in a strictly increasing or decreasing order and return `-1` in such cases. The revised version provided in the previous analysis addresses this issue correctly.
