Final: **False**

Reasoning:

Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is accurate. Here are the key issues identified:

1. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The annotated code does not fully address all edge cases. For instance, it does not properly check if the array is already sorted in a strictly increasing or decreasing order. This oversight is evident in the original `func_3` function where it does not handle the case where the array is already sorted in a strict order.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Strictly Sorted Arrays**: The program should return `-1` if the array is already sorted in a strictly increasing or decreasing order. However, the current implementation does not cover this scenario. For example, for the input:
   ```
   4
   1 2 3 4
   ```
   The program should output `-1`, but it does not.

3. **Incomplete Edge Case Checking**: The program includes some checks that are redundant or not comprehensive. For instance, the check for three elements with the same value (`if len(xs) == 3 and xs[0] == xs[2]:`) is unnecessary and could be simplified.

4. **Unnecessary Reversal**: The reversal of the array in the `func_3` function with `xs.reverse()` followed by another call to `func_3` does not contribute to solving the problem and introduces additional complexity without adding value.

Given these observations, the annotated version confirms that the original assessment is correct. The program does not meet the problem description in its entirety because it fails to handle the case where the array is already sorted in a strict order, which is a critical requirement. Therefore, the final assessment remains **False**.
