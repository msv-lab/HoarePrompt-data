Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code fails to handle the case where the array is already sorted in a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order without any duplicates.

Let's analyze the code:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly reads and processes the input as described.
2. **Function `func_3`**: This function is responsible for determining if any two elements can be swapped to make the array unsorted. However, it has several issues:

   - **Case 1**: If the array is already sorted in a strictly increasing order (`a1 < a2 < ... < an`), the function does not identify this as a valid case where swapping any two elements would make the array unsorted.
   - **Case 2**: Similarly, if the array is sorted in a strictly decreasing order (`a1 > a2 > ... > an`), the function does not identify this as a valid case.
   - **Case 3**: The function checks for increasing pairs (`k2`), decreasing pairs (`k1`), and the presence of duplicates. However, it does not consider the case where the array has exactly two increasing or decreasing pairs and still needs to check if a swap can make the array unsorted.

Here is an example where the code fails:

Consider the input array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. According to the problem description, we should be able to swap any two elements to make the array unsorted. However, the current implementation does not correctly identify this as a valid case.

To fix this, the code needs to handle cases where the array is already sorted in a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order and ensure that any swap of two distinct elements will make the array unsorted. Here is a revised approach:

```python
def func_3(xs, k):
    n = len(xs)
    if n <= 2:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    # Check if the array is already sorted in strictly increasing order
    if all(xs[i] < xs[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)):
        print(1, 2)
        return
    
    # Check if the array is already sorted in strictly decreasing order
    if all(xs[i] > xs[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)):
        print(1, 2)
        return
    
    # Check for increasing and decreasing pairs
    k2 = sum(1 for i in range(n - 1) if xs[i] < xs[i + 1])
    k1 = sum(1 for i in range(n - 1) if xs[i] > xs[i + 1])
    
    if k2 >= 2:
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if xs[i] < xs[i + 1]:
                print(i + 1, i + 2)
                return
    
    if k2 == 1 and k1 >= 1 and len(set(xs)) < n:
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if xs[i] > xs[i + 1]:
                print(i + 1, i + 2)
                return
            if xs[i] < xs[i + 1]:
                print(i + 1, i + 2)
                return
    
    if k2 == 1 and k1 == 0 and len(xs) >= 3:
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if xs[i] < xs[i + 1]:
                print(i + 1, i + 2)
                return
    
    if k2 == 0:
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if xs[0] != xs[i]:
                print(1, i + 1)
                return
```

With this revised approach, the code should correctly identify all valid cases where swapping any two elements will make the array unsorted.
