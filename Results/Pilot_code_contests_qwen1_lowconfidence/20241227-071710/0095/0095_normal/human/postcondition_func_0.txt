The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `curr`, which is a list of non-negative integers. It returns `True` if each element in `curr` is strictly greater than its predecessor, indicating that the list is strictly increasing. If any element is not strictly greater than its preceding element, the function returns `False`. The function handles edge cases such as empty lists and single-element lists, returning `True` for these scenarios since there are no elements to compare that violate the strictly increasing condition. There is no missing functionality noted in the provided code.
