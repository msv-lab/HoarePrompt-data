Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a given array can be made sharpened. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not used in a way that would solve the problem. The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make the array sharpened by performing the specified operations, but the provided code does not contain any logic to check this condition.

A correct solution would involve iterating through the array to find a potential pivot point `k` where the array transitions from strictly increasing to strictly decreasing, and then checking if it is possible to adjust the elements to meet the sharpened condition. The current implementation does not address this requirement and thus fails to solve the problem as described.
