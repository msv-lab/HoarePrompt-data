Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if a given array can be made sharpened through the specified operations. Let's break down the key parts:

1. **Main Logic:**
   - The code iterates through the array to check if it is already strictly increasing (`func_1`) or strictly decreasing (`func_2`).
   - If either function returns `True`, it prints "Yes" immediately.
   - Otherwise, it identifies the point where the array transitions from increasing to decreasing.
   - It then attempts to adjust the elements post-transition to ensure the array becomes sharpened.
   - If any element becomes non-positive during this adjustment, it prints "No".

2. **Functions `func_1` and `func_2`:**
   - `func_1` checks if the array is strictly increasing.
   - `func_2` checks if the array is strictly decreasing.
   - These functions are implemented correctly according to their descriptions and the problem requirements.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where the array is already sharpened by checking for strictly increasing or decreasing sequences.
   - It also ensures that adjustments do not result in any element becoming negative.

4. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations correctly summarize the state and logic of the program.
   - They accurately reflect the steps taken to determine if the array can be made sharpened.

Given the problem description and the code implementation, the program correctly identifies whether the array can be made sharpened through the specified operations. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case as per the problem description.
