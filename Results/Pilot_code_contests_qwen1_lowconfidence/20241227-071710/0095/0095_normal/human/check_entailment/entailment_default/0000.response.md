Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the array is neither strictly increasing nor strictly decreasing, and there is no clear k such that the array becomes sharpened after applying the operations. Specifically, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  4
  1 2 2 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  Yes
  ```

However, the provided code does not correctly handle this scenario. The code checks if the array is already strictly increasing or strictly decreasing using `func_1` and `func_2`. If neither function returns `True`, it tries to transform the array to become sharpened. But it does not guarantee that the array will become sharpened after the operations.

In the example `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, the code would not transform it to a sharpened array because it assumes the array needs to be modified to become strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. The correct approach would involve finding the pivot point and ensuring the array can be made sharpened through the allowed operations. The current implementation does not cover this logic, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
