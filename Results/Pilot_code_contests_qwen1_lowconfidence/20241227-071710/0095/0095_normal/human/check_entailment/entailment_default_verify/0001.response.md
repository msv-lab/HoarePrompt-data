Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the logic required to determine if an array can be made sharpened. Function `func_1` checks if the array is strictly increasing, and `func_2` checks if the array is strictly decreasing. Neither function identifies the existence of a point in the array where it transitions from strictly increasing to strictly decreasing. 

Given the problem description, the program needs to find a point in the array where it transitions from increasing to decreasing. The provided functions do not achieve this. For example, the input `[10, 15, 14, 13, 12]` should return `Yes`, but the current implementation would return `No` because neither `func_1` nor `func_2` would recognize the transition point. Thus, the original assessment of **False** is correct.
