Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the logic required to determine if an array can be made sharpened. These functions check if the array is strictly increasing (`func_1`) or strictly decreasing (`func_2`). However, the problem requires checking if there exists a point in the array where it transitions from strictly increasing to strictly decreasing.

To verify this, consider the following example:
- Input: `[10, 15, 14, 13, 12]`
- Expected Output: **Yes** (We can make the array sharpened by making the first element smaller: `[9, 15, 14, 13, 12]`)

However, neither `func_1` nor `func_2` would identify this transition point. They would simply return `False` for both increasing and decreasing checks, incorrectly indicating that the array cannot be made sharpened.

Since the program does not handle the required logic to identify a valid sharpening point, it fails for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
