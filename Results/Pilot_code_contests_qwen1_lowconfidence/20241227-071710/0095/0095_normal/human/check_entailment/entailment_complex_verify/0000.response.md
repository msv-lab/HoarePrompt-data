Final: **True**

Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment was initially marked as incorrect because the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` were not used to solve the problem as described. However, after reviewing the annotated version, it appears that the code now correctly implements the logic needed to determine if the given array can be made sharpened.

The key logic in the code involves:
1. Checking if the array is already sharpened using `func_1` or `func_2`.
2. Finding the pivot point `ind` where the array transitions from strictly increasing to strictly decreasing.
3. Adjusting the elements after the pivot point to ensure the array remains non-negative and follows the sharpened condition.

The annotated code clearly shows that the program checks if the array is already sharpened, and if not, it finds the pivot point and adjusts the elements accordingly. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used correctly within this context to validate if the array meets the sharpened condition.

Therefore, the program now meets the problem description, and the original assessment can be revised to reflect this.
