#State of the program right berfore the function call: curr is a list of non-negative integers representing the array to check if it is sharpened.
def func_1(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all(l[i] > l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n))
    #`The program returns True if all elements in `curr` are strictly greater than the previous element, otherwise it returns False`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `curr`, which is a list of non-negative integers. It returns `True` if each element in `curr` is strictly greater than its predecessor, indicating that the list is strictly increasing. If any element is not strictly greater than its preceding element, the function returns `False`. The function handles edge cases such as empty lists and single-element lists, returning `True` for these scenarios since there are no elements to compare that violate the strictly increasing condition. There is no missing functionality noted in the provided code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: curr is a list of non-negative integers with length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), where n is the same n mentioned in the main problem description.
def func_2(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all(l[i] < l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n))
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether each element in the list `curr` is less than the previous element
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `curr` of non-negative integers and returns a boolean value. This boolean value indicates whether the list is strictly decreasing, meaning each element is less than the previous one. If the list is empty or contains only one element, the function returns `True` since there are no elements to compare. If the list is not strictly decreasing, the function returns `False`.
