Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a list `curr` of non-negative integers and returns a boolean value. This boolean value indicates whether the list is strictly decreasing, meaning each element is less than the previous one. If the list is empty or contains only one element, the function returns `True` since there are no elements to compare. If the list is not strictly decreasing, the function returns `False`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the list `curr` is empty, the function returns `True`.
- If the list `curr` contains only one element, the function also returns `True`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The provided code only checks the condition for elements starting from index 1 to n-1. It does not handle the case when the list contains fewer than two elements, which should still be considered a valid strictly decreasing list. Therefore, the code should explicitly check for these edge cases.
