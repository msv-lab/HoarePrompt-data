The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `curr`, which is a list of non-negative integers. The length of the list `curr` is `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5`. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether each element in the list `curr` is less than the previous element.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a list `curr` of non-negative integers and return a boolean value based on whether each element is less than the previous one.
