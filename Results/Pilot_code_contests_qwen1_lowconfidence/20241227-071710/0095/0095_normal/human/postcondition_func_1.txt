The function `func_2` accepts a list `curr` of non-negative integers and returns a boolean value. This boolean value indicates whether the list is strictly decreasing, meaning each element is less than the previous one. If the list is empty or contains only one element, the function returns `True` since there are no elements to compare. If the list is not strictly decreasing, the function returns `False`.
