The function processes an input string representing a path, which consists of lowercase Latin letters and the '/' character, ensuring the path starts with at least one '/' and its length does not exceed 100 characters. It splits the input string by the '/' delimiter, strips leading and trailing whitespace from each segment, and then concatenates these segments back into a single string, adding a leading '/' if necessary. If no non-empty segments are found, the function outputs an empty string. The function reads the input string from standard input, modifies it according to the specified rules, and writes the result to standard output. Potential edge cases include paths with multiple consecutive '/' characters, paths with leading or trailing slashes, and empty paths.
