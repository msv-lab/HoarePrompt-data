`stdout.write(str)` writes the value of `str` to the standard output. The value of `str` is constructed by concatenating `'/'+word.strip()` for each non-empty `word` in `array`. No new value is assigned to `str` or any other variable in the given code snippet. Therefore, the only change is the output of `str`.

Given the initial state:
- `line` is the original input string.
- `path` starts with at least one `/` and the length does not exceed 100 characters.
- `array` is the list of substrings obtained by splitting `line` using the delimiter `/`.
- `str` is the concatenation of `'/'+word.strip()` for each non-empty `word` in `array`. If no words in `array` are non-empty, `str` remains an empty string.

The output will be the value of `str`, which is written to the standard output. Since no new values are assigned to variables and the only effect is the writing of `str` to the standard output, the variables themselves remain unchanged.

Output State: **`line` is the original input string, `path` starts with at least one `/` and the length does not exceed 100 characters, `array` is the list of substrings obtained by splitting `line` using the delimiter `/`, `str` is the concatenation of `'/'+word.strip()` for each non-empty `word` in `array`. The value of `str` is written to the standard output.**
