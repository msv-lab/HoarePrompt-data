`str` is updated by concatenating `str` (which is the stripped value of `word` if `word` is non-empty, otherwise an empty string) with `'/`' and the stripped value of `word`. Since the exact value of `word` is not given, we consider both cases.

- If `word` is non-empty, `str` will be updated to its current value plus `'/`' plus the stripped value of `word`.
- If `word` is empty, `str` will remain unchanged as it will be an empty string concatenated with `'/`' and an empty string, resulting in an empty string.

The states of `line`, `path`, and `array` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`line` is the original input string, `path` starts with at least one `/` and the length does not exceed 100 characters, `array` must contain at least two elements, and `str` is the original `str` plus `'/`' plus the stripped value of `word` if `word` is non-empty, otherwise `str` is an empty string.**
