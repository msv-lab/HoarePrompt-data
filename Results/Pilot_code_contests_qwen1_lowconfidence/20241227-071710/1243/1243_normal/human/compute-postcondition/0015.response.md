The function `func` accepts no parameters directly. However, based on the provided constraints, it seems the function should operate on an input string that represents a path. The input string is a path consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the '/' character. The path starts with at least one '/' and the length does not exceed 100 characters.

Given the output cases are not specified, we can infer that the function might validate or process this input string in some way, but since no specific outputs are mentioned, we'll focus solely on the input.

Functionality: **The function accepts an input string representing a path, where the path consists of lowercase Latin letters and the '/' character, starts with at least one '/', and has a length not exceeding 100 characters.**
