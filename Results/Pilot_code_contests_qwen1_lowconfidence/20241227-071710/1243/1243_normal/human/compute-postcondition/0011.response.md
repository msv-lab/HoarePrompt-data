The code appends the stripped value of `word` to `str` with a `/` in between. Since `word` is the next element in `array`, and assuming `word` is non-empty (because it's the next element in the array and arrays don't contain empty strings as elements unless specified), `str` will be updated to include the stripped value of `word` with a `/` in between.

Given the initial state:
- `line` is the original input string
- `path` starts with at least one `/` and the length does not exceed 100 characters
- `array` must contain at least one element, and `word` is the next element in `array` (non-empty)
- `str` is either the original `str` plus `'/'` plus the stripped value of `word` if `word` is non-empty, or an empty string if `word` is empty

Since `word` is non-empty, `str` will be updated to include the stripped value of `word` with a `/` in between.

Output State: **`line` is the original input string, `path` starts with at least one `/` and the length does not exceed 100 characters, `array` contains at least one element, `word` is the next element in `array`, `str` is the original `str` plus `'/'` plus the stripped value of `word`**
