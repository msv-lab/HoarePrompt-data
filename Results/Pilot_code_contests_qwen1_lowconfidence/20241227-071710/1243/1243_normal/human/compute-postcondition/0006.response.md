Postcondition: ***`line` is the original input string, `path` starts with at least one `/` and the length does not exceed 100 characters, `array` must contain at least one element, and `str` is set to the stripped value of `word` if `word` is non-empty. If `word` is empty, the postcondition remains as `str` being an empty string.***
