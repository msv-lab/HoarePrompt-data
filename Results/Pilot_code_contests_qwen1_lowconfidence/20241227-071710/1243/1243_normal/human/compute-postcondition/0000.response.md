The code reads a line from standard input and assigns it to the variable `line`. This means that the content of `line` will be whatever was inputted, and the initial state's condition about the input string being a path starting with at least one `/` and having a length not exceeding 100 characters is preserved.

Output State: **the input string is assigned to `line`; the path starts with at least one `/` and the length does not exceed 100 characters**
