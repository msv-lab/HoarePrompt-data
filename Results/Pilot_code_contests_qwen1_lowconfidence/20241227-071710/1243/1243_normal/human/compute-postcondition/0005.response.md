The code `str = str + '/' + word.strip()` concatenates the existing value of `str` (which is an empty string) with a forward slash (`/`) and the stripped version of `word`. Since `str` was initially an empty string, the updated value of `str` will be the same as `word.strip()`.

- The value of `path` is not affected.
- The value of `array` is not affected.
- The value of `line` is not affected.
- The value of `word` is not directly used in the calculation, but its stripped version is used to update `str`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`line` is the original input string, `path` starts with at least one `/` and the length does not exceed 100 characters, `array` must contain at least one element, `str` is equal to `word.strip()`, the current value of `word` is non-empty**.
