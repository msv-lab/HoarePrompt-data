The `split` method is called on the `line` string using the delimiter `/`. This method splits the `line` string into a list of substrings based on the delimiter and assigns this list to the `array` variable. The original `line` string is still valid, and the path remains unchanged.

Output State: **the input string is assigned to `line`; the path starts with at least one `/` and the length does not exceed 100 characters; `array` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `line` using the delimiter `/`**
