Output State: **`line` is the original input string, `path` starts with at least one `/` and the length does not exceed 100 characters, `array` is the list of substrings obtained by splitting `line` using the delimiter `/`, and `str` is the concatenation of `'/'+word.strip()` for each non-empty `word` in `array`. If no words in `array` are non-empty, `str` remains an empty string.**
