According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `array`. For the loop to execute again, `array` must contain at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `line` is the original input string
- `path` starts with at least one `/` and the length does not exceed 100 characters
- `array` must contain at least one element
- `str` is set to the stripped value of `word` if `word` is non-empty. If `word` is empty, `str` remains an empty string

For the loop to execute one more time, `array` must still contain at least one element. The other variables (`line`, `path`, and `str`) remain unchanged since they are not affected by the loop itself.

State: **`line` is the original input string, `path` starts with at least one `/` and the length does not exceed 100 characters, `array` must contain at least two elements, and `str` is set to the stripped value of `word` if `word` is non-empty. If `word` is empty, the postcondition remains as `str` being an empty string.**
