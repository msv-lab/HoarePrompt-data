Functionality: **The function processes an input string representing a path, which consists of lowercase Latin letters and the '/' character, ensuring the path starts with at least one '/' and its length does not exceed 100 characters. It splits the input string by the '/' delimiter, strips leading and trailing whitespace from each segment, and then concatenates these segments back into a single string, adding a leading '/' if necessary. If no non-empty segments are found, the function outputs an empty string. The function reads the input string from standard input, modifies it according to the specified rules, and writes the result to standard output. Potential edge cases include paths with multiple consecutive '/' characters, paths with leading or trailing slashes, and empty paths.**

**The function does not handle missing or invalid input (e.g., non-Latin letters or other special characters), which could lead to unexpected behavior if such inputs are given. Additionally, the function assumes that the input is read correctly from standard input and that the output is written to standard output without any errors.**
