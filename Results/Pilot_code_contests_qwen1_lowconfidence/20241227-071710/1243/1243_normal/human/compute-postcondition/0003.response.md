According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `array` variable. The loop will execute if `array` contains at least one element.

Before the loop starts, the given states are:
- `line` is the original input string
- `path` starts with at least one `/` and the length does not exceed 100 characters
- `array` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `line` using the delimiter `/`
- `str` is an empty string

Since the loop depends on `array` having at least one element, we need to ensure that `array` is not empty. 

Hereâ€™s the modified state:

State: **`line` is the original input string, `path` starts with at least one `/` and the length does not exceed 100 characters, `array` must contain at least one element, `str` is an empty string**
