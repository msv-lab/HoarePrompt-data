Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where the input path consists solely of multiple consecutive '/' characters without any other characters. For example, the input `///` should normalize to `/`, but the current implementation will output an empty string because the `word.strip()` operation removes all characters, including the leading '/'. 

To fix this, you can add a condition to ensure that the output string always includes at least one '/':

```python
def func():
    line = stdin.readline()
    array = line.split('/')
    str = '/' if array[0] == '' else ''
    for word in array[1:]:
        if word != '':
            str = str + '/' + word.strip()
    stdout.write(str)
```

With this modification, the program will correctly handle the edge case where the input path consists only of multiple consecutive '/' characters.
