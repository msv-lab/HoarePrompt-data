Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program still does not handle the case where multiple consecutive slashes at the end of the path are present after stripping the words. Specifically, the annotated version shows that `str` is constructed by concatenating `'/'+word.strip()` for each non-empty `word` in `array`. However, it does not account for removing the trailing slashes properly. The original assessment correctly points out that the program will output `/usr/local/nginx///sbin/` for the input `//usr///local//nginx///sbin/`, which is not the expected normalized form `/usr/local/nginx/sbin`. Therefore, the program needs an additional step to remove these trailing slashes.
