Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated version highlights that the program fails to handle the case where multiple consecutive slashes at the end of the path are present after stripping the words. Specifically, the input `//usr///local//nginx///sbin/` results in the output `/usr/local/nginx///sbin/` instead of the expected `/usr/local/nginx/sbin`. This indicates that the program does not completely remove trailing slashes, which violates the requirement for the path to be in its normalized form. Therefore, the original assessment correctly identifies the issue with the program.
