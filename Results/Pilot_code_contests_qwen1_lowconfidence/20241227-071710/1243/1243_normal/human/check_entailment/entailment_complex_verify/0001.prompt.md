You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The new operating system BerOS has a nice feature. It is possible to use any number of characters '/' as a delimiter in path instead of one traditional '/'. For example, strings //usr///local//nginx/sbin// and /usr/local/nginx///sbin are equivalent. The character '/' (or some sequence of such characters) at the end of the path is required only in case of the path to the root directory, which can be represented as single character '/'.

A path called normalized if it contains the smallest possible number of characters '/'.

Your task is to transform a given path to the normalized form.

Input

The first line of the input contains only lowercase Latin letters and character '/' â€” the path to some directory. All paths start with at least one character '/'. The length of the given line is no more than 100 characters, it is not empty.

Output

The path in normalized form.

Examples

Input

//usr///local//nginx/sbin


Output

/usr/local/nginx/sbin
Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout

def func():
    line = stdin.readline()
    array = line.split('/')
    str = ''
    for word in array:
        if word != '':
            str = str + '/' + word.strip()
    stdout.write(str)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where multiple consecutive slashes at the end of the path are present after stripping the words. Specifically, consider the input `//usr///local//nginx///sbin/`. The program will output `/usr/local/nginx///sbin/` instead of the expected `/usr/local/nginx/sbin`. This happens because the trailing slashes are not completely removed, leaving extra slashes in the final result. To fix this, an additional check and processing step is needed to remove trailing slashes properly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from sys import stdin, stdout

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input string is a path consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the '/' character. The path starts with at least one '/' and the length does not exceed 100 characters.
def func():
    line = stdin.readline()
    array = line.split('/')
    str = ''
    for word in array:
        if word != '':
            str = str + '/' + word.strip()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `line` is the original input string, `path` starts with at least one `/` and the length does not exceed 100 characters, `array` is the list of substrings obtained by splitting `line` using the delimiter `/`, and `str` is the concatenation of `'/'+word.strip()` for each non-empty `word` in `array`. If no words in `array` are non-empty, `str` remains an empty string.
    stdout.write(str)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an input string representing a path, which consists of lowercase Latin letters and the '/' character, ensuring the path starts with at least one '/' and its length does not exceed 100 characters. It splits the input string by the '/' delimiter, strips leading and trailing whitespace from each segment, and then concatenates these segments back into a single string, adding a leading '/' if necessary. If no non-empty segments are found, the function outputs an empty string. The function reads the input string from standard input, modifies it according to the specified rules, and writes the result to standard output. Potential edge cases include paths with multiple consecutive '/' characters, paths with leading or trailing slashes, and empty paths.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
