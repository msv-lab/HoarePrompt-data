Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where multiple consecutive slashes at the end of the path are present after stripping the words. Specifically, consider the input `//usr///local//nginx///sbin/`. The program will output `/usr/local/nginx///sbin/` instead of the expected `/usr/local/nginx/sbin`. This happens because the trailing slashes are not completely removed, leaving extra slashes in the final result. To fix this, an additional check and processing step is needed to remove trailing slashes properly.
