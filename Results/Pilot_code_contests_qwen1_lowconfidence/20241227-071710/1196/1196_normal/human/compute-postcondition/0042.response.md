`s` is updated by adding the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space. The original value of `s` was an empty string plus the string representation of `l[i][k+1]` followed by a space. The value of `c` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`s` is now an empty string plus the string representation of `l[i][k+1]` followed by the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space; `c` is greater than 0.**
