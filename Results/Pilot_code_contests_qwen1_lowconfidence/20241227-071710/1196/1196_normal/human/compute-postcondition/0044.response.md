`s` is initially an empty string plus the string representation of `l[i][k+1]` followed by the string representation of `l[i][k+2]` followed by a space. The code appends the string representation of `l[i][j]` to `s` and adds a space. Since `s` already has a trailing space, adding another space would make the final space redundant. Therefore, the updated `s` will be the string representation of `l[i][k+1]` followed by the string representation of `l[i][k+2]` followed by the string representation of `l[i][j]`. The variable `c` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is now the string representation of `l[i][k+1]` followed by the string representation of `l[i][k+2]` followed by the string representation of `l[i][j]`; `c` is greater than 0**
