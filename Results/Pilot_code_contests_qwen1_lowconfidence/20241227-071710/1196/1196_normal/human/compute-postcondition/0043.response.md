According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `j` and the value of `c`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `c`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is updated by adding the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space.
- The original value of `s` was an empty string plus the string representation of `l[i][k+1]` followed by a space.
- The value of `c` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.

Since the loop iterates over `range(c)`, at the start of each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was equal to the current value of `k+1`, and `s` had the string representation of `l[i][k+1]` followed by a space. For the loop to continue, `j` needs to be incremented to `k+2`.

The new state should reflect that `s` now includes both `l[i][k+1]` and `l[i][j]` (where `j` is now `k+2`), and `c` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.

State: **`s` is now an empty string plus the string representation of `l[i][k+1]` followed by the string representation of `l[i][k+2]` followed by a space; `c` is greater than 0.**
