The code `s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '` updates the string `s` by appending the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space. Given that `j` is 3, `l[i][j]` refers to the element at index 3 of the sublist `l[i]`. The initial state of `j` is 3, so this operation appends the value of `l[i][3]` to `s`.

The output state is:
**`s` is the original string `s` plus the string representation of `l[i][3]` followed by a space, `c` is the length of the sublist `l[i+1]`, and `j` is 3.**
