The code swaps the values of `r` and `c`. Initially, `c` is set to 1 and `r` is an input integer within the range 1 to 500. After executing `r, c = c, r`, the value of `r` becomes the original value of `c` (which is 1), and the value of `c` becomes the original value of `r`.

Output State: **`r` is 1, `c` is an input integer within the range 1 to 500, `flag` is True**
