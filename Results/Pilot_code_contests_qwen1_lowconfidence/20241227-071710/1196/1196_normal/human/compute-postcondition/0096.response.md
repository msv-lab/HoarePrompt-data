`s` is initially set to `'val ' + str(l[1][c+1]) + ' '`. The code `s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space to `s`. Given the initial values, `i` is 2, `j` is `c + 1`, and `c` remains the same.

Since `i` is 2 and `j` is `c + 1`, the new value of `s` will be the original value of `s` plus the string representation of `l[2][c+1]` followed by a space. Therefore, the updated value of `s` is:

`s` is `'val ' + str(l[1][c+1]) + ' ' + str(l[2][c+1]) + ' '`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `r` must be greater than 1, `s` is `'val ' + str(l[1][c+1]) + ' ' + str(l[2][c+1]) + ' '`, `j` is `c + 1`, `c` remains the same, `flag` remains `True`, `l` remains the same, `b` remains the same**
