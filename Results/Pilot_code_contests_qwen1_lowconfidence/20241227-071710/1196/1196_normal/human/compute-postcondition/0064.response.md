`s` is updated by adding the string representation of `l[i][j]` (which is `l[i][1]` since `j` is 1) and a space. The initial value of `s` is `"l[i][0] l[i][0]"`. After the addition, `s` becomes `"l[i][0] l[i][0]l[i][1] "`.

Output State: **`s` is "l[i][0] l[i][0]l[i][1] ", `c` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1**
