Postcondition: **`r` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `c` is an integer within the range 1 to 500. If `r == 1` and `c == 1`, then `flag` is `True`, `l` is a list of lists where each `l[i][j]` is the product of the initial value of `b[i]` and `b[r + j]` raised to the power of `j`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`. If `r != 1` or `c != 1`, then `flag` is `True`, `s` is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the sublist `l[r-1]`, separated by spaces, `c` is the length of the sublist `l[r-1]`, and `j` is `c - 1`. The loop prints `s` for each row `i` from `0` to `r-1`. If `flag` is `False`, then `i` is `r`, `s` is a string containing the concatenation of the string representations of `l[i][j]` for all `j` from `0` to `c-1`, `j` is `c`, and `c` must be greater than 0.**
