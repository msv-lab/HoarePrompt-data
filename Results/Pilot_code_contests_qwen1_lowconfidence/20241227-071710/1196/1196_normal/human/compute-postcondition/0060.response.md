`s` is concatenated with the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space. Since `l` is not defined in the initial state, and no specific values are given for `i` and `j`, we can only say that `s` now includes the element from list `l` at position `[i][j]` followed by a space. The values of `c` and `j` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the operation.

Output State: **`s` is an empty string plus the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space, `c` must be greater than 0, `j` is `c - 1`**
