`s` is updated by appending the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space. Since the initial state of `i` is 0, `j` is `c + 1`, and assuming `l[0][c+1]` is a specific value (let's denote it as `val`), `s` will become `'val '`.

The values of `i`, `r`, `j`, `c`, `flag`, `l`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `r` must be greater than 0, `s` is `'val '`, `j` is `c + 1`, `c` remains the same, `flag` remains `True`, `l` remains the same, `b` remains the same**
