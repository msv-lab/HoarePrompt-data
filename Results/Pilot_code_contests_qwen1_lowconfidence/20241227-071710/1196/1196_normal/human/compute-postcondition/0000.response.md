The code reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `r` and `c`. The original values of `r` and `c` are replaced by the integers entered by the user. Since the initial state specifies that `1 ≤ r, c ≤ 500`, the output state will reflect the new values of `r` and `c` as input integers within this range.

Output State: **`r` is an input integer within the range 1 to 500, `c` is an input integer within the range 1 to 500**
