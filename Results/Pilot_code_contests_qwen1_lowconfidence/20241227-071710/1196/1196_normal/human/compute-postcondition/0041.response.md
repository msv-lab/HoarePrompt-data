According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `c`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `c`.

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is an empty string plus the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space, and `c` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` should become `j + 1`.

Given that `c` must be greater than 0, and assuming `c` remains unchanged, we need to ensure that `j` is still less than `c` for the next iteration.

So, if `j` was previously `k` (where `k < c`), then at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.

Let's denote the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration as `k` (since it's not specified explicitly, we use `k` to represent this value).

State: **`s` is an empty string plus the string representation of `l[i][k+1]` followed by a space, `c` must be greater than 0**
