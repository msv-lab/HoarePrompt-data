Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `s` is an empty string (`''`).
- `c` is the length of the sublist `l[i+1]`.

### Loop Code
```python
for j in range(c):
    s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '
```

### Analysis
- The loop iterates over the elements of the sublist `l[i+1]` using the index `j`.
- For each iteration, the string `s` is updated by appending the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space.

### Iterations
- After the loop executes `c` times, `s` will contain the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the sublist `l[i+1]`, separated by spaces.
- The final value of `s` will be the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `l[i+1]`, with a space after each element.
- The value of `c` remains unchanged and equals the length of the sublist `l[i+1]` throughout the loop.
- The value of `j` will be `c-1` after the loop finishes, as it increments from `0` to `c-1`.

### Final State
- The loop will execute `c` times, covering all elements in the sublist `l[i+1]`.
- Therefore, `s` will contain the string representations of all elements in `l[i+1]`, separated by spaces.
- `c` will be the length of the sublist `l[i+1]`.
- `j` will be `c-1`.

### Output State
- **Output State:** `s` is the string containing the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the sublist `l[i+1]`, separated by spaces, `c` is the length of the sublist `l[i+1]`, and `j` is `c-1`.

This ensures that we capture the state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have completed.
