According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `c`. The loop condition is `j < c`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is an empty string plus the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space, `c` is greater than 0, and `j` is `c - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and still satisfy the condition `j < c`. Therefore, `j` becomes `c - 1 + 1 = c`. Since `c` is greater than 0, `j` will be 0, and the condition `j < c` will be true.

The state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:
State: **`s` is an empty string plus the string representation of `l[i][0]` followed by a space, `c` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
