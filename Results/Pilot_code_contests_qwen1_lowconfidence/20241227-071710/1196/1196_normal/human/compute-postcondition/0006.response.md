`flag` is assigned the value `True`. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is an input integer within the range 1 to 500; `c` is an input integer within the range 1 to 500 and the current value of `c` is 1; `flag` is True.

Output State: **`r` is an input integer within the range 1 to 500; `c` is an input integer within the range 1 to 500 and the current value of `c` is 1; `flag` is True**
