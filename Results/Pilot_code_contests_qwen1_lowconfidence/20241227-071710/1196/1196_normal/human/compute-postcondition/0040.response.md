The code `s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '` updates the string `s` by appending the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `l`, `i`, or `j`. The only thing we know is that `s` is an empty string and `c` must be greater than 0.

After the code runs, `s` will be updated to include the string representation of `l[i][j]` and a space. The value of `c` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it. 

Output State: **`s` is an empty string plus the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space, `c` must be greater than 0**
