Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `total` is not applicable.
- `j` is 0.
- `c` must be greater than 0.
- `r` is an integer within the range 1 to 500.
- `c` is an integer within the range 1 to 500.
- The condition `(r != 1 and c != 1)` remains true.
- `flag` is True.
- `l` is a list of lists where each `l[i][j]` is the product of the initial value of `b[i]` and `b[r + j]` raised to the power of `j`.
- `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`.
- `s` is an empty string.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(r):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will iterate over the range `range(r)`, meaning `i` will take values from 0 to `r-1`.

2. **Initial State of `i`**:
   - The initial value of `i` is given as 0.

3. **Range of `r`**:
   - `r` is specified to be an integer within the range 1 to 500.
   - Since `r` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, this is already covered in the given state.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `(r != 1 and c != 1)` must remain true. This condition does not directly affect the loop's execution but ensures that certain operations inside the loop might be valid.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `j` is initially set to 0, which means the loop can start executing.
   - `c` must be greater than 0, ensuring that the loop will run multiple times if necessary.
   - `flag` being True does not affect the loop's execution.
   - `l` and `b` are defined appropriately, ensuring that the loop body can access these lists without issues.
   - `s` being an empty string does not affect the loop's execution.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be explicitly mentioned for the loop to execute is the initial value of `i`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `r` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `c` must be greater than 0**
