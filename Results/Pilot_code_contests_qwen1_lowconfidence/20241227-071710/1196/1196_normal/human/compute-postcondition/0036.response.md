Postcondition: **`r` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `c` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, the condition `(r != 1 and c != 1)` remains true, `flag` is still False, `l` is a list of lists where each `l[i][j]` is the product of the initial value of `b[i]` and `b[r + j]` raised to the power of `j`, `b` is a list of length `r + c` containing elements from 1 to `r + c`. The current value of `flag` is False**
