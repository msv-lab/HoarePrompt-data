`s` is updated by appending the string representation of `l[i][j]` (where `j` is 1) followed by a space. Since `j` is 1, `l[i][1]` is concatenated to `s`. The length of the sublist `l[i+1]` (`c`) remains unchanged, and `j` is incremented by 1, making it 2.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `s` is now the original string `s` plus the string representation of `l[i][1]` followed by a space.
- `c` remains the same as it was originally.
- `j` is now 2.

Output State: **`s` is the original string `s` plus the string representation of `l[i][1]` followed by a space, `c` is the length of the sublist `l[i+1]`, and `j` is 2.**
