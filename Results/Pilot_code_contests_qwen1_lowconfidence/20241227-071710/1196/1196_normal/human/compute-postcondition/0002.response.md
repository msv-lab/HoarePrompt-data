The code `print(0)` prints the integer 0 to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `r` and `c`. The Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`r` is an input integer within the range 1 to 500, `c` is an input integer within the range 1 to 500, and the current values of `r` and `c` are both 1**
