According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `c`. The loop condition is `j < c`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is the original string `s` plus the string representation of `l[i][1]` followed by a space, `c` is the length of the sublist `l[i+1]`, and `j` is 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `c`. Since `j` was 2 at the end of the last iteration, it needs to be incremented to 3 for the loop to continue. Therefore, `j` should be 3.

State: **`s` is the original string `s` plus the string representation of `l[i][1]` followed by a space, `c` is the length of the sublist `l[i+1]`, and `j` is 3**.
