According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `0` to `c`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `c`, and `l[i][j]` is updated to its original value multiplied by `b[i] * b[r + c]`. All other variables (`r`, `c`, `flag`, `l`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variable `j`. Since the loop iterates from `0` to `c-1`, if `j` is equal to `c` at the end of the previous iteration, it means the loop has already executed `c` times. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be set to `0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`j` is 0, `l[i][j]` is updated to its original value multiplied by `b[i] * b[r + c]`, all other variables (`r`, `c`, `flag`, `l`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged.**
