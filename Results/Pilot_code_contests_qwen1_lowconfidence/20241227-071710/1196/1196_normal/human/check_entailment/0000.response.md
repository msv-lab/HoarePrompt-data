Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `r` and `c` are both 1 correctly. According to the problem description, if `r` and `c` are both 1, the output should be `0`. However, the program prints a 1x1 matrix filled with the value 1 instead of printing `0`.

To fix this, you need to handle the special case where `r == 1` and `c == 1` before generating the matrix. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (r, c) = map(int, input().split())
    if r == 1 and c == 1:
        print(0)
    else:
        flag = False
        if c == 1:
            flag = True
            (r, c) = (c, r)
        l = [[1 for _ in range(c)] for _ in range(r)]
        b = [i + 1 for i in range(r + c)]
        for i in range(r):
            for j in range(c):
                l[i][j] *= b[i] * b[r + j]
        if flag == False:
            for i in range(r):
                s = ''
                for j in range(c):
                    s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '
                print(s)
        else:
            for j in range(c):
                s = ''
                for i in range(r):
                    s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '
                print(s)

func()
```

With this correction, the program now handles the special case correctly and should work for all other cases as well.
