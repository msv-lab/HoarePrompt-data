You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let a be a matrix of size r × c containing positive integers, not necessarily distinct. Rows of the matrix are numbered from 1 to r, columns are numbered from 1 to c. We can construct an array b consisting of r + c integers as follows: for each i ∈ [1, r], let b_i be the greatest common divisor of integers in the i-th row, and for each j ∈ [1, c] let b_{r+j} be the greatest common divisor of integers in the j-th column. 

We call the matrix diverse if all r + c numbers b_k (k ∈ [1, r + c]) are pairwise distinct. 

The magnitude of a matrix equals to the maximum of b_k.

For example, suppose we have the following matrix:

\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 9 & 7\\\ 4 & 144 & 84 \end{pmatrix} 

We construct the array b:

  1. b_1 is the greatest common divisor of 2, 9, and 7, that is 1; 
  2. b_2 is the greatest common divisor of 4, 144, and 84, that is 4; 
  3. b_3 is the greatest common divisor of 2 and 4, that is 2; 
  4. b_4 is the greatest common divisor of 9 and 144, that is 9; 
  5. b_5 is the greatest common divisor of 7 and 84, that is 7. 



So b = [1, 4, 2, 9, 7]. All values in this array are distinct, so the matrix is diverse. The magnitude is equal to 9.

For a given r and c, find a diverse matrix that minimises the magnitude. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them. If there are no solutions, output a single integer 0. 

Input

The only line in the input contains two space separated integers r and c (1 ≤ r,c ≤ 500) — the number of rows and the number of columns of the matrix to be found.

Output

If there is no solution, output a single integer 0.

Otherwise, output r rows. The i-th of them should contain c space-separated integers, the j-th of which is a_{i,j} — the positive integer in the i-th row and j-th column of a diverse matrix minimizing the magnitude.

Furthermore, it must hold that 1 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^9. It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is also a solution with this additional constraint (still having minimum possible magnitude).

Examples

Input


2 2


Output


4 12
2 9

Input


1 1


Output


0

Note

In the first example, the GCDs of rows are b_1 = 4 and b_2 = 1, and the GCDs of columns are b_3 = 2 and b_4 = 3. All GCDs are pairwise distinct and the maximum of them is 4. Since the GCDs have to be distinct and at least 1, it is clear that there are no diverse matrices of size 2 × 2 with magnitude smaller than 4.

In the second example, no matter what a_{1,1} is, b_1 = b_2 will always hold, so there are no diverse matrices.
Program:
```
def func():
    (r, c) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if r == 1 and c == 1:
        print(0)
    else:
        flag = False
        if c == 1:
            flag = True
            (r, c) = (c, r)
        l = [[1 for _ in range(c)] for _ in range(r)]
        b = [i + 1 for i in range(r + c)]
        for i in range(r):
            for j in range(c):
                l[i][j] *= b[i] * b[r + j]
        if flag == False:
            for i in range(r):
                s = ''
                for j in range(c):
                    s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '
                print(s)
        else:
            for j in range(c):
                s = ''
                for i in range(r):
                    s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '
                print(s)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where both `r` and `c` are greater than 1 and produce a matrix that is diverse and minimizes the magnitude. Specifically, the program constructs a matrix where each element is the product of the corresponding row and column GCDs, but this approach does not guarantee that the resulting matrix will be diverse.

For example, consider the input `2 2`. The program generates the matrix:
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
4 & 12 \\
2 & 9
\end{pmatrix}
\]
The GCDs of the rows are:
- \(b_1 = \text{gcd}(4, 12) = 4\)
- \(b_2 = \text{gcd}(2, 9) = 1\)

The GCDs of the columns are:
- \(b_3 = \text{gcd}(4, 2) = 2\)
- \(b_4 = \text{gcd}(12, 9) = 3\)

The array \(b\) is \([4, 2, 1, 3]\), which is not diverse because the GCDs \(b_1 = 4\) and \(b_2 = 1\) are not distinct from each other.

A correct approach would involve generating a matrix where the GCDs of rows and columns are distinct and minimized. For instance, a correct solution for the input `2 2` could be:
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 3 \\
4 & 6
\end{pmatrix}
\]
The GCDs of the rows are:
- \(b_1 = \text{gcd}(2, 3) = 1\)
- \(b_2 = \text{gcd}(4, 6) = 2\)

The GCDs of the columns are:
- \(b_3 = \text{gcd}(2, 4) = 2\)
- \(b_4 = \text{gcd}(3, 6) = 3\)

The array \(b\) is \([1, 2, 2, 3]\), which is not diverse, but this is just one example. A truly diverse matrix for this input could be:
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 3 \\
4 & 5
\end{pmatrix}
\]
Here, the GCDs of the rows are:
- \(b_1 = \text{gcd}(2, 3) = 1\)
- \(b_2 = \text{gcd}(4, 5) = 1\)

The GCDs of the columns are:
- \(b_3 = \text{gcd}(2, 4) = 2\)
- \(b_4 = \text{gcd}(3, 5) = 1\)

The array \(b\) is \([1, 2, 1, 1]\), which is not diverse, but this is a valid attempt. A truly diverse matrix with distinct GCDs could be:
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 3 \\
4 & 7
\end{pmatrix}
\]
Here, the GCDs of the rows are:
- \(b_1 = \text{gcd}(2, 3) = 1\)
- \(b_2 = \text{gcd}(4, 7) = 1\)

The GCDs of the columns are:
- \(b_3 = \text{gcd}(2, 4) = 2\)
- \(b_4 = \text{gcd}(3, 7) = 1\)

The array \(b\) is \([1, 2, 1, 1]\), which is not diverse, but this is a valid attempt. A truly diverse matrix with distinct GCDs could be:
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 3 \\
4 & 5
\end{pmatrix}
\]

This example shows that the provided program does not generate a diverse matrix for all cases, hence it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two integers \( r \) and \( c \) from the standard input, where both \( r \) and \( c \) are within the range 1 to 500. It then constructs a matrix \( l \) of size \( r \times c \) where each element \( l[i][j] \) is calculated as the product of the initial value of \( b[i] \) and \( b[r + j] \) raised to the power of \( j \). Here, \( b \) is a list containing the first \( r + c \) natural numbers. Based on the values of \( r \) and \( c \), the function determines whether to transpose the matrix \( l \) before printing its contents. Specifically, if \( r \neq 1 \) and \( c \neq 1 \), the function prints the matrix \( l \) as is. If \( c = 1 \) and \( r \neq 1 \), the function transposes the matrix and prints it. If \( r = 1 \) and \( c = 1 \), the function prints 0 directly without constructing the matrix.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
