The function reads two integers \( r \) and \( c \) from the standard input, where both \( r \) and \( c \) are within the range 1 to 500. It then constructs a matrix \( l \) of size \( r \times c \) where each element \( l[i][j] \) is calculated as the product of the initial value of \( b[i] \) and \( b[r + j] \) raised to the power of \( j \). Here, \( b \) is a list containing the first \( r + c \) natural numbers. Based on the values of \( r \) and \( c \), the function determines whether to transpose the matrix \( l \) before printing its contents. Specifically, if \( r \neq 1 \) and \( c \neq 1 \), the function prints the matrix \( l \) as is. If \( c = 1 \) and \( r \neq 1 \), the function transposes the matrix and prints it. If \( r = 1 \) and \( c = 1 \), the function prints 0 directly without constructing the matrix.
