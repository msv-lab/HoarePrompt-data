Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly compute the length of the longest increasing subsequence. Instead, it attempts to find the first position in the dynamic programming array `dp` where the value is still `float('inf')`, which does not represent the length of the longest increasing subsequence. The variable `dp` is intended to store the smallest tail values for increasing subsequences of different lengths, but the code does not properly update or utilize this array to find the length of the LIS.

To fix this, the code should find the length of the longest subsequence by determining how many elements can be placed in `dp` without causing it to change, as this indicates the number of elements in the longest increasing subsequence. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import bisect

def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(input()) for i in range(n)]
    dp = []
    for num in a:
        pos = bisect.bisect_left(dp, num)
        if pos == len(dp):
            dp.append(num)
        else:
            dp[pos] = num
    print(len(dp))

func()
```

This corrected code maintains a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` is the smallest possible tail value for an increasing subsequence of length `i+1`. The length of `dp` at the end of the loop will be the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
