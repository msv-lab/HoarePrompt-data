Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly compute the length of the longest increasing subsequence. Instead, it attempts to use a binary search approach with a dynamic programming array `dp` to find the first position where `dp[i]` is `float('inf')`, which is not the correct way to find the length of the LIS. 

The correct approach would involve maintaining a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending with `a[i]`. The code should iterate through each element and update the `dp` array accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    
    dp = [1] * n  # Initialize dp array with 1 because each element is an increasing subsequence of length 1
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            if a[i] > a[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    
    print(max(dp))
```

This corrected version correctly computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
