You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: For a given sequence A = {a0, a1, ... , an-1}, find the length of the longest increasing subsequnece (LIS) in A.

An increasing subsequence of A is defined by a subsequence {ai0, ai1, ... , aik} where 0 ≤ i0 < i1 < ... < ik < n and ai0 < ai1 < ... < aik.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000
* 0 ≤ ai ≤ 109

Input

In the first line, an integer n is given. In the next n lines, elements of A are given.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import bisect

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, and a list A = [a0, a1, ..., an-1] where each ai is an integer such that 0 ≤ ai ≤ 109.
def func():
    n = input()
    a = [input() for i in xrange(n)]
    dp = [float('inf') for _ in xrange(n)]
    for i in xrange(n):
        dp[bisect.bisect_left(dp, a[i])] = a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9 for each `i` where 0 ≤ i < n, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where the first k elements (k being the length of the unique sorted subsequence of `a`) are the sorted unique elements of `a`, and the rest are `float('inf')`, `i` is `n`
    for i in xrange(n):
        if dp[i] == float('inf'):
            print(i)
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is the index of the first non-`inf` element in `dp` or `n-1` if all elements in `dp` are `float('inf')`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list \( A \) of integers \( a_i \) where the length of the list is \( n \) such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100000 \), and each element \( a_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \). The function computes the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in the list \( A \) and prints the index of the first position where the dynamic programming array \( dp \) contains `float('inf')`. If all elements in \( dp \) are `float('inf')`, it prints \( n-1 \).
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
