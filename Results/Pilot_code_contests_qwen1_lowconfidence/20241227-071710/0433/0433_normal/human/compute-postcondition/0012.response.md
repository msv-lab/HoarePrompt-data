The code `print(i)` prints the value of `i`. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `i`. Therefore, `i` is printed as it is. No other variables are affected by this code.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is equal to infinity, dp is a list of floats where each element was initially set to infinity, the value of `i` is printed**
