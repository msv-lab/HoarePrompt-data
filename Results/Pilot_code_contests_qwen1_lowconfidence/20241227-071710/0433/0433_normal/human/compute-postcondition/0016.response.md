The code `print(i)` prints the value of `i`. However, the value of `i` itself does not change. The other variables remain in their initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `dp[i]` is equal to infinity, `dp[i+1]` is not infinity, and the value of `i` is printed.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is equal to infinity, `dp[i+1]` is not infinity, the value of `i` is printed**
