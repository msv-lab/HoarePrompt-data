The code snippet `dp[bisect.bisect_left(dp, a[i])] = a[i]` impacts the following:
- `dp` is updated at the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(dp, a[i])` with the value of `a[i]`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 but not used in the code snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9 for each `i` where `0 ≤ i < n`
- `dp` is a list of `n` elements each set to float('inf')
- `i` is 0

After executing the code snippet:
- `i` is now 1 because it was incremented by 1.
- `dp` is updated at the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(dp, a[0])` with the value of `a[0]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9 for each `i` where `0 ≤ i < n`, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `a[0]` and the rest are float('inf'), `i` is 1**
