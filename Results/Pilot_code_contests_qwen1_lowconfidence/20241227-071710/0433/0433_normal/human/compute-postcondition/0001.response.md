The code snippet `a = [input() for i in xrange(n)]` takes each element from the input and assigns it to a list `a`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100000, and each `ai` (for `0 ≤ i < n`) is an integer between 0 and 10^9, the list `a` will contain `n` integers.

Here is the step-by-step calculation:

1. The list comprehension `[input() for i in xrange(n)]` runs `n` times, taking one integer input from the user each time.
2. Each input integer is assigned to the corresponding index in the list `a`.

Since the exact values of the inputs are not specified, we represent them generically as `a0, a1, ..., an-1`, where each `ai` is an integer between 0 and 10^9.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9 for each `i` where `0 ≤ i < n`.**
