`i` is bisected into the list `dp`. The value of `a[i]` is inserted into `dp` at the position found by `bisect_left`. Since `i` is 3, `a[3]` is inserted into `dp` at the position found by `bisect_left(dp, a[3])`.

Given that `dp` initially starts with the first two elements being `a[0]` and `a[1]`, and the rest being `float('inf')`, the insertion will affect the subsequent elements in `dp`.

Let's consider the possible scenarios for the position where `a[3]` is inserted:

- If `a[3]` is less than `a[0]`, it will be inserted at the beginning, making `dp[0] = a[3]`.
- If `a[3]` is between `a[0]` and `a[1]`, it will be inserted at the position where it fits, updating the corresponding element.
- If `a[3]` is greater than `a[1]` but less than the next `float('inf')`, it will be inserted at the appropriate position.
- If `a[3]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `dp` (which would happen if `a[3]` is larger than `a[n-1]`), it will be appended to the end of `dp`.

Since the exact value of `a[3]` is not specified, we can only express the updated `dp` in terms of its known elements and the new insertion.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of n integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each i where 0 ≤ i < n, `dp` is a list of n elements where the first two elements are `a[0]` and `a[1]`, the third element is `a[3]`, and the rest are `float('inf')`, `i` is 3**
