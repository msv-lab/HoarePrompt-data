Functionality: **The function accepts a list \( A \) of integers \( a_i \) where the length of the list is \( n \) such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100000 \), and each element \( a_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \). The function computes the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in the list \( A \) and prints the index of the first position where the dynamic programming array \( dp \) contains `float('inf')`. If all elements in \( dp \) are `float('inf')`, it prints \( n-1 \).**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the list \( A \) is empty, the function should raise an error since the precondition states \( 1 \leq n \leq 100000 \). However, the provided code does not handle this case.
- If the list \( A \) contains only one element, the function correctly identifies that the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence is 1 and prints 0.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function should validate that \( n \) is within the specified range before proceeding. Currently, the function assumes that \( n \) is valid without checking.
- The function should handle the case where the list \( A \) contains duplicate elements. The current implementation of the function correctly identifies the longest strictly increasing subsequence but does not account for the fact that the output index could be misleading if there are duplicates. For example, if \( A = [1, 1, 2] \), the function would still print 1, which is incorrect since the first 1 is part of a duplicate sequence.
