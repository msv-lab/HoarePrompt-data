The `break` statement does not modify any variable values; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement that the `break` is part of, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is equal to infinity, `dp[i+1]` is not infinity, `i` is its original value plus 1**
