According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `dp[i]` is equal to infinity
- `dp[i+1]` is not infinity
- The if condition `dp[i] == float('inf')` is true, which means the loop continues.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

Since `dp[i+1]` is not infinity, this indicates that `dp[i+1]` is not `float('inf')`, and thus the if condition will evaluate to false for `i+1`, meaning the loop will stop at `i+1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i + 1`

The state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`dp[i]` is equal to infinity, `dp[i+1]` is not infinity, `i` is increased by 1**
