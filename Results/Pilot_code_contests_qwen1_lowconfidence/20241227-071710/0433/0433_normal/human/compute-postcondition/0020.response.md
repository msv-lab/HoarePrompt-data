The code `print(i)` prints the value of `i`. Since `i` was increased by 1 in the previous step, the value of `i` is now its original value plus 1. The states of the other variables (`dp[i]` and `dp[i+1]`) are not affected.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is equal to infinity, `dp[i+1]` is not infinity, `i` is its original value plus 1**
