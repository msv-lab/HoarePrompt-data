Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9 for each `i` where 0 ≤ i < n, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where the first k elements (k being the length of the unique sorted subsequence of `a`) are the sorted unique elements of `a`, and the rest are `float('inf')`, `i` is `n`**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. For each element `a[i]`, the `bisect_left` function finds the position in `dp` where `a[i]` can be inserted while maintaining the order. This means that `a[i]` will replace the `float('inf')` at that position in `dp`.
- Since `dp` initially contains `float('inf')` for all positions, the first unique element in `a` will be placed in the first position of `dp`, the second unique element in `a` will be placed in the second position of `dp`, and so on.
- The loop continues until all elements in `a` have been processed. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `dp` will contain the sorted unique elements of `a` in the first k positions, where k is the number of unique elements in `a`, and the rest of the elements in `dp` will still be `float('inf')`.
- The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`.
