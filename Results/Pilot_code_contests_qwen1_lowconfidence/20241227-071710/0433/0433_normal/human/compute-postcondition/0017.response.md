The code `break` does not change any variable values but breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Given that the initial state includes the print statement of `i`, it implies that `i` was intended to be printed before the break statement. However, since the break statement is executed, the print statement is not reached.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is equal to infinity, `dp[i+1]` is not infinity**
