The function accepts a list \( A \) of integers \( a_i \) where the length of the list is \( n \) such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100000 \), and each element \( a_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \). The function computes the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in the list \( A \) and prints the index of the first position where the dynamic programming array \( dp \) contains `float('inf')`. If all elements in \( dp \) are `float('inf')`, it prints \( n-1 \).
