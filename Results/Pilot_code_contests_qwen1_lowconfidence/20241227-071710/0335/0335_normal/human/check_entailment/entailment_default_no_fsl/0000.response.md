Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic for checking if a letter should be crossed out. According to the problem description, a letter should be crossed out if and only if the corresponding column or row contains at least one more letter that is exactly the same. However, the current implementation of `func_2` checks if the letter at position `(i, j)` is in the same row or the corresponding column (after transposing) and replaces the original character with `'_'` temporarily. This approach does not correctly identify repeated letters in the same row or column.

For example, consider the following input:

```
Input:
3 3
aab
aba
bba
```

The expected output is `"ab"`, but the current implementation would output an empty string because it incorrectly checks for the presence of `'_'` instead of counting the occurrences of the letter.

To fix this, the `func_2` function should count the occurrences of the letter in the row and column and only mark the letter for removal if it appears more than once. Here is a corrected version of `func_2`:

```python
def func_2(matrix, i, j):
    letter = matrix[i][j]
    # Count occurrences in the row and column
    row_count = matrix[i].count(letter)
    col_count = sum(1 for row in matrix for char in row if char == letter and (row.index(char), matrix.index(row)) != (j, i))
    # Check if the letter appears more than once in the row or column
    if row_count > 1 or col_count > 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

With this corrected function, the program should correctly identify and remove repeated letters in the same row or column, leading to the correct output.
