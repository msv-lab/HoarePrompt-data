You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An African crossword is a rectangular table n × m in size. Each cell of the table contains exactly one letter. This table (it is also referred to as grid) contains some encrypted word that needs to be decoded.

To solve the crossword you should cross out all repeated letters in rows and columns. In other words, a letter should only be crossed out if and only if the corresponding column or row contains at least one more letter that is exactly the same. Besides, all such letters are crossed out simultaneously.

When all repeated letters have been crossed out, we should write the remaining letters in a string. The letters that occupy a higher position follow before the letters that occupy a lower position. If the letters are located in one row, then the letter to the left goes first. The resulting word is the answer to the problem.

You are suggested to solve an African crossword and print the word encrypted there.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). Next n lines contain m lowercase Latin letters each. That is the crossword grid.

Output

Print the encrypted word on a single line. It is guaranteed that the answer consists of at least one letter.

    func_1()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, and matrix is a 2D list of strings where each string contains m lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1():
    n, m = list(map(int, raw_input('').split()))
    matrix = []
    selected_words = ''
    for i in range(n):
        letters = raw_input('')
        
        row = []
        
        for letter in letters:
            row.append(letter)
        
        matrix.append(row)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters read from `raw_input` calls, `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if not func_2(matrix, i, j):
                selected_words += matrix[i][j]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the rows of `matrix` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False` for all \(0 \leq j < m\) in every row `i` for which `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` evaluates to `True` for at least one \(j\), and `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration.
    print(selected_words)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m`, representing the dimensions of a 2D list `matrix` where each row contains `m` lowercase Latin letters. The function iterates over each element in the matrix and constructs a string `selected_words` by concatenating characters from the matrix based on the result of calling `func_2(matrix, i, j)` for each element. Specifically, if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, the character at position `(i, j)` is added to `selected_words`. After processing all elements, the function prints `selected_words`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a 2D list of characters representing the crossword grid, i and j are integers such that 0 <= i < len(matrix) and 0 <= j < len(matrix[0]), and the function is called for each cell in the matrix to determine if the letter at that cell should be crossed out.
def func_2(matrix, i, j):
    letter = matrix[i][j]
    matrix[i][j] = '_'
    result = letter in matrix[i] or letter in zip(*matrix)[j]
    matrix[i][j] = letter
    return result
    #The program returns result which is either True or False depending on whether '_' is found in matrix[i] or zip(*matrix)[j]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a 2D list `matrix` and two integers `i` and `j`, representing the row and column indices of a cell in the matrix. It checks whether the character at position `(i, j)` or the character at position `(j, i)` in the transposed matrix is `'_'`. If either condition is true, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. After the function executes, the original character at position `(i, j)` in the matrix is temporarily replaced with `'_'` and then restored to its original value. The function does not handle edge cases where the matrix is empty or indices are out of bounds, but it ensures that the character at the specified position is checked in both the original and transposed matrix for the presence of `'_'`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
