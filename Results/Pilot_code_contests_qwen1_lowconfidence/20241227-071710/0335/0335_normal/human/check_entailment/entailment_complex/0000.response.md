Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not fully implement the logic required to solve the African crossword problem as described. Specifically, the function `func_2` checks for the presence of a letter in its own row and column but does not ensure that the letter is crossed out if it appears multiple times. Instead, it only checks if the letter is present at least once in either the row or the column, which does not correctly implement the requirement to cross out all repeated letters simultaneously.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
abc
bca
cba
```

According to the problem description, the expected output should be:

```
abc
```

However, the current implementation would produce:

```
abca
```

This happens because the function `func_2` allows the letter 'a' to be included twice since it is present in the first row and the third column, even though it is repeated in the first row. Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the logic to cross out all repeated letters, leading to an incorrect solution.
