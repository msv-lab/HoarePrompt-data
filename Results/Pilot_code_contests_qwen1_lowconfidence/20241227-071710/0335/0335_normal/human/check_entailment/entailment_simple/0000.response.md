Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads `n` lines of input, each containing `m` lowercase Latin letters, and stores them in a 2D list `matrix`.

2. **Removing Repeated Letters:**
   - For each cell `(i, j)` in the matrix, the program checks if the letter at this position should be crossed out using the function `func_2`.
   - The function `func_2` determines if a letter should be removed by checking if the letter appears again in the same row or column.
   - If a letter is not to be removed (i.e., `func_2` returns `False`), it is added to the `selected_words` string.

3. **Constructing the Result:**
   - After processing all cells, the program prints the `selected_words` string, which contains the letters that remain after removing duplicates in rows and columns.

4. **Function Implementation:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly checks if a letter should be removed by ensuring the letter appears elsewhere in its row or column.
   - It temporarily replaces the letter with `_` to avoid counting it multiple times during the check.

The program handles all the required steps and conditions accurately as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
