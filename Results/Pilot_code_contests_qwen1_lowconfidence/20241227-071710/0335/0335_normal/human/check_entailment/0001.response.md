Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the African crossword problem. Specifically, the function `func_2` checks if a letter appears again in its row or column, but it does not handle the simultaneous crossing out of all repeated letters properly. 

For instance, consider the following input:

Input:
```
3 3
aba
bab
aba
```

The expected output is `"ab"`, but the current implementation will incorrectly output an empty string because it does not cross out both instances of 'a' in the first and third rows simultaneously.

The issue arises because `func_2` only checks if the letter appears again in the row or column and does not ensure that all repeated letters are removed at once. To fix this, you would need to keep track of which letters have already been marked for removal and remove them after checking all rows and columns.
