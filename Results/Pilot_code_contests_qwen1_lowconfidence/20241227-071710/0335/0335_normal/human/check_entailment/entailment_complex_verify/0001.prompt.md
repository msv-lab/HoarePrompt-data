You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An African crossword is a rectangular table n × m in size. Each cell of the table contains exactly one letter. This table (it is also referred to as grid) contains some encrypted word that needs to be decoded.

To solve the crossword you should cross out all repeated letters in rows and columns. In other words, a letter should only be crossed out if and only if the corresponding column or row contains at least one more letter that is exactly the same. Besides, all such letters are crossed out simultaneously.

When all repeated letters have been crossed out, we should write the remaining letters in a string. The letters that occupy a higher position follow before the letters that occupy a lower position. If the letters are located in one row, then the letter to the left goes first. The resulting word is the answer to the problem.

You are suggested to solve an African crossword and print the word encrypted there.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). Next n lines contain m lowercase Latin letters each. That is the crossword grid.

Output

Print the encrypted word on a single line. It is guaranteed that the answer consists of at least one letter.

Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, m) = list(map(int, raw_input('').split()))
    matrix = []
    selected_words = ''
    for i in range(n):
        letters = raw_input('')
        row = []
        for letter in letters:
            row.append(letter)
        matrix.append(row)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if not func_2(matrix, i, j):
                selected_words += matrix[i][j]
    print(selected_words)

#Function 2:
def func_2(matrix, i, j):
    letter = matrix[i][j]
    matrix[i][j] = '_'
    result = letter in matrix[i] or letter in zip(*matrix)[j]
    matrix[i][j] = letter
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the African crossword problem. Specifically, the function `func_2` checks if a letter appears again in its row or column, but it does not handle the simultaneous crossing out of all repeated letters properly. 

For instance, consider the following input:

Input:
```
3 3
aba
bab
aba
```

The expected output is `"ab"`, but the current implementation will incorrectly output an empty string because it does not cross out both instances of 'a' in the first and third rows simultaneously.

The issue arises because `func_2` only checks if the letter appears again in the row or column and does not ensure that all repeated letters are removed at once. To fix this, you would need to keep track of which letters have already been marked for removal and remove them after checking all rows and columns.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, and matrix is a 2D list of strings where each string contains m lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1():
    n, m = list(map(int, raw_input('').split()))
    matrix = []
    selected_words = ''
    for i in range(n):
        letters = raw_input('')
        
        row = []
        
        for letter in letters:
            row.append(letter)
        
        matrix.append(row)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters read from `raw_input` calls, `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if not func_2(matrix, i, j):
                selected_words += matrix[i][j]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the rows of `matrix` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False` for all \(0 \leq j < m\) in every row `i` for which `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` evaluates to `True` for at least one \(j\), and `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration.
    print(selected_words)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m`, representing the dimensions of a 2D list `matrix` where each row contains `m` lowercase Latin letters. The function iterates over each element in the matrix and constructs a string `selected_words` by concatenating characters from the matrix based on the result of calling `func_2(matrix, i, j)` for each element. Specifically, if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, the character at position `(i, j)` is added to `selected_words`. After processing all elements, the function prints `selected_words`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a 2D list of characters representing the crossword grid, i and j are integers such that 0 <= i < len(matrix) and 0 <= j < len(matrix[0]), and the function is called for each cell in the matrix to determine if the letter at that cell should be crossed out.
def func_2(matrix, i, j):
    letter = matrix[i][j]
    matrix[i][j] = '_'
    result = letter in matrix[i] or letter in zip(*matrix)[j]
    matrix[i][j] = letter
    return result
    #The program returns result which is either True or False depending on whether '_' is found in matrix[i] or zip(*matrix)[j]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a 2D list `matrix` and two integers `i` and `j`, representing the row and column indices of a cell in the matrix. It checks whether the character at position `(i, j)` or the character at position `(j, i)` in the transposed matrix is `'_'`. If either condition is true, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. After the function executes, the original character at position `(i, j)` in the matrix is temporarily replaced with `'_'` and then restored to its original value. The function does not handle edge cases where the matrix is empty or indices are out of bounds, but it ensures that the character at the specified position is checked in both the original and transposed matrix for the presence of `'_'`.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
