Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_2` only checks if a letter appears again in its row or column without ensuring that all repeated letters are removed at once. This means that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the African crossword problem as described.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 3
aba
bab
aba
```

The expected output is `"ab"`, but the current implementation will incorrectly output an empty string because it does not cross out both instances of 'a' in the first and third rows simultaneously. The annotations also confirm that the function `func_2` does not maintain the state of the matrix to ensure that all repeated letters are crossed out together.

Therefore, the original assessment remains correct, and the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
