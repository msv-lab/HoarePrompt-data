Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to cross out all repeated letters in rows and columns. According to the problem description, a letter should be crossed out if and only if the corresponding column or row contains at least one more letter that is exactly the same. However, the function `func_2` checks if the character at position `(i, j)` is present in the same row or column after replacing it with `'_'`. This is incorrect because it does not ensure that the character is repeated in the same row or column after considering all characters in the row and column.

For example, consider the following input:

```
Input:
3 3
aba
bcb
aba
```

The expected output is `abc`, but the current implementation would incorrectly output `abab`.

To fix this, the function `func_2` should check if the character is repeated in the same row or column without modifying the matrix temporarily. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_2(matrix, i, j):
    letter = matrix[i][j]
    # Check if the letter is repeated in the same row
    if matrix[i].count(letter) > 1:
        return True
    # Check if the letter is repeated in the same column
    col = [matrix[k][j] for k in range(len(matrix))]
    if col.count(letter) > 1:
        return True
    return False
```

This corrected function should accurately implement the logic required to solve the problem.
