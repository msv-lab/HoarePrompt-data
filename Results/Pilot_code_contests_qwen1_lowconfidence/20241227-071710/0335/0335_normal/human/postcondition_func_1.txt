The function `func_2` accepts a 2D list `matrix` and two integers `i` and `j`, representing the row and column indices of a cell in the matrix. It checks whether the character at position `(i, j)` or the character at position `(j, i)` in the transposed matrix is `'_'`. If either condition is true, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. After the function executes, the original character at position `(i, j)` in the matrix is temporarily replaced with `'_'` and then restored to its original value. The function does not handle edge cases where the matrix is empty or indices are out of bounds, but it ensures that the character at the specified position is checked in both the original and transposed matrix for the presence of `'_'`.
