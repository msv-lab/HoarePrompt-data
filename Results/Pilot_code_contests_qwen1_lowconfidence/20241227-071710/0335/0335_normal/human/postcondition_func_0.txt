The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m`, representing the dimensions of a 2D list `matrix` where each row contains `m` lowercase Latin letters. The function iterates over each element in the matrix and constructs a string `selected_words` by concatenating characters from the matrix based on the result of calling `func_2(matrix, i, j)` for each element. Specifically, if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, the character at position `(i, j)` is added to `selected_words`. After processing all elements, the function prints `selected_words`.
