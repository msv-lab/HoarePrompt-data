The code `row.append(letter)` appends the value of `letter` to the list `row`. Given the initial state:
- `letters` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is the length of the original `letters` + 1.
- `matrix` is a list containing one element which is the list `row` (containing the next character of the new `letters`).
- `selected_words` is an empty string.
- `row` is a list containing one character (`letter`).

After executing `row.append(letter)`, the list `row` will now contain two characters: the first character from the initial state and the new `letter`.

Output State: **`letters` is a non-empty string, `i` is len(`letters`) + 1, `matrix` is a list containing the list `row` (now containing two characters), `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is a list containing two characters (`letter` and the next character of `letters`).**
