The code `row.append(letter)` appends the character `letter` to the list `row`. From the initial state, `letters` is a non-empty string, `i` is the length of the original `letters` + 1, `matrix` is a list containing one element which is the list `row` (containing all the characters in the new `letters`), `selected_words` is an empty string, and `row` is an empty list.

Since `letter` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is a single character from the string `letters`. After appending `letter` to `row`, `row` will contain at least one character.

Output State: **`letters` is a non-empty string, `i` is the length of the original `letters` + 1, `matrix` is a list containing one element which is the list `row` (containing the first character of the new `letters`), `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is a list containing one character (`letter`).**
