The code assigns the character at the position (i, j) in the matrix to the variable `letter`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the value of `matrix` remains unchanged, and `i` and `j` remain the same, while `letter` now holds the character from the matrix at the specified position.

Output State: **matrix is a 2D list of characters, `i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(matrix), `j` is an integer such that 0 <= j < len(matrix[0]), and `letter` is the character at matrix[i][j]**
