The code snippet `selected_words += matrix[i][j]` adds the character at position \((i, j)\) in the matrix to the `selected_words` string. Given the initial conditions, `selected_words` is constructed by concatenating characters from the \((i+1)-th\) row of `matrix` for all \(0 \leq j < m\) under the condition that `(not func_2(matrix, i, j))` is `True`. Since the condition is true for the current value of `j`, the character from the \((i+1)-th\) row at column `j` is added to `selected_words`.

After executing this line, `selected_words` will include one additional character from the specified row.

Output State: **`j` is an integer less than `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` is greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, and `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)-th\) row of `matrix` for all \(0 \leq j < m\) provided that `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` evaluates to `True` for each such \(j\); additionally, `selected_words` is updated to include the character from the \((i+1)-th\) row at column `j`.**
