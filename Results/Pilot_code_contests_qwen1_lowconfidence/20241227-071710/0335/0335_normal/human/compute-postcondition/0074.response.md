The code prints the value of `selected_words`. The value of `selected_words` is determined by the function `func_2(matrix, i, j)` but the code does not change the value of `selected_words`. Therefore, the only change is the print statement which outputs the current value of `selected_words`.

Output State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, `selected_words` is printed, and `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration.**
