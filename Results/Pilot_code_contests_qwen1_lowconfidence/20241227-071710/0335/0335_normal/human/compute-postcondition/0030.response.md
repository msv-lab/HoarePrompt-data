Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `letters` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is `len(letters) + 2`.
- `matrix` is `[[], []]` with the first element now being `[letter]`.
- `selected_words` is an empty string.
- `row` is `[letter]`.

### Loop Condition
The for loop iterates over each character in the `letters` string:
```python
for letter in letters:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the `letters` string.
2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `len(letters) + 2`.
   - Since `i` is `len(letters) + 2`, and `letters` is non-empty, `i` is greater than 2 (the minimum length of `letters` plus 2).
   - The first element of `matrix` is `[letter]`.
   - `selected_words` is still an empty string.
   - `row` is `[letter]`.

### Next Iteration
For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

- The loop will continue as long as `letters` is non-empty.
- After the current iteration, `letter` will be the next character in `letters`.
- `i` will remain `len(letters) + 2` because it was not modified within the loop body.
- `matrix` will have its first element updated to include the new `letter`.
- `selected_words` will remain an empty string unless modified within the loop body.
- `row` will be updated to include the new `letter`.

### Updated States
- `letters` will have one less character.
- `matrix`'s first element will be updated to include the new `letter`.
- `row` will be updated to include the new `letter`.

### Final State for the Next Iteration
- `letters` will be a non-empty string minus one character.
- `i` remains `len(letters) + 2`.
- The first element of `matrix` will be updated to include the new `letter`.
- `selected_words` remains an empty string.
- `row` will be updated to include the new `letter`.

### Conclusion
State: **`letters` is a non-empty string minus one character, `i` is `len(letters) + 2`, the first element of `matrix` is updated to include the new `letter`, `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is updated to include the new `letter`**.

This ensures that the loop can continue executing with the updated state.
