Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `m` must be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 100\).
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters.
   - `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)\)-th row of `matrix` where `func_2(matrix, i+1, j)` returns `False` for all \(0 \leq j < m\).
   - `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed:**
   - The variable `j` starts at `m` (as given in the initial state). However, since the loop runs from `0` to `m-1`, `j` should start from `0` to ensure the loop executes properly.
   - `m` is already stated as a positive integer within the specified range.
   - `n` is already stated as greater than 0.
   - `matrix` is already defined as a list of lists of characters with `n` rows.
   - `selected_words` is defined based on the condition that `func_2(matrix, i+1, j)` returns `False` for all \(0 \leq j < m\). Since `j` will be iterated from `0` to `m-1`, this condition ensures `selected_words` is correctly formed.
   - `row` is read from `raw_input` during each iteration of the loop, but its initial state is not relevant for the loop's execution.

3. **Adjust the States for the Loop to Execute:**
   - To ensure the loop starts correctly, `j` must be adjusted to start from `0` instead of `m`.

Given these considerations, the final state needed for the loop to execute is:

State: **`j` is 0, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` must be greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)-th` row of `matrix` where `func_2(matrix, i+1, j)` returns `False` for all \(0 \leq j < m\)**
