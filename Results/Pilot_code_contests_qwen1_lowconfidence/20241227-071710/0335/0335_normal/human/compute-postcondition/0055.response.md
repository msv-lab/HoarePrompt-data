The code snippet `selected_words += matrix[i][j]` updates the `selected_words` string by appending the character from the `i+1`-th row of the `matrix` at the position `j`. Given that `i+1` is effectively `i` (since `i` starts from 0), the code appends the character at `matrix[i][j]` to `selected_words`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `i` is not directly affected by this line of code.
- `j` is not directly affected by this line of code.
- `m` is not directly affected by this line of code.
- `n` is not directly affected by this line of code.
- `matrix` remains unchanged.
- `selected_words` is updated by adding the character from `matrix[i][j]`.

Since `func_2(matrix, i+1, j)` returns `False` for all \(0 \leq j < m\), it means `selected_words` contains characters from the `i+1`-th row of the `matrix` for all columns up to `j`.

Therefore, the `selected_words` now includes the additional character from `matrix[i][j]`.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` is greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)-th\) row of `matrix` for all \(0 \leq j < 1\) plus the character `matrix[i][1]`**
