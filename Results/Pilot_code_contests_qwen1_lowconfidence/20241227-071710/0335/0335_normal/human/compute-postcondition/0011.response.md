The code `row.append(letter)` appends the value of `letter` to the list `row`. Initially, `row` is a list containing the elements `letter, letter`. After appending `letter`, the list `row` will contain three occurrences of `letter`.

Output State: **`letters` is a non-empty string, `i` is 2, `matrix` is an empty list, `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is a list containing the elements `letter, letter, letter`**
