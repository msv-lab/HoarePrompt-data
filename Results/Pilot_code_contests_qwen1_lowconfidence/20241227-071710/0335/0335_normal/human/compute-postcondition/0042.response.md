According to the given code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were true:
- `j` is 0
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters
- `selected_words` is a string with the first character of the `i-th` row of `matrix` appended to it
- `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration
- The function `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`. Since `j` starts at 0 and is incremented within the loop, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `j` is 1
- `m` remains the same (still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100)
- `n` remains the same (still greater than 0)
- `matrix` remains the same (still a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters)
- `selected_words` remains the same (still a string with the first character of the `i-th` row of `matrix` appended to it)
- `row` remains the same (still a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration)
- The function `func_2(matrix, i, j)` still returns False (since the value returned by `func_2` does not change with `j`)

State: **`j` is 1, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100, `n` must be greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, `selected_words` is a string with the first character of the `i-th` row of `matrix` appended to it, `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration, and the function `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False.**
