Output State: **`letters` is an empty string, `i` is 2, `matrix` is `[[], []]` with the first element being a list containing all the characters of the original `letters` string in the order they appeared, `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is a list containing all the characters of the original `letters` string.**

### Explanation:
- **`letters`**: Initially, `letters` is a non-empty string provided by the user. As the loop iterates, each character in `letters` is appended to the `row` list, and the `letters` string becomes progressively shorter until it is empty.
- **`i`**: `i` is initialized as the length of `letters` plus 2. Since `letters` eventually becomes an empty string, `i` remains as `len(letters) + 2` which simplifies to 2 when `letters` is empty.
- **`matrix`**: The `matrix` starts as `[[], []]`. Each iteration of the loop appends the current character from `letters` to the first element of `matrix`. After the loop completes, the first element of `matrix` will contain all the characters of the original `letters` string in the order they appeared.
- **`selected_words`**: This variable is never modified within the loop and remains an empty string throughout the execution.
- **`row`**: The `row` list starts as an empty list and collects all the characters from `letters` during the loop. Once `letters` is empty, `row` contains all the characters of the original `letters` string in the order they appeared.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `letters` will be an empty string, `i` will be 2, the first element of `matrix` will contain all the characters of the original `letters` string, `selected_words` will remain empty, and `row` will also contain all the characters of the original `letters` string.
