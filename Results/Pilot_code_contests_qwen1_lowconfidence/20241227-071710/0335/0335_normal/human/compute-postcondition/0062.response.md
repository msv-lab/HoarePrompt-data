State: **`j` is `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` is greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, and `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)-th\) row of `matrix` for all \(0 \leq j < m\) provided that `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` evaluates to `True` for each such \(j\), `j` must be less than `m`**

Explanation:
- The loop `for j in range(m):` will iterate over values of `j` starting from 0 up to `m-1`.
- For the loop to execute, the initial value of `j` must be 0 (or less than `m`) because `range(m)` will generate values from 0 to `m-1`.
- Therefore, we need to adjust the initial state of `j` to be less than `m`.

So, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted to ensure that `j` is within the valid range for the loop to execute.
