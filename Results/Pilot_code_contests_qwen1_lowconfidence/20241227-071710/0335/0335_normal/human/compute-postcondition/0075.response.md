The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\). The function also accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a 2D list of strings where each string contains `m` lowercase Latin letters. 

The output of the function is not specified in the given information, but based on the parameters, it suggests that the function might be processing or analyzing the `matrix` in some way related to its dimensions `n` and `m`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `m` and a 2D list of strings `matrix`, where each string in the list has `m` lowercase Latin letters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` and a 2D list of strings `matrix`, where each string in the list has `m` lowercase Latin letters.**
