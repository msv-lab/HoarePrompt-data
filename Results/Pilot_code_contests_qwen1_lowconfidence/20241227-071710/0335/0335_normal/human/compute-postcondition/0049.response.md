Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is equal to `m`.
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\).
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters.
   - `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the `i-th` row of `matrix` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False for all \(0 \leq j < m\).
   - `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration.
   - The function `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False for all \(0 \leq j < m\).

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning it goes through each row of the matrix.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current row being processed.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is currently the last row processed (because `j` equals `m` and `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returned False for all columns up to `m`), the next iteration would start with `i` incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be set to `i + 1` for the next iteration.
   - `j` should remain equal to `m` as it was already checked for all columns up to `m`.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is a constant defined in the problem.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is also a constant defined in the problem.
   - `matrix` remains unchanged as no new rows or changes to existing rows are mentioned.
   - `selected_words` remains unchanged as it was constructed based on the previous row and conditions, and there's no indication that this needs to be updated unless a new row is processed.
   - `row` is not mentioned in the context of the loop continuation, so it remains as it was read from `raw_input` in the previous iteration.

5. **Final State:**
   - The new state for the next iteration will be with `i` incremented by 1, while keeping all other variables the same.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` must be greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the `(i+1)-th` row of `matrix` where `func_2(matrix, i+1, j)` returns False for all \(0 \leq j < m\), and `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration.**
