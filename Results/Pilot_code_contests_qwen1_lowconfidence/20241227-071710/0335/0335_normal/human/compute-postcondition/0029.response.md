The code snippet `row.append(letter)` appends the character `letter` to the list `row`. Since `letter` is not defined in the initial state, we will consider it as a single character from the string `letters`.

Here are the steps:

1. `letters` is a non-empty string.
2. `i` is calculated as `len(letters) + 2`.
3. `matrix` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the list `row`, which is initially an empty list.
4. `selected_words` is an empty string.
5. `row` is an empty list.

After executing `row.append(letter)`, the character `letter` is appended to the list `row`.

Output State: **`letters` is a non-empty string; `i` is `len(letters) + 2`; `matrix` is `[[], []]` with the first element now being `[letter]`; `selected_words` is an empty string; `row` is `[letter]`**
