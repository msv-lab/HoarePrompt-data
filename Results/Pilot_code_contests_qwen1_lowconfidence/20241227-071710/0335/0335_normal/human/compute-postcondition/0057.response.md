According to the given for loop and the initial state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine how the loop condition affects the variables involved. The loop runs for `j` in the range of `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` is greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, and `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)-th\) row of `matrix` for all \(0 \leq j < 1\) plus the character `matrix[i][1]`, provided that `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` evaluates to `True`. Otherwise, `selected_words` remains unchanged.

Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial Values**: 
   - `j` is 1 (the previous value)
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\)
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `matrix` is a list of lists of characters
   - `selected_words` is determined based on certain conditions involving `func_2` and the matrix.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range of `m`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `j` was 1 in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - `m` remains the same as it was not modified by the loop itself.
   - `n` remains the same as it was not modified by the loop itself.
   - `matrix` remains the same as it was not modified by the loop itself.
   - `selected_words` may or may not change depending on the outcome of `func_2(matrix, i, j)`. However, since the loop is about to execute again, we assume the condition for updating `selected_words` has not been met (otherwise, it would have updated `selected_words` in the previous iteration).

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 2, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` is greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, and `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)-th\) row of `matrix` for all \(0 \leq j < 1\) plus the character `matrix[i][1]`, provided that `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` evaluates to `True`. Otherwise, `selected_words` remains unchanged.**
