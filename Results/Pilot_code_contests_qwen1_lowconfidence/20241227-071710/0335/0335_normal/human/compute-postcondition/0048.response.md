Output State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` must be greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the `i-th` row of `matrix` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False for all \(0 \leq j < m\), `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration, and the function `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False for all \(0 \leq j < m\).**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for \(m\) iterations, as specified by the range `range(m)`.
- During each iteration, the condition `if not func_2(matrix, i, j):` checks whether the function `func_2` returns `False` for the given indices `i` and `j`.
- If the condition is true (i.e., `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`), the character `matrix[i][j]` is appended to `selected_words`.
- After all \(m\) iterations, `j` will be equal to `m`, and `selected_words` will contain all characters from the `i-th` row of `matrix` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returned `False` for all \(0 \leq j < m\).

If the loop does not execute (i.e., \(m = 0\)):
- `j` will still be `0` (as per the initial state).
- `m` will be \(0\).
- `n` must be greater than \(0\).
- `matrix` will be a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters.
- `selected_words` will remain an empty string.
- `row` will be a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration, but since the loop does not execute, no characters will be appended to `selected_words`.

Thus, the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished is as described above.
