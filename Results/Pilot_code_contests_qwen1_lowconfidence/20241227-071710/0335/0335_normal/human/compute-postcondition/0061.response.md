According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` is greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, and `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)-th\) row of `matrix` under certain conditions.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` was previously set to `m-1` (as `j` is `m` and it represents the column index), `i` needs to be incremented to `m`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is incremented by 1 to become `m + 1` and `n` must remain greater than 0.

State: **`j` is `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` is greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, and `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)-th\) row of `matrix` for all \(0 \leq j < m\) provided that `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` evaluates to `True` for each such \(j\)**. 

However, since `i` is now `m`, the next value of `i` should be `m + 1`.

State: **`j` is `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` is greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, and `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)-th\) row of `matrix` for all \(0 \leq j < m\) provided that `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` evaluates to `True` for each such \(j\), where `i` is now `m + 1`.
