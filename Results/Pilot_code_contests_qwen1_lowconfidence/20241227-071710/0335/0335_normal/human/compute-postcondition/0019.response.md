Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `letters` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is the length of the original `letters` + 1.
   - `matrix` is a list containing one element which is the list `row` (containing the first character of the new `letters`).
   - `selected_words` is an empty string.
   - `row` is a list containing one character (`letter`).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in `letters`.
   - For each iteration, `letter` is taken from `letters`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` remains the same as it was incremented after the previous iteration but before the current one started.
   - `matrix` still contains one element which is the list `row` (containing the first character of the new `letters`).
   - `selected_words` remains an empty string because no words were selected yet.
   - `row` now contains the character that was just processed in the loop.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - To continue the loop, the next character from `letters` needs to be considered.
   - Therefore, `letter` will be the next character in `letters`.
   - `i` will remain unchanged since it is based on the original length of `letters` and does not change within the loop.
   - `matrix` will still contain one element which is the list `row` (containing the next character of the new `letters`).
   - `selected_words` will still be an empty string since no words have been selected yet.
   - `row` will be updated to contain the next character from `letters`.

5. **Adjusted States**:
   - `letters` remains the same.
   - `i` remains the length of the original `letters` + 1.
   - `matrix` contains one element which is the list `row` (containing the next character of the new `letters`).
   - `selected_words` remains an empty string.
   - `row` contains the next character from `letters`.

So, the states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`letters` is a non-empty string, `i` is the length of the original `letters` + 1, `matrix` is a list containing one element which is the list `row` (containing the next character of the new `letters`), `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is a list containing one character (`letter`).**
