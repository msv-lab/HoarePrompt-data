`matrix.append(row)` appends the list `row` to the list `matrix`. Since `row` is a list containing all the elements of `letters`, and `letters` is a non-empty string, `row` is a list containing all the characters in `letters`. The lengths of `letters` and `row` are the same, which is the value of `i`.

After executing the code, `matrix` will contain one element, which is the list `row`. The values of `letters`, `i`, `selected_words`, and `row` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`letters` is a non-empty string, `i` is the length of `letters`, `matrix` is a list containing one element which is the list `row` (containing all the characters in `letters`), `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is a list containing all the elements of `letters`.**
