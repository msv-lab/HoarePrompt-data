The code `selected_words += matrix[i][j]` appends the character at `matrix[i][j]` to the string `selected_words`. The initial conditions state that `selected_words` contains all characters from the \((i+1)\)-th row of `matrix` for all \(0 \leq j < m\) where `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` is `True`.

Since the code only modifies `selected_words` and does not affect any other variables, and considering that `func_2(matrix, i, j)` remains unchanged, the condition for including characters in `selected_words` still holds. Thus, after executing the line, `selected_words` will include the character at `matrix[i][j]` added to its current value.

Output State: **`j` is an integer less than `m` (i.e., `j + 1`), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` is greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, and `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)\)-th row of `matrix` for all \(0 \leq j < m\) provided that `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` evaluates to `True` for each such \(j\); `selected_words` includes the character at `matrix[i][j]` added to its previous value.**
