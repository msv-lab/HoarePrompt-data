Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m`, representing the dimensions of a 2D list `matrix` where each row contains `m` lowercase Latin letters. The function iterates over each element in the matrix and constructs a string `selected_words` by concatenating characters from the matrix based on the result of calling `func_2(matrix, i, j)` for each element. Specifically, if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, the character at position `(i, j)` is added to `selected_words`. After processing all elements, the function prints `selected_words`.**

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `func_2(matrix, i, j)` is never called (which could happen if `n` or `m` is zero, though the problem statement specifies they are positive integers), `selected_words` will remain an empty string.
- The function assumes that `func_2` will always return a boolean value, but no specific behavior is defined for non-boolean return values. If `func_2` returns a non-boolean value, the function will attempt to concatenate it with `selected_words`, which may not be intended.
- The function does not handle the case where `func_2` might throw an exception. If `func_2` encounters an error or raises an exception, the function will terminate abruptly without printing anything.
