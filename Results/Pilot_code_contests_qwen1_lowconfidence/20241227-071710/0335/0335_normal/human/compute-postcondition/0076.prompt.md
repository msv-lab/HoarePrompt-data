You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, and matrix is a 2D list of strings where each string contains m lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1():
    n, m = list(map(int, raw_input('').split()))
    matrix = []
    selected_words = ''
    for i in range(n):
        letters = raw_input('')
        
        row = []
        
        for letter in letters:
            row.append(letter)
        
        matrix.append(row)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters read from `raw_input` calls, `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if not func_2(matrix, i, j):
                selected_words += matrix[i][j]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the rows of `matrix` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False` for all \(0 \leq j < m\) in every row `i` for which `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` evaluates to `True` for at least one \(j\), and `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration.
    print(selected_words)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` and a 2D list of strings `matrix`, where each string in the list has `m` lowercase Latin letters.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
