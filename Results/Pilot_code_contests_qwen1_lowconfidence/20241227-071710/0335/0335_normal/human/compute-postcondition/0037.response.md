According to the given code snippet, the loop will iterate over the range defined by `n`. For the loop to execute, the variable `n` must be at least 1. The initial values of `m`, `matrix`, `selected_words`, and `row` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute, as they are only used within the loop body.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `n`:** The loop will iterate from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
2. **Variable `m`:** Since `m` is a positive integer and does not influence the loop condition, no adjustment is needed for `m`.
3. **Variable `matrix`:** This is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters. The existence and structure of this matrix do not directly affect the loop condition.
4. **Variable `selected_words`:** This is an empty string and is used within the loop but does not impact the loop's execution.
5. **Variable `row`:** This is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration. It is used within the loop but does not affect the loop condition.

Given these points, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters read from `raw_input` calls, `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration**.
