Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` must be greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, `selected_words` is the original string with the second character of the `i-th` row of `matrix` appended to it, `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration, and the function `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False. After the execution of the if-else block, `selected_words` is updated by appending `matrix[i][2]` to its current value.***
