The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `matrix`, `i`, and `j`. 

- `matrix` is a 2D list of characters representing the crossword grid.
- `i` and `j` are integers such that `0 <= i < len(matrix)` and `0 <= j < len(matrix[0])`.

The function is called for each cell in the matrix to determine if the letter at that cell should be crossed out.

The function returns `result`, which is either `True` or `False` depending on whether `'_'` is found in `matrix[i]` or `zip(*matrix)[j]`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a 2D list `matrix` and two integers `i` and `j`, and return `True` if the character at position `(i, j)` in the matrix or the character at position `(j, i)` in the transposed matrix (obtained using `zip(*matrix)`) is `'_'`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a 2D list `matrix` and two integers `i` and `j`, and returns `True` if the character at position `(i, j)` in the matrix or the character at position `(j, i)` in the transposed matrix is `'_'`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.**
