According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the function `func_2(matrix, i, j)`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `m` and the condition `(not func_2(matrix, i, j))` is true.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` is 0
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\)
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters
- `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)-th\) row of `matrix` where `func_2(matrix, i+1, j)` returns `False` for all \(0 \leq j < m\)

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.
- The condition `(not func_2(matrix, i, j))` must still be true for the loop to continue. Since we don't know the exact value of `func_2(matrix, i, j)`, we only know it must be false for the loop to continue. 

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `j` is 1
- `m` remains the same (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\))
- `n` remains the same (greater than 0)
- `matrix` remains the same (a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters)
- `selected_words` remains the same (a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)-th\) row of `matrix` where `func_2(matrix, i+1, j)` returns `False` for all \(0 \leq j < m\))

State: **`j` is 1, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` is greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)-th\) row of `matrix` where `func_2(matrix, i+1, j)` returns `False` for all \(0 \leq j < m\)**
