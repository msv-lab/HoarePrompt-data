The code appends the list `row` to the list `matrix`. Given the initial state:

- `letters` is a non-empty string
- `i` is the length of the original `letters` + 1
- `matrix` is a list containing one element which is the list `row` (containing all the characters of the new `letters`)
- `selected_words` is an empty string
- `row` is a list containing all the characters of `letters`

After executing `matrix.append(row)`, the list `matrix` will now contain two elements: the original `row` and the new `row` appended to it.

Output State: **`letters` is a non-empty string, `i` is the length of the original `letters` + 1, `matrix` is a list containing two elements which are both the list `row` (containing all the characters of `letters`), `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is a list containing all the characters of `letters`.**
