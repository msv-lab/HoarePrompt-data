The code `row.append(letter)` appends the value of `letter` to the list `row`. Given the initial state where `row` is a list containing the element `letter`, after appending `letter` again, `row` will contain two elements: `letter` and `letter`.

Output State: **`letters` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, `matrix` is an empty list, `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is a list containing the elements `letter, letter`**
