Output State: **`letters` is a non-empty string, `i` is the length of `letters`, `matrix` is an empty list, `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is a list containing all the elements of `letters`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `letters`.
- Each iteration appends the current character to the list `row`.
- After the loop completes, `row` will contain all the characters from `letters`.
- The value of `i` will be the length of the string `letters` because `i` is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.
- Since the loop does not modify `matrix` or `selected_words`, they remain empty lists and an empty string respectively.
- The initial value of `i` being 0 and the incrementation within the loop ensure that `i` ends up being the length of `letters` after the loop finishes.
