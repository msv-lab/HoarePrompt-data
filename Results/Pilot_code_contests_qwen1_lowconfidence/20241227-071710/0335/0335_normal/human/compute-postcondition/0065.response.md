Postcondition: ***`j` is an integer less than `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` is greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, and `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)\-th\) row of `matrix` for all \(0 \leq j < m\) provided that `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` evaluates to `True` for each such \(j\); additionally, if `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` is `True`, `selected_words` is updated to include the character from the \((i+1)\-th\) row at column `j`.***
