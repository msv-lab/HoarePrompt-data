The code `matrix.append(row)` appends the `row` list to the `matrix` list. The initial state is that `matrix` is `[[], []]` and `row` is a list containing all the characters of the original `letters` string. Since `letters` is an empty string, `row` is also an empty list `[]`.

After executing `matrix.append(row)`, the `row` list, which is an empty list, is appended to `matrix`. Thus, the updated `matrix` will be `[[], [], []]`.

Output State: **`letters` is an empty string, `i` is 2, `matrix` is `[[], [], []]`, `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is an empty list `[]`.**
