The code `row.append(letter)` appends the value of `letter` to the list `row`. Based on the initial state, `row` is already updated to include a new letter and has a length of `len(letters) + 2`. However, since `row.append(letter)` is executed, the length of `row` will increase by 1.

- `letters` remains a non-empty string minus two characters.
- `i` remains `len(letters) + 2`.
- The first element of `matrix` is updated to include the new `letter`.
- `selected_words` remains an empty string.
- After executing `row.append(letter)`, the length of `row` is now `len(letters) + 3`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `letters` is a non-empty string minus two characters, `i` is `len(letters) + 2`, the first element of `matrix` is updated to include the new `letter`, `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is updated to include the new `letter` and has a length of `len(letters) + 3`.
Output State: **`letters` is a non-empty string minus two characters, `i` is `len(letters) + 2`, the first element of `matrix` is updated to include the new `letter`, `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is updated to include the new `letter` and has a length of `len(letters) + 3**.
