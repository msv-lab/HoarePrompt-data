`selected_words` is updated by adding the character `matrix[i][j]` to it. According to the precondition, the condition `(not func_2(matrix, i, j))` is true, meaning `selected_words` is built up by collecting characters from the \((i+1)-th\) row of `matrix` where `func_2(matrix, i+1, j)` returns `False` for all \(0 \leq j < m\). The values of `j`, `m`, `n`, `matrix`, and `selected_words` (other than the added character) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` must be greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)-th\) row of `matrix` where `func_2(matrix, i+1, j)` returns `False` for all \(0 \leq j < m\), and the condition `(not func_2(matrix, i, j))` is true; `selected_words` is updated by adding the character `matrix[i][j]`**.
