Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial States:
- `j` is an integer less than `m` (i.e., `j + 1`).
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters.
- `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)\)-th row of `matrix` for all \(0 \leq j < m\) provided that `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` evaluates to `True` for each such \(j\).
- `selected_words` includes the character at `matrix[i][j]` added to its previous value if the condition `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` is met. Otherwise, `selected_words` remains unchanged.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is currently an integer less than `m` (i.e., `j + 1`).
   - `m` is still the same positive integer between 1 and 100.
   - `n` is still greater than 0.
   - `matrix` is still the same list of lists of characters.
   - `selected_words` is the current string derived based on the previous values of `j`.

2. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `m`.
   - After the previous iteration, `j` was less than `m`, so `j + 1` was valid.
   - In the next iteration, `j` will increase by 1, so the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `j` is currently less than `m`, in the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - Therefore, the new state will require `j` to be less than `m`, but now `j` will be `j + 1`.

### New States:
- `j` will be `j + 1`, which means `j` is now an integer less than `m` (i.e., `(j + 1) + 1`).

### Final Answer:
State: **`j` is an integer less than `m` (i.e., `(j + 1) + 1`), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` is greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, and `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)\)-th row of `matrix` for all \(0 \leq j < m\) provided that `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` evaluates to `True` for each such \(j\); `selected_words` includes the character at `matrix[i][j]` added to its previous value if the condition `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` is met. Otherwise, `selected_words` remains unchanged.**

This ensures that the loop can continue to the next iteration.
