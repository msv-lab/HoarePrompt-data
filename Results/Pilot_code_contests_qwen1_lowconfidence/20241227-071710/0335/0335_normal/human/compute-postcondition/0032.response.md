Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `letters` is a non-empty string minus one character.
   - `i` is `len(letters) + 2`.
   - The first element of `matrix` is updated to include the new `letter`.
   - `selected_words` is an empty string.
   - `row` is updated to include the new `letter` and has a length of `len(letters) + 1`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for letter in letters:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the `letters` string.
   - In each iteration, `letter` is set to the current character in the `letters` string.

4. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since we are starting a new iteration of the loop, `letter` will take the value of the next character in the `letters` string.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop and represents the position beyond the current length of `letters`.
   - The first element of `matrix` is already updated with the new `letter` from the previous iteration, so no further change is needed for this.
   - `selected_words` remains an empty string as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `row` is updated to include the new `letter` in the previous iteration, so its length is now `len(letters) + 1`. For the next iteration, `row` will be updated to include another character from `letters`.

Given these points, the states that need adjustment are:

- `letters` will lose one more character.
- `row` will be updated to include another character from `letters`, making its length `len(letters) + 2`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**`letters` is a non-empty string minus two characters, `i` is `len(letters) + 2`, the first element of `matrix` is updated to include the new `letter`, `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is updated to include the new `letter` and has a length of `len(letters) + 2`.**

State: **`letters` is a non-empty string minus two characters, `i` is `len(letters) + 2`, the first element of `matrix` is updated to include the new `letter`, `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is updated to include the new `letter` and has a length of `len(letters) + 2`**
