Output State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the rows of `matrix` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False` for all \(0 \leq j < m\) in every row `i` for which `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` evaluates to `True` for at least one \(j\), and `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration.**
