The code snippet `row.append(letter)` appends the value of `letter` to the list `row`. Since the initial state specifies that `letters` is a non-empty string, `letter` is one of its characters. However, the exact character value is not specified, so we will denote it as `letter`.

The initial state is:
- `letters` is a non-empty string
- `i` is 0
- `matrix` is an empty list
- `selected_words` is an empty string
- `row` is an empty list

After executing the line `row.append(letter)`, the list `row` will contain the character `letter` as its first (and only) element.

Output State: **`letters` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, `matrix` is an empty list, `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is a list containing the element `letter`**
