Output State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` is greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, and `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)\)-th row of `matrix` for all \(0 \leq j < m\) provided that `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` evaluates to `True` for each such \(j`**.

Explanation:
- After the loop executes, `j` will be equal to `m` because the loop continues as long as `j < m`. Once `j` reaches `m`, the loop terminates.
- The value of `m` remains unchanged throughout the loop, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The value of `n` also remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The `matrix` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The `selected_words` string accumulates characters from the \((i+1)\)-th row of `matrix` only when the condition `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` is `True` for each `j` from `0` to `m-1`.

Thus, `selected_words` will contain all characters from the \((i+1)\)-th row of `matrix` where the condition `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` is `True` for all `0 \leq j < m`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `m` is 0), then `selected_words` will remain an empty string.
