Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters read from `raw_input` calls, `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`:** These variables are initialized in the initial state and do not change within the loop. They represent the upper limits for the range function in the outer loop.
- **`matrix`:** This list accumulates rows of characters input from the user. Each iteration of the outer loop (`for i in range(n):`) appends a new row (`row`) to the `matrix`. After all iterations, `matrix` will contain exactly `n` rows, where each row is a list of characters read from the corresponding `raw_input` call.
- **`selected_words`:** This string remains unchanged throughout the loop and is always empty as per the initial state.
- **`row`:** This list contains the characters from the current line read from `raw_input` in each iteration. Its final value is not relevant to the overall output state since the loop completes and the final state is determined by the entire `matrix`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, `matrix` will contain `n` rows, each being a list of characters read from the corresponding `raw_input` calls.
