The code `row = []` initializes an empty list for the variable `row`. This affects the value of `row`, changing it from a list containing all the characters of `letters` to an empty list. The other variables (`letters`, `i`, `matrix`, `selected_words`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`letters` is a string provided by the user, `i` is the length of `letters` + 2, `matrix` is a list containing two elements which are both the list `row` (containing all the characters of `letters`), `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is an empty list.**
