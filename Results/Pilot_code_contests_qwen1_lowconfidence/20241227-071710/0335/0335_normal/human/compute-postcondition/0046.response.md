`selected_words` is updated by appending the character at position `j` (which is 2) in the `i-th` row of the `matrix` to the existing value of `selected_words`. The value of `j` remains 2, and the value of `m` and `n` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`j` is 2; `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\); `n` must be greater than 0; `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters; `selected_words` is the original string with the second character of the `i-th` row of `matrix` appended to it; `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration; the function `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False; `selected_words` is updated by appending `matrix[i][2]` to its current value.**
