According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `letters`. The loop will continue as long as there are more characters in the `letters` string.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `letters` is a non-empty string
- `i` is 0 (this is the index being iterated over)
- `matrix` is an empty list
- `selected_words` is an empty string
- `row` is a list containing the element `letter`

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must hold:
- There must still be characters left in the `letters` string.
- The index `i` will increment by 1, so it will be 1.
- The `matrix`, `selected_words`, and `row` will remain unchanged from the previous iteration since they are not modified within the loop body (assuming the loop body is omitted but does not modify these variables).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`letters` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, `matrix` is an empty list, `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is a list containing the element `letter`**
