`selected_words` is assigned the value of `selected_words + matrix[i][j]`. Given the initial state, `i` and `j` are indices that would point to a character in the `matrix` list. Since `j` is 0, this line of code appends the first character of the `i-th` row of the `matrix` to `selected_words`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100, `n` must be greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, `selected_words` is a string with the first character of the `i-th` row of `matrix` appended to it, `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration, and the function `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False.**
