The code `row.append(letter)` appends the value of `letter` to the list `row`. Since `letter` was part of the initial state as a non-empty string minus one character, appending this `letter` to `row` will update the value of `row`. The length of `row` will now be one more than its previous length. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`letters` is a non-empty string minus one character, `i` is `len(letters) + 2`, the first element of `matrix` is updated to include the new `letter`, `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is updated to include the new `letter` and has a length of `len(letters) + 1`.**
