According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\). The loop must continue as long as \(j < m\).

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2. Additionally, the condition \(1 \leq m \leq 100\) still holds true.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `j` becomes 2
- `m` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\)
- `n` must be greater than 0 (this does not change as it is not dependent on `j`)
- `matrix` remains the same list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters
- `selected_words` remains the original string with the second character of the `i-th` row of `matrix` appended to it
- `row` remains the list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration
- The function `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False (this does not change as it is not dependent on `j`)

State: **`j` is 2, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` must be greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, `selected_words` is the original string with the second character of the `i-th` row of `matrix` appended to it, `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration, and the function `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False.**
