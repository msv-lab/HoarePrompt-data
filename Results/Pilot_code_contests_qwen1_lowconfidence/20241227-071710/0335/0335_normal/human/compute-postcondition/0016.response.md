The code `row = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `row`. This action updates the value of `row` but does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `letters` is the string entered by the user, `i` is the length of the original `letters` + 1, `matrix` is a list containing one element which is the list `row` (containing all the characters in the new `letters`), `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is an empty list.
