Let's go through this step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `letters` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is `len(letters) + 1`.
   - `matrix` is a list containing the list `row` (which currently contains the next two characters of `letters`).
   - `selected_words` is an empty string.
   - `row` is a list containing two characters (the next two characters of `letters`).

2. Code Execution:
   - The line `row.append(letter)` appends the character `letter` to the list `row`.

3. Impact on Variables:
   - The list `row` now contains three characters because `letter` was appended to it.
   - The values of `letters`, `i`, `matrix`, and `selected_words` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`letters` is a non-empty string, `i` is `len(letters) + 1`, `matrix` is a list containing the list `row` (which now contains three characters), `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is a list containing three characters.**
