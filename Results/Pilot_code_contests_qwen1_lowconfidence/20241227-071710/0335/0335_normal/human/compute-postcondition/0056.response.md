Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` is greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, and `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)-th\) row of `matrix` for all \(0 \leq j < 1\) plus the character `matrix[i][1]`, provided that `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` evaluates to `True`. Otherwise, `selected_words` remains unchanged.***
