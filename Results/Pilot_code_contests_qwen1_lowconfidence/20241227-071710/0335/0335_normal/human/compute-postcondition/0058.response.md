Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's analyze the impact:

- `j` is 2.
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters.
- `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)-th\) row of `matrix` for all \(0 \leq j < 1\) plus the character `matrix[i][1]`, provided that `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` evaluates to `True`. Otherwise, `selected_words` remains unchanged.

The code snippet is:
```python
selected_words += matrix[i][j]
```

Since `j` is 2, the code becomes:
```python
selected_words += matrix[i][2]
```

This line adds the character at position `[i][2]` in the `matrix` to the `selected_words` string. Note that the condition `0 \leq j < 1` is never met because `j` is 2, so the condition does not affect the value of `selected_words`.

Thus, the only change is to the `selected_words` string by adding the character at position `[i][2]` in the `matrix`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `j` is 2 (unchanged).
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\) (unchanged).
- `n` is greater than 0 (unchanged).
- `matrix` is unchanged.
- `selected_words` is now `selected_words` plus the character at position `[i][2]` in the `matrix`.

Output State: **`j` is 2; `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\); `n` is greater than 0; `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters; `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)-th\) row of `matrix` for all \(0 \leq j < 1\) plus the character `matrix[i][1]`, provided that `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` evaluates to `True`, otherwise `selected_words` remains unchanged, and now `selected_words` includes the character `matrix[i][2]`.**
