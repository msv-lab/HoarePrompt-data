To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop iterates. The loop continues as long as \(j < m\). Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `j` is an integer less than `m`.
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\).
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters.
   - `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)\)-th row of `matrix` for all \(0 \leq j < m\) provided that `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` evaluates to `True` for each such \(j\).

2. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `j < m`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is an integer less than `m`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be equal to the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

Given these points, we can conclude:

- `j` will be incremented by 1.
- `m` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `matrix` remains the same.
- `selected_words` remains the same since the update condition involves `func_2`, which is not affected by the increment of `j`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`j` is an integer less than `m` (i.e., `j + 1`), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` is greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, and `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)\)-th row of `matrix` for all \(0 \leq j < m\) provided that `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` evaluates to `True` for each such \(j\)**.
