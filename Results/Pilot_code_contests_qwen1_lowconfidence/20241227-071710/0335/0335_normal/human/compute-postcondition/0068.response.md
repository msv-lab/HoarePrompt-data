Postcondition: ***`j` is an integer less than `m` (i.e., `j + 1`), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), `n` is greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, and `selected_words` is a string containing all characters from the \((i+1)\)-th row of `matrix` for all \(0 \leq j < m\) provided that `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` evaluates to `True` for each such \(j\); `selected_words` includes the character at `matrix[i][j]` added to its previous value if the condition `not func_2(matrix, i, j)` is met. Otherwise, `selected_words` remains unchanged.***
