The code snippet updates the string `selected_words` by appending the character `matrix[i][j]` to it. Given the initial state, `j` is 1, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `n` is greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements (each of which is a list of characters), `selected_words` is a string with the first character of the `i-th` row of `matrix` appended to it, `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration, and the function `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`.

After the code executes, `selected_words` will be updated by appending the character `matrix[i][j]`. Since `j` is initially 1, this means `selected_words` will have its current value plus the second character of the `i-th` row of `matrix`.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100, `n` must be greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, `selected_words` is the original string with the second character of the `i-th` row of `matrix` appended to it, `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration, and the function `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False.**
