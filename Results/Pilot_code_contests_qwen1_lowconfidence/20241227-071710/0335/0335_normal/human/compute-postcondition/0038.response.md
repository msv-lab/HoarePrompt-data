Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variable and Its Initial State:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop runs for `m` iterations because `j` ranges from `0` to `m-1`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `j`:**
   - Since the loop starts with `j = 0`, we need to ensure that `j` is initially set to `0`.

3. **Ensure the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop condition is `j < m`.
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `m`.

4. **Check the Constraints on `m`:**
   - `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100`.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters.
   - `selected_words` is an empty string.
   - `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `j` starts at `0` and is less than `m` for the loop to execute. Since `m` is already constrained to be between `1` and `100`, we don't need to adjust this constraint further.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:

- `j` should be `0` at the start of the loop.
- `j` must be less than `m`.

The final state after these adjustments is:

State: **`j` is 0, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100, `n` must be greater than 0, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of characters, `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is a list of characters read from the `raw_input` call in the corresponding iteration**
