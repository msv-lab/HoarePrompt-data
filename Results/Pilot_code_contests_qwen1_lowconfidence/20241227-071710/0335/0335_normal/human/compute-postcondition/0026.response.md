The code `letters = raw_input('')` reads a string from the user input and assigns it to the variable `letters`. This affects the value of `letters`, but does not affect the other variables.

- `i` is initially the length of the original `letters` plus 2.
- `matrix` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the list `row` (containing all the characters of `letters`).
- `selected_words` remains an empty string.
- `row` is a list containing all the characters of `letters`.

After executing the code, the value of `letters` changes to the input string provided by the user, while `i`, `matrix`, `selected_words`, and `row` retain their original properties and values relative to the new `letters`.

Output State: **`letters` is a string provided by the user, `i` is the length of `letters` + 2, `matrix` is a list containing two elements which are both the list `row` (containing all the characters of `letters`), `selected_words` is an empty string, `row` is a list containing all the characters of `letters`.**
