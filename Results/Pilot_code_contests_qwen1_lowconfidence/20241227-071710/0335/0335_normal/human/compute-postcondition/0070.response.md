`j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is no longer less than `m`. The `selected_words` variable is updated by adding the value of `matrix[i][j]` to it. The previous conditions about `j` being less than `m` are no longer applicable since `j` is now equal to `m` or greater. 

Output State: **`j` is equal to `m` or greater; `selected_words` is updated to include `matrix[i][j]`**
