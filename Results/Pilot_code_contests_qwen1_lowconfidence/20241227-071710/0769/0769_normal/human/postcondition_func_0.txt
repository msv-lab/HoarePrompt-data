The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `dice1` and `dice2`, both of which are lists of six integers representing the faces of two dice. The function attempts to determine if `dice1` can be made identical to `dice2` through a series of 24 roll operations, where each operation consists of rolling the die in the South-West-North direction four times, followed by a single roll to the South. After these operations, if `dice1` matches `dice2` at any point, the function sets `flag` to `True`; otherwise, `flag` remains `False`. The function returns `flag`.
