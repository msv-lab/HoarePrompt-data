`flag` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `j`, `dice1.numbers`, and `dice2.numbers` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 0, `dice1.numbers` and `dice2.numbers` are equal, `flag` is `True`.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `dice1.numbers` and `dice2.numbers` are equal, `flag` is `True`**
