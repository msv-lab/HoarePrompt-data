The code `dice1.roll_dice('SWN')` rolls the dice in the direction 'SWN' (South-West-North). This action typically changes the value of `dice1.numbers`, but does not affect `dice2.numbers`, `j`, or `flag`. Since the exact outcome of rolling the dice is not specified, we can only say that `dice1.numbers` will be updated to a new random value while `dice2.numbers` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `dice1.numbers` is a new random value, `dice2.numbers` is equal to `dice1.numbers` before the roll, `flag` is `True`**
