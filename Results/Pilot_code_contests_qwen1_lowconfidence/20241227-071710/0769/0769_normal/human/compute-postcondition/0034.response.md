The code `dice1.roll_dice('SWN')` is executed, which rolls the dice in the directions 'SWN'. However, since the specific implementation of `roll_dice` is not provided, we can assume that this method modifies the state of `dice1` in some way related to rolling dice in those directions. Given that no specific changes to variables are mentioned in the code, we can infer that the state of `dice1` is updated according to the roll.

Output State: **`dice1` is updated according to the roll in the directions 'SWN'**
