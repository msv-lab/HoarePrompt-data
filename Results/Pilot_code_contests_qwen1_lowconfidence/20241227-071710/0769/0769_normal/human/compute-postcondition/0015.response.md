Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `dice1.numbers` is a new random value, `dice2.numbers` is equal to `dice1.numbers` before the roll, and `flag` remains `True`. This holds true regardless of whether `dice1.numbers` equals `dice2.numbers` or not since there is no modification of `flag` in the else part.***
