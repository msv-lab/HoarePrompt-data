Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 1
   - `dice1.numbers` is a new random value
   - `dice2.numbers` is equal to `dice1.numbers` before the roll
   - `flag` remains `True`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in `range(4)`, which means `j` will take values from 0 to 3.

3. **Current Value of `j`:**
   - Since it is mentioned that this is the end of the previous iteration, `j` must have just completed its current value. Therefore, if `j` is currently 1, it means the loop has already executed once (for `j = 0`) and now we are at the start of the second iteration (for `j = 1`).

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must go from 1 to 2. Therefore, `j` will be set to 2 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - `dice1.numbers` will be updated to a new random value.
   - `dice2.numbers` will be set to the value of `dice1.numbers` before the roll (which means `dice2.numbers` will be equal to the new value of `dice1.numbers`).
   - `flag` will remain `True` as there is no modification of `flag` in the `else` part of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`j` is 2, `dice1.numbers` is a new random value, `dice2.numbers` is equal to `dice1.numbers` before the roll, and `flag` remains `True`**.
