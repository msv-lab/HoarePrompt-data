`dice1.roll_dice('SWN')` changes the top number of `dice1` based on the specified roll directions ('SWN'). However, the specific outcome of this roll is not provided in the code snippet, so we can only state that `dice1.numbers` will have a new top number after the roll. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 4, `dice1.numbers` has a new top number after rolling 'SWN', `dice2.numbers` is equal to the original value of `dice1.numbers` before any rolls, `flag` remains `True`, `i` is 4**
