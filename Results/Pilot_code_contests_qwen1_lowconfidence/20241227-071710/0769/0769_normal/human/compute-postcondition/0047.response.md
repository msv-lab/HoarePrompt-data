`dice1.roll_dice('SWN')` rolls the dice in the 'SWN' directions. This operation changes the value of `dice1.numbers` based on the specified roll directions. The values of `dice2.numbers`, `flag`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The top face of `dice1` becomes an unspecified value after the roll.

Output State: **`j` is 0; `dice1.numbers` is modified by rolling in 'SWN' directions; `dice2.numbers` is the original value before any rolls; `flag` is `True`; `i` is 5; the top face of `dice1` is now an unspecified value.**
