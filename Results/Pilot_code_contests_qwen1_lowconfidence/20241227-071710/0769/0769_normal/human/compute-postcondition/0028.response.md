Postcondition: ***`j` is 4, `dice1.numbers` is a new value (top number possibly different from 5), `dice2.numbers` is equal to the original value of `dice1.numbers` before any rolls, `flag` remains `True`, `i` is 4. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as the same as the if part's postcondition.***
