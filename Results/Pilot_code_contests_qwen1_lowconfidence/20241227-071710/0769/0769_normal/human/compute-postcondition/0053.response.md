Postcondition: ***`j` is 1; the top face of `dice1` is a specific face (unknown); `dice2.numbers` is the original value before any rolls; `flag` is `True`; `i` is 5. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition if the condition `dice1.numbers == dice2.numbers` evaluates to true.***
