The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `dice1` and `dice2`. Both `dice1` and `dice2` are lists of six integers, each representing the faces of a die, where the integers assigned to the faces are in the range from 0 to 100. The function returns a boolean value `flag`, which is `False` since the faces of `dice1` do not equal the faces of `dice2` at any point during the 24 rolls.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `dice1` and `dice2`, both are lists of six integers representing the faces of two dice. It returns `False` if the faces of `dice1` do not equal the faces of `dice2` at any point during the 24 rolls.**
