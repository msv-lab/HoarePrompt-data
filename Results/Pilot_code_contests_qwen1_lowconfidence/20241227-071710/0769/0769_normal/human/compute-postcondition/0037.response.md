Output State: **`j` is 4, `dice1.numbers` is the result of rolling the dice 4 times in the direction 'SWN', `dice2.numbers` is the original value of `dice1.numbers` before any rolls, `flag` is True if `dice1.numbers` equals `dice2.numbers` after the loop, otherwise `flag` is False, `i` is 4.**

### Explanation:
- **`j`**: The loop runs exactly 4 times, so `j` remains 4 after the loop.
- **`dice1.numbers`**: After each iteration of the loop, `dice1.numbers` is updated according to the roll in the direction 'SWN'. Since the loop runs 4 times, `dice1.numbers` will be the result of these 4 rolls.
- **`dice2.numbers`**: This variable remains unchanged and retains its original value before any rolls were made.
- **`flag`**: The flag is set to `True` only if `dice1.numbers` equals `dice2.numbers` at the end of the loop. If they do not match, `flag` remains `False`.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` is not involved in the loop and remains unchanged at 4.

Since the loop runs exactly 4 times, the conditions for the output state are fully determined by the loop's execution.
