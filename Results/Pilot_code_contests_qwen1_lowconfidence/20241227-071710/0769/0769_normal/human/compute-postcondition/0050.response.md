According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates from `0` to `3` inclusive because `xrange(4)` generates numbers from `0` to `3`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `j` is 0
- `dice1.numbers` is modified by rolling in 'SWN' directions
- `dice2.numbers` is the original value before any rolls
- `flag` is `True`
- `i` is 5
- The top face of `dice1` is now an unspecified value

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be within the range of `0` to `3`. Since `j` is currently `0`, it needs to be incremented to `1` to enter the next iteration.

The other states (`dice1.numbers`, `dice2.numbers`, `flag`, `i`, and the top face of `dice1`) remain unchanged as there is no indication that they are affected by the loop itself.

State: **`j` is 1; `dice1.numbers` is modified by rolling in 'SWN' directions; `dice2.numbers` is the original value before any rolls; `flag` is `True`; `i` is 5; the top face of `dice1` is now an unspecified value**
