The variable `flag` is set to `True`. The lists `dice1` and `dice2` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the condition that the numbers in `dice1` are equal to the numbers in `dice2` still holds.

Output State: **`dice1` is a list of six integers, `dice2` is a list of six integers, `flag` is True.**
