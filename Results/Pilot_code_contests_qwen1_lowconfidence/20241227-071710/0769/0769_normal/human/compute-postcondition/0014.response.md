The code `flag = True` does not change the value of `flag` since it is already set to `True`. The values of `j`, `dice1.numbers`, `dice2.numbers`, and `flag` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `dice1.numbers` is a new random value, `dice2.numbers` is equal to `dice1.numbers` before the roll, `flag` is `True`**
