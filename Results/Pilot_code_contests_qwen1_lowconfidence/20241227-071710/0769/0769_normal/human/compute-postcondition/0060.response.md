Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `dice1` and `dice2`, both of which are lists of six integers representing the faces of two dice. The function attempts to determine if `dice1` can be made identical to `dice2` through a series of 24 roll operations, where each operation consists of rolling the die in the South-West-North direction four times, followed by a single roll to the South. After these operations, if `dice1` matches `dice2` at any point, the function sets `flag` to `True`; otherwise, `flag` remains `False`. The function returns `flag`.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function assumes that the initial orientation of `dice1` does not matter, and it tries to align `dice1` with `dice2` through the specified sequence of rolls. However, the function does not account for the initial orientation of `dice1`, which could affect the outcome.
- The function does not handle the case where `dice1` and `dice2` start with different top faces; it only checks if they can match after the specified number of rolls.
- The function does not validate if the numbers on `dice1` and `dice2` can be matched through the allowed sequence of rolls. For instance, if the numbers on the faces of `dice1` and `dice2` are such that no sequence of rolls can make them identical, the function will incorrectly return `False`.
- The function does not ensure that the numbers on `dice1` and `dice2` are valid (i.e., between 0 and 100 inclusive). This could lead to incorrect behavior if invalid numbers are passed as input.
