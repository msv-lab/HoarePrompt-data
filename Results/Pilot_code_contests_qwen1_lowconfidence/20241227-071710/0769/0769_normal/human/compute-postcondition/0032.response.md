Postcondition: ***`j` is 4, `dice1.numbers` has a new top number after rolling 'SWN', `dice2.numbers` is equal to the original value of `dice1.numbers` before any rolls, `flag` is True, `i` is 4. Since the if condition `dice1.numbers == dice2.numbers` does not change the values of the variables when evaluated as true, these values remain unchanged in both cases (if and no else).***
