Postcondition: **`dice1` and `dice2` are lists of six integers. If `dice1.numbers` equals `dice2.numbers` at any point during the comparison, `flag` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `flag` remains `False` after all 24 rolls (4 rolls per iteration for 6 iterations), `i` is 5, and `dice1`'s top face is an unspecified value while `dice2.numbers` retains its original value before any rolls.**
