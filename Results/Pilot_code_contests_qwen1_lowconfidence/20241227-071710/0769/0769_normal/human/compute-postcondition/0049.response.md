Postcondition: ***`j` is 0; `dice1.numbers` is modified by rolling in 'SWN' directions; `dice2.numbers` is the original value before any rolls; `flag` is `True`; `i` is 5; the top face of `dice1` is now an unspecified value. This is true regardless of whether `dice1.numbers` equals `dice2.numbers` or not since there is no else part provided that would change these conditions when the if condition is false.***
