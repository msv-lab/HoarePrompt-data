Postcondition: ***`j` must be in the range [0, 3], `dice1.numbers` is modified by additional rolls in the 'S', 'W', and 'N' directions, `dice2.numbers` is the original value before any rolls, `flag` is `True`, `i` is 5, and `dice1`'s top face is now an unspecified value (initially 6). This is because the condition `dice1.numbers == dice2.numbers` is true within the if block, setting `flag` to `True`. There is no alternative case since the else part is not provided.***
