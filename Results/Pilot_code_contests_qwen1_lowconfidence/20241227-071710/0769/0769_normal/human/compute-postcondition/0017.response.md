`dice1.numbers` is updated to a new random value after rolling the dice, and `dice2.numbers` remains equal to the original value of `dice1.numbers` before the roll. The `roll_dice` method does not affect `j` or `flag`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`j` is 2, `dice1.numbers` is a new random value, `dice2.numbers` is equal to the original value of `dice1.numbers` before the roll, and `flag` remains `True`.**
