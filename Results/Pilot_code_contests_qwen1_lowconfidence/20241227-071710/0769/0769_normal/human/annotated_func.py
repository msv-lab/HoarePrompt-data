#State of the program right berfore the function call: dice1 and dice2 are lists of six integers each, representing the faces of two dice. The integers assigned to the faces are in the same format as described in Dice III, and it is guaranteed that 0 ≤ the integer assigned to a face ≤ 100.

    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `dice1` and `dice2` are lists of six integers. If `dice1.numbers` equals `dice2.numbers` at any point during the comparison, `flag` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `flag` remains `False` after all 24 rolls (4 rolls per iteration for 6 iterations), `i` is 5, and `dice1`'s top face is an unspecified value while `dice2.numbers` retains its original value before any rolls.

    #The program returns flag which is False since dice1.numbers does not equal dice2.numbers at any point during the 24 rolls
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `dice1` and `dice2`, both of which are lists of six integers representing the faces of two dice. The function attempts to determine if `dice1` can be made identical to `dice2` through a series of 24 roll operations, where each operation consists of rolling the die in the South-West-North direction four times, followed by a single roll to the South. After these operations, if `dice1` matches `dice2` at any point, the function sets `flag` to `True`; otherwise, `flag` remains `False`. The function returns `flag`.
