Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine if the dices are all different according to the rules defined in Dice III. Specifically, the `func_1` function checks if two dices are the same by rotating one of the dices and comparing the faces. However, the logic in the `func_1` function has a flaw: it only checks one initial orientation for each dice and does not fully explore all possible orientations.

To illustrate the issue, consider two dices with the following faces:
- Dice 1: \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\)
- Dice 2: \(2, 1, 6, 4, 5, 3\)

These two dices should be considered different because they do not match after any rotation. However, the current implementation might incorrectly identify them as the same if it happens to check their faces in an orientation where they appear identical.

A correct approach would involve checking all possible rotations of both dices to ensure they are not identical. Hereâ€™s a simplified version of how this could be implemented:

```python
def compare_dice(dice1, dice2):
    for _ in range(6):  # Check all 6 faces of the first dice
        for _ in range(4):  # Rotate the first dice 4 times
            if dice1.get_top() != dice2.get_top():
                return False
            dice1.roll_dice('S')
        dice1.roll_dice('W')
    return True

dice_number = int(input())
dices = []
for _ in range(dice_number):
    dices.append(Dice([int(x) for x in input().split()]))

all_different = True
for i in range(dice_number - 1):
    for j in range(i + 1, dice_number):
        if compare_dice(dices[i], dices[j]):
            all_different = False
            break
    if not all_different:
        break

print('Yes' if all_different else 'No')
```

This version ensures that all possible orientations of the dices are checked before concluding they are the same. If any orientation does not match, the dices are considered different.
