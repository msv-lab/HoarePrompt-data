Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining if all given dices are different according to the rules defined in Dice III. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Roll Operations**: The roll operations (`move_south`, `move_north`, `move_east`, `move_west`) are not implemented correctly. They should change the orientation of the dice faces to simulate the specified movements, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

2. **Comparison Logic**: The comparison logic in `func_1` is flawed. It attempts to rotate the dice and check if the faces match, but the current implementation does not correctly handle all possible rotations and configurations of the dice.

3. **Functionality Mismatch**: The function `func_1` is designed to check if two dices are the same by simulating 24 possible orientations, but the problem requires checking if all dices are different. The current implementation does not cover all necessary cases to ensure the dices are distinct.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

- Input:
  ```
  3
  1 2 3 4 5 6
  6 2 4 3 5 1
  6 5 4 3 2 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  No
  ```

However, due to the flawed implementation of the roll operations and comparison logic, the program may incorrectly determine that the dices are different.

Since the program does not correctly implement the required logic and fails to handle all possible configurations of the dices, the correctness is **False**.
