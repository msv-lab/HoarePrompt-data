Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the dices are all different according to the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Uniqueness:**
   - The program uses the `func_1` function to compare two dices. This function checks if one dice can be rotated to match the other dice. However, it does not ensure that all dices are unique; it only checks pairs of dices.
   - The main logic in the program iterates through pairs of dices and uses `func_1` to check if they are the same. If any pair is found to be the same, it prints "No" and exits. If no such pair is found, it prints "Yes".
   - This approach only checks pairs, but the problem requires checking if all dices are different. The current implementation does not check every possible permutation of the dices to ensure uniqueness.

2. **Missing Full Uniqueness Check:**
   - The program should iterate through all dices and ensure that no two dices are identical. It should not stop after finding just one pair of identical dices.
   - The `func_1` function checks if one dice can be rotated to match another. If this is true, the dices are considered the same. However, it does not account for the possibility that a third dice might also match one of them, making all three the same.

3. **Output Format Mismatch:**
   - The problem description specifies that the output should be "Yes" if all dices are different and "No" if any two dices are the same. However, the program outputs "No" as soon as it finds any two identical dices. This is inconsistent with the requirement to output "No" only if any two dices are the same, not just the first pair it encounters.

To fix these issues, the program needs to:
- Ensure that all dices are checked against each other.
- Use a more comprehensive approach to verify the uniqueness of each dice compared to all others.
- Change the output logic to correctly reflect the requirement.

Here is a modified version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python

This modified version ensures that all dices are checked against each other to ensure they are unique, thus meeting the problem description.
