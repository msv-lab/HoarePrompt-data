Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program seems to attempt to verify if the given dices are all different by comparing their configurations after rotating them. However, there are several issues that make the program incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is supposed to check if two dices are identical. It attempts to set the top face of `dice1` to each possible value (1 through 6) and then rotate it accordingly to check if it matches `dice2`. However, the function `func_1` does not handle all possible rotations correctly. Specifically, the sequence of rotations (`'SWN'`) used in the loop might not cover all possible orientations of the dice. 

2. **Rotation Logic**: The function `roll_dice` and the specific rotation sequences used in `func_1` do not ensure that all possible orientations of the dice are checked. For example, rotating only using `'SWN'` and `'S'` might miss some orientations.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:
- Let's assume we have two dices with the following configurations:
  - Dice 1: Top=1, Front=2, Left=3, Right=4, Back=5, Bottom=6
  - Dice 2: Top=1, Front=2, Left=4, Right=3, Back=5, Bottom=6

The program might incorrectly determine these dices to be the same because the specific sequence of rotations used does not account for all possible orientations.

Since the program does not guarantee that all possible orientations are checked, it is not guaranteed to work correctly for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
