Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly determine if the dices are all different according to the rules defined in Dice III. Specifically, the `func_1` function, as implemented, only checks one initial orientation for each dice and does not fully explore all possible orientations. This means it might incorrectly identify different dices as the same. 

For example, the provided dices with faces \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\) and \(2, 1, 6, 4, 5, 3\) should be considered different, but the current implementation might incorrectly identify them as the same. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and the output hints support the correctness of the original assessment.
