Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. The function `func_1` attempts to check if two dice can be made identical through a series of rolls, but it does not handle all possible orientations and positions of the dice faces. Specifically, the program only checks a limited set of rotations (South-West-North four times followed by a South roll), which is insufficient to cover all possible configurations of the dice.

For example, consider the following two dice configurations:
- Dice 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
- Dice 2: [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6]

The provided code would incorrectly determine that these dice are the same because it does not account for all possible rotations and positions of the dice faces. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
