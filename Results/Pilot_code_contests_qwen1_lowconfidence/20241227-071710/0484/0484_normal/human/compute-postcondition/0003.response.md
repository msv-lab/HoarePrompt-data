The code prints the length of the list `ans` followed by the elements of `ans` joined into a single string separated by spaces. Let's analyze the impact:

1. The length of `ans` is calculated, which is `k // 2 + 1 + (n + 1 - (k + 1)) = k // 2 + n - k`.
2. The elements of `ans` are printed in a single line.

After the print statement, the variables `T`, `n`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged except for the fact that `ans` has been printed. However, since the problem asks for the state of the variables after the code execution and does not ask for the printed output itself, we focus on the variables that are updated or remain the same.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\); `n` is the first integer input; `k` is the second integer input; `ans` is a list containing integers from `1` to `k // 2 + 1` followed by integers from `k + 1` to `n + 1`.**
