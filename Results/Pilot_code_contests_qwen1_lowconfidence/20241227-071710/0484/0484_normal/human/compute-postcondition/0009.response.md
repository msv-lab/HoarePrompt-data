The code `n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())` reads two integers from the standard input, splits them by whitespace, and converts them to integers. These values are then assigned to `n` and `k`.

- `n` and `k` are assigned the integer values read from the input.
- `T` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\).
- `ans` remains a list containing integers from `1` to `k // 2 + 1` followed by integers from `k + 1` to `n + 1`.
- `new_input` is not defined yet.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\); `n` is an integer read from the input; `k` is an integer read from the input; `ans` is a list containing integers from `1` to `k // 2 + 1` followed by integers from `k + 1` to `n + 1`; `new_input` is not defined yet.**
