The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the standard input using `map(int, stdin.readline().split())`. This means `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the first and second integers read from the input, respectively. The variables `T`, `ans`, and `new_input` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\); `n` is the first integer input; `k` is the second integer input; `ans` is a list containing integers from `1` to `k // 2 + 1` followed by integers from `k + 1` to `n + 1`; `new_input` is not defined yet**
