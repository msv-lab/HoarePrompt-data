The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it implies that the parameters `T`, `n`, and `k` are provided through some external means (such as a loop or list of inputs). The function processes these values based on the given constraints: `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1000. 

For each test case, the function does not specify a direct return but processes the values of `n` and `k` according to their constraints. Given the output cases are not specified directly, we can infer the function might return results based on specific conditions within the loop or processing of these test cases.

However, adhering strictly to the format requested:

The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. It processes a series of test cases where `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1000. The functionality of the function `func` is to process these test cases based on the provided constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases where `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1000.**
