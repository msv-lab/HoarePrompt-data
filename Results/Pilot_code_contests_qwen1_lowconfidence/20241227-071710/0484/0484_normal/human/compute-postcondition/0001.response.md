The code `n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())` reads two integers from standard input, splits them, and converts them into integers, assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state of `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\), which remains unchanged. Therefore, `T` retains its original value.

After the code is executed, the following variables are updated:
- `n` is assigned the first integer input from the standard input.
- `k` is assigned the second integer input from the standard input.

The output state is: `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\); `n` is the first integer input; `k` is the second integer input.
Output State: **`T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\); `n` is the first integer input; `k` is the second integer input.**
