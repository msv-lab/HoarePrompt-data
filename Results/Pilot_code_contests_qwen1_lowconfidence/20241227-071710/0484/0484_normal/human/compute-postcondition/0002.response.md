Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The code creates a list `ans` using list comprehension. It combines two ranges:
   - The first range is from `1` to `k // 2 + 1`.
   - The second range is from `k + 1` to `n + 1`.

2. The values of `T`, `n`, and `k` are unchanged by this operation.

3. The resulting list `ans` contains all integers from `1` to `k // 2 + 1` followed by all integers from `k + 1` to `n + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\); `n` is the first integer input; `k` is the second integer input; `ans` is a list containing integers from `1` to `k // 2 + 1` followed by integers from `k + 1` to `n + 1`.**
