Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases where `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 100. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1000. It then constructs a list `ans` containing integers from `1` to `k // 2 + 1` followed by integers from `k + 1` to `n + 1`. Finally, it prints the length of `ans` followed by the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. After processing all test cases, the program stops reading further inputs. Potential edge cases include when `k` is even or odd, and when `T` is at its minimum or maximum value. The function handles these cases by correctly constructing the list `ans` based on the given values of `n` and `k`.**
