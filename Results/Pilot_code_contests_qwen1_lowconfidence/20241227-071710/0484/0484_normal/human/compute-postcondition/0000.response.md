Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop is controlled by `input()` inside `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop will run as many times as the integer input provided by the user.

2. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the user must provide an integer input. Let's denote this input by `T`.
   - We know from the problem statement that `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\).

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop depends on the input value `T`, we need to ensure that the user inputs a valid value within the specified range.
   - Before the loop starts, we need to set `T` to a value that satisfies the condition \(1 \leq T \leq 100\).

Given these points, the required states to adjust for the loop to execute are:

**State: **`T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\)**.
