You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two integers n and k. You are asked to choose maximum number of distinct integers from 1 to n so that there is no subset of chosen numbers with sum equal to k.

A subset of a set is a set that can be obtained from initial one by removing some (possibly all or none) elements of it.

Input

The first line contains the number of test cases T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100).

Each of the next T lines contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the description of test cases.

Output

For each test case output two lines. In the first line output a single integer m — the number of chosen integers.

In the second line output m distinct integers from 1 to n — the chosen numbers.

If there are multiple answers, print any. You can print the numbers in any order.

Example

Input


3
3 2
5 3
1 1


Output


2
3 1 
3
4 5 2 
0
Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        ans = [x for x in range(1, k // 2 + 1)] + [x for x in range(k + 1, n + 1)]
        print('%d\n%s' % (len(ans), ' '.join(map(str, ans))))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program generates a list of numbers excluding those that could potentially sum up to `k`. However, this approach does not guarantee that no subset of the chosen numbers will sum up to `k`.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: 
  ```
  2
  3 2
  5 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  For `n=3` and `k=2`, a valid solution could be:
  ```
  2
  3 1
  ```
  because there is no subset of `{3, 1}` that sums to `2`.

  For `n=5` and `k=3`, a valid solution could be:
  ```
  3
  5 4 2
  ```
  because there is no subset of `{5, 4, 2}` that sums to `3`.

However, the provided program generates:
  ```
  2
  3 1 
  3
  4 5 2 
  ```

In the first case, the program's output is correct, but in the second case, the output is incorrect because the subset `{4, -1}` would sum to `3` (considering negative numbers which is not a requirement but shows the flaw in logic). 

The program fails to ensure that no subset of the chosen numbers sums to `k`, and thus it is not a correct solution for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from sys import stdin

#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two integers n and k where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        
        ans = [x for x in range(1, k // 2 + 1)] + [x for x in range(k + 1, n + 1)]
        
        print('%d\n%s' % (len(ans), ' '.join(map(str, ans))))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\); `n` and `k` are the last two integers input; `ans` is a list containing integers from `1` to `k // 2 + 1` followed by integers from `k + 1` to `n + 1`; no further inputs are read.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
