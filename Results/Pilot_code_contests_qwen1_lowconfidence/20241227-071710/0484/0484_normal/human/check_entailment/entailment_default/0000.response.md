Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code constructs a list `ans` containing integers from `1` to `k // 2 + 1` followed by integers from `k + 1` to `n + 1`. This approach does not guarantee that no subset of the chosen numbers will sum to `k`. 

For example, consider the test case `n = 5` and `k = 3`. According to the problem description, the output should be a set of numbers from which no subset sums to `k`. The code constructs the list `[1, 2, 4, 5]`, which includes the numbers `1` and `2`, whose sum is `3`. Therefore, this output violates the requirement that no subset of the chosen numbers should sum to `k`.

To correctly solve the problem, the chosen numbers need to be carefully selected to ensure that no subset sums to `k`. The current implementation does not meet this requirement. Hence, the program is incorrect.
