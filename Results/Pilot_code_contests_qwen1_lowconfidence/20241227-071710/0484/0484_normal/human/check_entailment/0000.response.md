Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not guarantee that there will be no subset of chosen numbers with a sum equal to k. For example, consider the input `n = 5` and `k = 3`. The program generates the list `[1, 2, 4, 5]`, which does not contain any subset summing to 3. However, this solution is not optimal because it does not maximize the number of chosen integers. A better solution would be `[1, 2, 4]`, which also avoids any subset summing to 3 but includes more numbers. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirement of maximizing the number of chosen integers under the given constraint.
