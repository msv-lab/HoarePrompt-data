Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` (where \(1 \leq T \leq 100\)).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (where \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 1000\)).

2. **Constructing the Answer**:
   - The program constructs a list `ans` that includes:
     - Integers from `1` to `k // 2 + 1`.
     - Integers from `k + 1` to `n + 1`.
   - This construction ensures that no subset of the chosen numbers can sum up to `k` because:
     - Numbers in the range `[1, k // 2 + 1]` are smaller than `k` and hence cannot form a subset that sums to `k`.
     - Numbers in the range `[k + 1, n + 1]` are larger than `k` and hence cannot form a subset that sums to `k`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of `ans` and the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.
   - This output format matches the required format specified in the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles various edge cases:
     - When `k` is even or odd.
     - When `T` is at its minimum or maximum value.
   - The construction of `ans` ensures that the constraints are met for all possible values of `n` and `k`.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement and meets all the specifications. Therefore, the program is correct.
