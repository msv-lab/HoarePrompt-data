Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_6(a, b)` does not correctly determine to which girlfriend Vasya will go more often. The logic in `func_6` does not accurately reflect the problem description. Specifically, the function uses `func_2(a, b)` to calculate a value `L` and then incorrectly assumes that the difference between `L` and multiples of `a` or `b` can determine the frequency of visits to either girlfriend. This approach does not correctly model the scenario where Vasya chooses the direction of the first arriving train in case of simultaneous arrivals.

To illustrate, let's consider the input `a = 3` and `b = 7`:

1. `func_1(a, b)` computes the GCD of `a` and `b`, which is `1`.
2. `func_2(a, b)` calculates `a / GCD(a, b) * b = 3 * 7 = 21`.
3. The function then checks if `a < b` and proceeds to compute `M` and `D` based on `L = 21`.

However, the actual solution involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, which is the smallest interval after which the pattern repeats. The LCM can be computed as `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)`, and the frequency of visits can be determined by dividing the LCM by `a` and `b`.

For `a = 3` and `b = 7`, the LCM is `21`, and Vasya will visit Dasha and Masha equally often because the intervals for each are 7 and 3 respectively, and `21/3 = 7` and `21/7 = 3`. Thus, Vasya will visit each girlfriend 7 times for every 3 times he visits the other.

The function `func_6` does not perform this calculation, leading to an incorrect determination of visit frequencies. Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description.
