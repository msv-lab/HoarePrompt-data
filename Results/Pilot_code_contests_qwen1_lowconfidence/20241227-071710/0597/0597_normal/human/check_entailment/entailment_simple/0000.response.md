Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine to which girlfriend Vasya will go more often based on the given problem description. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, and `func_6` do not align with the requirements described in the problem statement.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **GCD Calculation and Frequency Analysis**:
   - The problem requires comparing the frequencies `a` and `b` to determine how often Vasya will go to each girlfriend.
   - The function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, which is not directly useful for determining the frequency-based decision-making process described in the problem.

2. **Frequency-Based Logic**:
   - The function `func_6` is intended to determine which girlfriend Vasya will visit more often. However, it uses a flawed approach based on GCD and LCM calculations rather than the actual frequencies.
   - Specifically, the logic in `func_6` uses `L = func_2(a, b)` and then attempts to compare `a` and `b` with the calculated `M` and `D`. This does not correctly reflect the logic required by the problem.

3. **Incorrect Frequency Comparison**:
   - The problem states that if two trains arrive simultaneously, Vasya chooses the direction with the lower frequency. The current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario.
   - The function `func_6` should compare the frequencies `a` and `b` directly and decide based on which frequency is lower, not through complex GCD and LCM calculations.

### Correct Implementation:

A correct implementation would directly compare the frequencies `a` and `b` and decide based on which one is lower. Here is a simplified version of the solution:

```python
def func_6(a, b):
    if a < b:
        return 'Masha'
    elif b < a:
        return 'Dasha'
    else:
        return 'Equal'
```

This function directly compares `a` and `b` and returns the appropriate result based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description due to its use of unnecessary and incorrect calculations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
