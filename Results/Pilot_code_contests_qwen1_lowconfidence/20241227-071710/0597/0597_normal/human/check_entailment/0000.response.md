Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining to which girlfriend Vasya will go more often. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are not relevant to solving this problem. The function `func_5` is a helper function for calculating the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is also not needed for this problem.

The core logic required to solve this problem involves calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of the simultaneous arrivals of trains going to both directions. The function `func_6` attempts to do this but contains several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Simultaneous Arrival Time**: The calculation inside `func_6` is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that the simultaneous arrival time can be derived directly from the LCM and the individual intervals without properly considering the periodic nature of the schedules.

2. **Incorrect Comparison Logic**: The comparison logic inside `func_6` does not correctly handle the frequency comparison and the determination of which direction Vasya will choose.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the periodicity of the simultaneous arrivals and then determine how often Vasya will choose each direction based on these periods. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
import math

def more_frequent_girlfriend(a, b):
    # Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b
    lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
    
    # Calculate the time periods for each girl
    period_dasha = a
    period_masha = b
    
    # Determine how often Vasya chooses each direction
    if period_dasha < period_masha:
        return "Dasha"
    elif period_masha < period_dasha:
        return "Masha"
    else:
        return "Equal"

# Read input
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Determine the result
result = more_frequent_girlfriend(a, b)
print(result)
```

This corrected program accurately implements the logic required to determine which girlfriend Vasya will visit more often based on the given input.
