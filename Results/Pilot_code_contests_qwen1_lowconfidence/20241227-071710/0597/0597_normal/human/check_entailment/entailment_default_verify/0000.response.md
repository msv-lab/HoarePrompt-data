Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine to which girlfriend Vasya will go more often. The function `func_6` contains several issues that prevent it from functioning correctly:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Simultaneous Arrival Time**: The function attempts to calculate the periodicity of simultaneous arrivals but does so in a manner that is not aligned with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the logic inside `func_6` is flawed and does not correctly determine the periodicity of the simultaneous arrivals of trains going to both directions.

2. **Incorrect Comparison Logic**: The comparison logic inside `func_6` does not correctly handle the frequency comparison and the determination of which direction Vasya will choose. The function does not properly account for the periodic nature of the schedules and the decision-making process based on the frequency of trains.

Given these issues, the function `func_6` does not correctly determine the girlfriend to whom Vasya will go more often, as per the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is accurate.
