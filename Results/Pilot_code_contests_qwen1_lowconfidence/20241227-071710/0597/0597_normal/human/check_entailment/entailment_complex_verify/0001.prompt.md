You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya the programmer lives in the middle of the Programming subway branch. He has two girlfriends: Dasha and Masha, who live at the different ends of the branch, each one is unaware of the other one's existence.

When Vasya has some free time, he goes to one of his girlfriends. He descends into the subway at some time, waits the first train to come and rides on it to the end of the branch to the corresponding girl. However, the trains run with different frequencies: a train goes to Dasha's direction every a minutes, but a train goes to Masha's direction every b minutes. If two trains approach at the same time, Vasya goes toward the direction with the lower frequency of going trains, that is, to the girl, to whose directions the trains go less frequently (see the note to the third sample).

We know that the trains begin to go simultaneously before Vasya appears. That is the train schedule is such that there exists a moment of time when the two trains arrive simultaneously.

Help Vasya count to which girlfriend he will go more often.

Input

The first line contains two integers a and b (a ≠ b, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 106).

Output

Print "Dasha" if Vasya will go to Dasha more frequently, "Masha" if he will go to Masha more frequently, or "Equal" if he will go to both girlfriends with the same frequency.

Examples

Input

3 7


Output

Dasha


Input

5 3


Output

Masha


Input

2 3


Output

Equal

Note

Let's take a look at the third sample. Let the trains start to go at the zero moment of time. It is clear that the moments of the trains' arrival will be periodic with period 6. That's why it is enough to show that if Vasya descends to the subway at a moment of time inside the interval (0, 6], he will go to both girls equally often. 

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 0 to 2, he leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the second minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 2 to 3, he leaves for Masha on the train that arrives by the third minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 3 to 4, he leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the fourth minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 4 to 6, he waits for both trains to arrive by the sixth minute and goes to Masha as trains go less often in Masha's direction.

In sum Masha and Dasha get equal time — three minutes for each one, thus, Vasya will go to both girlfriends equally often.

            return Da


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_6` is supposed to determine to which girlfriend Vasya will go more often based on the given intervals. However, the implementation does not correctly handle the logic of choosing between Dasha and Masha when two trains arrive at the same time. Additionally, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` do not seem to be used in the context of solving the problem, and their presence is unclear.

For instance, consider the case where `a = 3` and `b = 4`. According to the problem description, if two trains arrive at the same time, Vasya should choose the direction with the lower frequency of trains. In this case, since 3 < 4, Vasya should always go to Dasha when a train from both directions arrives simultaneously. However, the provided code does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to an incorrect output.

To properly solve the problem, the code needs to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then calculate how often Vasya would go to each girlfriend based on the intervals. The current implementation does not achieve this.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin
output = sys.stdout
MAX = 10 ** 6
Da = 'Dasha'
Ma = 'Masha'
S = input.readline().split(' ')
a = int(S[0])
b = int(S[1])
assert 1 <= a and a <= MAX
assert 1 <= b and b <= MAX
assert a != b
answer = func_6(a, b)
output.write('%s\n' % answer)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers where a ≠ b and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns a which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of a and b
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are within the range of 1 to \(10^6\) and `a` is not equal to `b`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function returns the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. 

After the function concludes, the state of the program is such that `a` contains the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is guaranteed to be 0. This is because the while loop continues to update `a` and `b` until `b` becomes 0, at which point `a` holds the GCD. 

Edge cases to consider:
- If `a` or `b` is 1, the GCD will also be 1.
- If `a` and `b` are already equal, the function will still execute the loop but `b` will become 0 after one iteration, and `a` will hold the value of `a` (which is also the GCD).
- If `a` or `b` is 0, the GCD will be the non-zero number. However, since both `a` and `b` are specified to be positive integers, this case does not need to be explicitly handled.

The function does not have any missing functionality based on the provided code.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers where a ≠ b, and the function func_1(a, b) returns a positive integer such that a * b / func_1(a, b) is an integer.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a / func_1(a, b) * b
    #a / func_1(a, b) * b
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2(a, b)` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` where `a ≠ b`. It calculates the value of `a / func_1(a, b) * b`, where `func_1(a, b)` returns a positive integer such that `a * b / func_1(a, b)` is an integer. The function then returns this calculated value. Potential edge cases include when `func_1(a, b)` returns 1 (the simplest case), or when `a` and `b` have no common factors other than 1, meaning `func_1(a, b)` would need to return their least common multiple. If `func_1(a, b)` does not exist or is not properly defined, the function will raise an error.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: 
def func_3(numbers):
    return reduce(lambda a, b: func_1(a, b), numbers)
    #The program returns the result of applying the function `func_1` cumulatively to the items of `numbers` using the function `reduce`, starting with the first item as the initial accumulator value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list `numbers` as input and returns the result of applying the `func_1` function cumulatively to the items of `numbers` using the `reduce` function, starting with the first item as the initial accumulator value. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, but it is assumed that `func_1` is defined and works correctly. If `numbers` is an empty list, the function will return `None` because `reduce` cannot operate on an empty sequence.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers, and the function `func_2` is assumed to be defined elsewhere and takes two integers as input and returns an integer.
def func_4(numbers):
    return reduce(lambda a, b: func_2(a, b), numbers)
    #The program returns the result of applying the function `func_2` successively to all elements in the list `numbers` using the reduce function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a list of integers `numbers` as input and returns the result of applying the function `func_2` successively to all elements in the list `numbers` using the `reduce` function. The `reduce` function starts with the first two elements of `numbers`, applies `func_2` to them, then takes the result and applies `func_2` to it and the next element in the list, continuing this process until all elements in the list have been processed. The final result of this successive application of `func_2` is returned. If the list is empty, the function will raise a `TypeError` since `reduce` requires at least two arguments. If `func_2` is not defined, the function will also raise a `NameError`.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of minutes within the interval (0, 6] during which Vasya can descend to the subway and choose which girlfriend to visit.
def func_5(n):
    return n * (n + 1) / 2
    #The program returns the value of n * (n + 1) / 2, where n is an integer representing the number of minutes within the interval (0, 6] during which Vasya can descend to the subway and choose which girlfriend to visit.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts an integer `n` representing the number of minutes within the interval (0, 6] during which Vasya can descend to the subway and choose which girlfriend to visit. It calculates and returns the value of `n * (n + 1) / 2`. This formula represents the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling, as the input `n` is constrained to the interval (0, 6], and the function correctly computes the sum for any valid `n` in this range.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that a ≠ b, representing the frequencies of trains going to Masha's and Dasha's directions respectively.
def func_6(a, b):
    G = func_1(a, b)
    L = func_2(a, b)
    if (a < b) :
        M = (L / b - 1) * G
        D = L - M
        if (D > M) :
            return Ma
            #The program returns the value of \( M \cdot a \), where \( M = ((L / b) - 1) \cdot G \), \( G \) is the return value of `func_1(a, b)` and \( L \) is the return value of `func_2(a, b)`
        else :
            return Da
            #The program returns D*a, where D is L - M, and M is ((L / b) - 1) * G, and D <= M
    else :
        M = (L / a - 1) * G
        D = L - M
        if (D > M) :
            return Ma
            #The program returns \(D \times a\) where \(D = L - ((L / a - 1) \times G)\) and \(a \geq b\)
        else :
            return Da
            #`Da` where `D` is `L - M` and `M` is `(L / a - 1) * G`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers such that `a ≠ b`. It calculates values `G` and `L` using the functions `func_1(a, b)` and `func_2(a, b)` respectively. Based on the comparison between `a` and `b`, it computes `M` and `D` as follows:
1. If `a < b`, then \( M = \left(\frac{L}{b} - 1\right) \cdot G \) and \( D = L - M \).
2. If `a >= b`, then \( M = \left(\frac{L}{a} - 1\right) \cdot G \) and \( D = L - M \).

The function returns one of the following values:
- \( M \cdot a \) if \( D > M \),
- \( D \cdot a \) if \( D <= M \).

There are no explicit missing functionalities mentioned in the code, but the function does not return a value when neither condition (`D > M` nor `D <= M`) is met. This should be considered an edge case.
