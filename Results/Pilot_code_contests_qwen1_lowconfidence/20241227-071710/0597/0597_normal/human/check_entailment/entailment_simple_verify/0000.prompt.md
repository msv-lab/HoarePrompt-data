You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya the programmer lives in the middle of the Programming subway branch. He has two girlfriends: Dasha and Masha, who live at the different ends of the branch, each one is unaware of the other one's existence.

When Vasya has some free time, he goes to one of his girlfriends. He descends into the subway at some time, waits the first train to come and rides on it to the end of the branch to the corresponding girl. However, the trains run with different frequencies: a train goes to Dasha's direction every a minutes, but a train goes to Masha's direction every b minutes. If two trains approach at the same time, Vasya goes toward the direction with the lower frequency of going trains, that is, to the girl, to whose directions the trains go less frequently (see the note to the third sample).

We know that the trains begin to go simultaneously before Vasya appears. That is the train schedule is such that there exists a moment of time when the two trains arrive simultaneously.

Help Vasya count to which girlfriend he will go more often.

Input

The first line contains two integers a and b (a ≠ b, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 106).

Output

Print "Dasha" if Vasya will go to Dasha more frequently, "Masha" if he will go to Masha more frequently, or "Equal" if he will go to both girlfriends with the same frequency.

Examples

Input

3 7


Output

Dasha


Input

5 3


Output

Masha


Input

2 3


Output

Equal

Note

Let's take a look at the third sample. Let the trains start to go at the zero moment of time. It is clear that the moments of the trains' arrival will be periodic with period 6. That's why it is enough to show that if Vasya descends to the subway at a moment of time inside the interval (0, 6], he will go to both girls equally often. 

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 0 to 2, he leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the second minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 2 to 3, he leaves for Masha on the train that arrives by the third minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 3 to 4, he leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the fourth minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 4 to 6, he waits for both trains to arrive by the sixth minute and goes to Masha as trains go less often in Masha's direction.

In sum Masha and Dasha get equal time — three minutes for each one, thus, Vasya will go to both girlfriends equally often.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining to which girlfriend Vasya will go more often. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are not relevant to solving this problem. The function `func_5` is a helper function for calculating the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is also not needed for this problem.

The core logic required to solve this problem involves calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of the simultaneous arrivals of trains going to both directions. The function `func_6` attempts to do this but contains several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Simultaneous Arrival Time**: The calculation inside `func_6` is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that the simultaneous arrival time can be derived directly from the LCM and the individual intervals without properly considering the periodic nature of the schedules.

2. **Incorrect Comparison Logic**: The comparison logic inside `func_6` does not correctly handle the frequency comparison and the determination of which direction Vasya will choose.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the periodicity of the simultaneous arrivals and then determine how often Vasya will choose each direction based on these periods. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
import math

def more_frequent_girlfriend(a, b):
    # Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b
    lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
    
    # Calculate the time periods for each girl
    period_dasha = a
    period_masha = b
    
    # Determine how often Vasya chooses each direction
    if period_dasha < period_masha:
        return "Dasha"
    elif period_masha < period_dasha:
        return "Masha"
    else:
        return "Equal"

# Read input
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Determine the result
result = more_frequent_girlfriend(a, b)
print(result)
```

This corrected program accurately implements the logic required to determine which girlfriend Vasya will visit more often based on the given input.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

output = sys.stdout

b = int(S[1])
assert 1 <= a and a <= MAX
assert 1 <= b and b <= MAX
assert a != b
answer = func_6(a, b)
output.write('%s\n' % answer)
