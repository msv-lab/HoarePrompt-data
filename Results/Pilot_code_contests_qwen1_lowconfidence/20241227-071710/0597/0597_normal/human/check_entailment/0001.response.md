Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_6` is supposed to determine to which girlfriend Vasya will go more often based on the given intervals. However, the implementation does not correctly handle the logic of choosing between Dasha and Masha when two trains arrive at the same time. Additionally, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` do not seem to be used in the context of solving the problem, and their presence is unclear.

For instance, consider the case where `a = 3` and `b = 4`. According to the problem description, if two trains arrive at the same time, Vasya should choose the direction with the lower frequency of trains. In this case, since 3 < 4, Vasya should always go to Dasha when a train from both directions arrives simultaneously. However, the provided code does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to an incorrect output.

To properly solve the problem, the code needs to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then calculate how often Vasya would go to each girlfriend based on the intervals. The current implementation does not achieve this.
