Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_6` does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_6` calculates `M` and `D` based on the ratio of `L` (calculated by `func_2`) to `b` or `a`, but this does not align with the described behavior of Vasya choosing which girlfriend to visit based on the frequency of trains arriving.

According to the problem description, if two trains arrive at the same time, Vasya chooses the direction with the lower frequency of trains. However, the current implementation of `func_6` does not handle this scenario correctly. Instead, it seems to be calculating some kind of weighted average based on the GCD and LCM, which does not match the described behavior.

For example, consider the case where `a = 3` and `b = 6`. The GCD is 3, and the LCM is 6. According to the problem description, if Vasya descends during the interval where both trains arrive simultaneously (at 0 and 6), he should prefer Masha because her trains are less frequent. However, the current implementation does not reflect this preference.

To correctly implement the logic, the function should compare the intervals where Vasya can descend and choose the girlfriend based on the frequency of trains. For instance, if `a = 3` and `b = 6`, Vasya should go to Dasha 3 out of 6 times (when descending in the intervals [0, 2) and [3, 5)) and to Masha 3 out of 6 times (when descending in the intervals [2, 3) and [5, 6)). Therefore, the function should return "Equal" in this case, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.
