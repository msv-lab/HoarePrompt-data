Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the GCD of `a` and `b` is greater than 1 correctly. According to the problem description, if Vasya descends to the subway at a moment of time inside the interval (0, L], he will go to both girls equally often, where `L` is the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. However, the function `func_6` does not account for this properly.

To illustrate this, let's consider an example where `a = 4` and `b = 6`. The GCD of `4` and `6` is `2`, and the LCM of `4` and `6` is `12`. The code calculates `L` using `func_2(a, b)`, which is `12`. However, the logic in `func_6` does not handle the scenario where `L` is greater than the interval (0, 6]. Specifically, the code assumes that `D` and `M` are calculated based on the interval (0, 6], which is incorrect.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the issue:

1. For `a = 4` and `b = 6`:
   - `G = func_1(4, 6) = 2` (GCD of 4 and 6)
   - `L = func_2(4, 6) = 12` (LCM of 4 and 6)
   
2. In `func_6`:
   - Since `a < b`, the code calculates `M = ((12 / 6) - 1) * 2 = (2 - 1) * 2 = 2`
   - `D = 12 - 2 = 10`

3. The code then compares `D` and `M`:
   - `D > M` is false because `10 > 2` is false

4. Therefore, the code returns `Da` (Dasha), which is incorrect because Vasya should go to both girlfriends equally often over the interval (0, 12].

To fix this, the code needs to handle the LCM correctly and ensure that the logic accounts for the full interval of possible times Vasya can descend to the subway. The current implementation only considers the interval (0, 6], which is insufficient.
