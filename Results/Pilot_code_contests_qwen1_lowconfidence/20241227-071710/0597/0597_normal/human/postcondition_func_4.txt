The function `func_5` accepts an integer `n` representing the number of minutes within the interval (0, 6] during which Vasya can descend to the subway and choose which girlfriend to visit. It calculates and returns the value of `n * (n + 1) / 2`. This formula represents the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling, as the input `n` is constrained to the interval (0, 6], and the function correctly computes the sum for any valid `n` in this range.
