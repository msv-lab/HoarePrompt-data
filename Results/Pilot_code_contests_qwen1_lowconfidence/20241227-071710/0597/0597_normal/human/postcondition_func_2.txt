The function `func_3` accepts a list `numbers` as input and returns the result of applying the `func_1` function cumulatively to the items of `numbers` using the `reduce` function, starting with the first item as the initial accumulator value. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, but it is assumed that `func_1` is defined and works correctly. If `numbers` is an empty list, the function will return `None` because `reduce` cannot operate on an empty sequence.
