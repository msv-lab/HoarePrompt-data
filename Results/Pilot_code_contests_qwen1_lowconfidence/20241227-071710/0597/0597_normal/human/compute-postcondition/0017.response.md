Functionality: **The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers such that `a â‰  b`. It calculates values `G` and `L` using the functions `func_1(a, b)` and `func_2(a, b)` respectively. Based on the comparison between `a` and `b`, it computes `M` and `D` as follows:
1. If `a < b`, then \( M = \left(\frac{L}{b} - 1\right) \cdot G \) and \( D = L - M \).
2. If `a >= b`, then \( M = \left(\frac{L}{a} - 1\right) \cdot G \) and \( D = L - M \).

The function returns one of the following values:
- \( M \cdot a \) if \( D > M \),
- \( D \cdot a \) if \( D <= M \).

There are no explicit missing functionalities mentioned in the code, but the function does not return a value when neither condition (`D > M` nor `D <= M`) is met. This should be considered an edge case.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If both conditions (`D > M` and `D <= M`) are false, the function does not return a value. In practice, this should be handled by adding a default return statement to cover this scenario. For example, returning `None` or a specific error message could be appropriate.**

**Summary of the final state after the function concludes:**
- The function will either return `M * a` or `D * a`, where `M` and `D` are calculated based on the conditions described above. If the conditions do not hold true, the function's behavior is undefined unless a default return value is explicitly defined.**
