The code `D = L - M` assigns the value of `L - M` to `D`. From the initial state, we know that `L` is the return value of `func_2(a, b)` and `M` is calculated as `((L / b) - 1) * G`. Since `G` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, the value of `D` is determined by substituting these expressions.

So, the updated state includes:

- `D` is assigned the value `L - M`.
- `M` is `((L / b) - 1) * G`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer such that `a â‰  b`, `D` is `L - M`, `G` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, `L` is the return value of `func_2(a, b)`, `M` is `((L / b) - 1) * G`.**
