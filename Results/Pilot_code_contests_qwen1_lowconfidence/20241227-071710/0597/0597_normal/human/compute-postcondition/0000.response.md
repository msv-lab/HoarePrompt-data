The function `func_1(a, b)` is called with parameters `a` and `b`. However, the function itself is not defined in the given code snippet. Since no specific implementation of `func_1` is provided, we cannot determine what `G` will be. But we know that `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer such that `a â‰  b`, `G` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`**
