The code assigns the value `(L / a - 1) * G` to the variable `M`. Given the initial conditions:

- `a` is a positive integer,
- `b` is a positive integer such that `a ≠ b`,
- `G` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`,
- `L` is the return value of `func_2(a, b)`,
- and `a ≥ b`.

The variable `M` is calculated using these values. The states of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `G`, and `L`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer such that `a ≠ b`, `G` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, `L` is the return value of `func_2(a, b)`, and `a ≥ b`; `M` is \((L / a - 1) * G\)**.
