`L` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(a, b)`. The value of `a` is a positive integer, the value of `b` is a positive integer such that `a ≠ b`, and `G` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`. However, the specific values of `a`, `b`, `G`, and the return value of `func_2(a, b)` are not provided, so they remain as previously defined. 

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer such that `a ≠ b`, `G` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, `L` is the return value of `func_2(a, b)`**
