The function `func_4` accepts a list of integers `numbers` as input and returns the result of applying the function `func_2` successively to all elements in the list `numbers` using the `reduce` function. The `reduce` function starts with the first two elements of `numbers`, applies `func_2` to them, then takes the result and applies `func_2` to it and the next element in the list, continuing this process until all elements in the list have been processed. The final result of this successive application of `func_2` is returned. If the list is empty, the function will raise a `TypeError` since `reduce` requires at least two arguments. If `func_2` is not defined, the function will also raise a `NameError`.
