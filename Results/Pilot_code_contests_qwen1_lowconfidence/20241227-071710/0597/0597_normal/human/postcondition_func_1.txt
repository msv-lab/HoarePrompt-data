The function `func_2(a, b)` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` where `a â‰  b`. It calculates the value of `a / func_1(a, b) * b`, where `func_1(a, b)` returns a positive integer such that `a * b / func_1(a, b)` is an integer. The function then returns this calculated value. Potential edge cases include when `func_1(a, b)` returns 1 (the simplest case), or when `a` and `b` have no common factors other than 1, meaning `func_1(a, b)` would need to return their least common multiple. If `func_1(a, b)` does not exist or is not properly defined, the function will raise an error.
