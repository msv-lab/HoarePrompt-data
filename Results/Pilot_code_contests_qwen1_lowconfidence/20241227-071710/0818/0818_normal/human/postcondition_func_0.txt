The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers. It then iterates through the list `a` and updates elements in the list such that each element is not less than the previous one (`p`). During this process, it keeps track of the maximum difference (in terms of bit length) between consecutive elements in the list that were adjusted. After processing each test case, it calls `func_2` with this maximum difference. The function does not return anything explicitly, but it modifies the input list `a` in place and calls `func_2` with the computed maximum difference. Potential edge cases include empty lists or lists with a single element, which do not require any adjustments. If the list is already non-decreasing, no adjustments are made.
