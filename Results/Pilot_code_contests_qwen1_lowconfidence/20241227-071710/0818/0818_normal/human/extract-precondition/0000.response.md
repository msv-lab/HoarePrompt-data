Precondition: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers a, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The values of a_i are integers such that -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
