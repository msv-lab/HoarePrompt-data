Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `new_p` and the second element is `new_p`, the rest of the elements from index 2 to `n-1` are `new_p`, `mx` is 1, `p` is `new_p`, `i` is 2, and `a[n]` is unchanged. If `a[i] < p`, then `p` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition does not affect the state of the variables since there is no else part provided.***
