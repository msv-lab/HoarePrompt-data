The input line `a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` will take an input string, split it into individual elements, convert each element to an integer, and assign this list to `a`. This operation replaces the previous list `a` with a new list containing integers.

Initially:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list where the first element is `p` and the rest of the elements from index 1 to `n-1` are `p`
- `mx` is 0
- `p` is the first element of the list `a`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `a[n]` is unchanged

After executing the code:
- The original list `a` is replaced by a new list containing integers split from the input string.

Since the exact input values are not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in the new list `a`. However, we know the following:
- The length of the new list `a` will be `n`.
- The first element of the new list `a` will be an integer value (let's call it `new_p`).
- The rest of the elements from index 1 to `n-1` will also be `new_p`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of `n` integers, where the first element is `new_p` and the rest of the elements from index 1 to `n-1` are `new_p`
- `mx` is 0
- `p` is no longer relevant since it was the first element of the old list `a`, now the first element of `a` is `new_p`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `a[n]` is unchanged

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, where the first element is `new_p` and the rest of the elements from index 1 to `n-1` are `new_p`, `mx` is 0, `p` is `new_p`, `i` is `n-1`, `a[n]` is unchanged**
