The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` has the following impacts:

- `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` removes the key `'end'` from the dictionary `kwargs` and returns its value (which defaults to `\n` if `'end'` is not present). This value is then written to the file using `file.write()`.
- Since `kwargs` was not explicitly defined in the initial state and no value was provided for `'end'` in `kwargs`, it defaults to `\n`. Therefore, `\n` is written to the file.

The variables `t`, `args`, and `at_start` remain unchanged. Thus, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `args` is a non-empty list where each element is a tuple `(n, a)` with `n` being an integer and `a` being a list of `n` integers; the file contains the concatenated strings of all tuples `(n, a)` from `args`, with each tuple separated by the string value of `sep`; `at_start` is `False`; the file now contains an additional newline character (`\n`).**
