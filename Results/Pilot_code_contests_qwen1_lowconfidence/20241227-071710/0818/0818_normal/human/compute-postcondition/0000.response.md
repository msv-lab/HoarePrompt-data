The provided code snippet does not actually contain any executable statements that modify variables or perform operations. It only contains a comment indicating that the values will be printed to a stream or by default to `sys.stdout`. Therefore, no variables are modified, and the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers `a`, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5. The values of `a_i` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
