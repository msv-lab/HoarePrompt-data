Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, where the first element is `new_p` and the rest of the elements from index 1 to `n-1` are `new_p`, `mx` is 0, `p` is `new_p`, `i` is 1, `a[n]` is unchanged, the current value of `i` is 1, and the current value of `p` is `new_p` with the condition that `a[i]` is less than `p`***
