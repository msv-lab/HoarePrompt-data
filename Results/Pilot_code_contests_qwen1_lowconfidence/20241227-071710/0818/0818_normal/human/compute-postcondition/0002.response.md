The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. The only change is the assignment of `at_start`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers `a`; `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', with 'sep' set to ' ' and 'file' set to `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `True`**
