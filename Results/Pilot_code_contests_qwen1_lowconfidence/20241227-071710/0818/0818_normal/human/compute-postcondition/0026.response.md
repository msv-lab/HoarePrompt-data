The code snippet replaces the list `a` with a new list created from the input split into integers. Let's break down the impact:

1. The initial state of `t` is not used in the given code, so it remains unchanged.
2. The initial state of `n` is "an input integer," which remains unchanged as the code does not affect `n`.
3. The initial state of `a` is `[1, 1, 1, ..., 1]` (with `a[0] = 1` and `a[i] = 1` for `i >= 1`). After running the code, `a` is replaced with a new list created from the input, split into integers.
4. The initial state of `mx` is `1`, which remains unchanged as the code does not affect `mx`.
5. The initial state of `p` is `1`, which remains unchanged as the code does not affect `p`.

After executing the code, `a` is updated to a new list based on the input. Since the exact input is not specified, we cannot provide a specific value for `a`. However, we can describe the new state of `a` in terms of the input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input, `mx` is 1, `p` is 1**
