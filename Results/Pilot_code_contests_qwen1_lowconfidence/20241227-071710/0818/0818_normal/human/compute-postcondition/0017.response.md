The code writes the string representation of `x` to the file. The value of `x` is a tuple `(n, a)`. Since `x` is a tuple, the output written to the file will be a string representation of this tuple, which is `'(n, a)'`.

All other variables (`t`, `args`, `at_start`, and `sep`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `args` is a non-empty list with the next tuple `(n, a)` as the first element, `x` is the next tuple `(n, a)` in the list, `at_start` is `False`, and `sep` is written to the file since `not at_start` is `True`; the file now contains the string `'`(n, a)'`**.
