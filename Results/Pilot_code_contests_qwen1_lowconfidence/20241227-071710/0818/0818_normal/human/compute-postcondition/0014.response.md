Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify Initial Variables and Their States:**
   - `t`: A positive integer greater than 0.
   - `args`: A non-empty list where each element is a tuple `(n, a)`, with `n` being an integer and `a` being a list of `n` integers.
   - `x`: This variable will take the value of the current tuple `(n, a)` from the `args` list during each iteration.
   - `at_start`: Currently set to `False`.
   - `sep`: Not written to the file because `not at_start` is `True`.

2. **Determine the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each tuple in the `args` list using the variable `x`.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `x` takes the value of the current tuple `(n, a)` in each iteration, the state needs to change such that `x` refers to the next tuple in the `args` list.
   - The condition for continuing the loop is that there should still be tuples left in `args` for `x` to iterate over.

4. **Update the States:**
   - `t`: Remains unchanged as it is not directly involved in the loop.
   - `args`: Needs to refer to the next tuple in the list.
   - `x`: Will now be the next tuple `(n, a)` in the `args` list.
   - `at_start`: Since `x` is now the next tuple, `at_start` will be `False` until the first element in the new tuple is processed.
   - `sep`: Will be written to the file when `at_start` becomes `True` (i.e., when the first element in the tuple is processed).

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `args` is a non-empty list with the next tuple `(n, a)` as the first element, `x` is the next tuple `(n, a)` in the list, `at_start` is `False`, `sep` is not written to the file since `not at_start` is `True`**.
