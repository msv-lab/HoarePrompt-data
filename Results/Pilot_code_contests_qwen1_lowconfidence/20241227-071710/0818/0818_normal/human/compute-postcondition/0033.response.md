Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list where the first element remains `p` and the second element is now `p`, `mx` is the bit length of (`p` - `p`), `p` is the first element of the list `a`, `i` is 1. If `a[i]` (which is the third element of the list `a`) is less than `p`, then the third element of the list `a` is set to `p`. Otherwise, the third element of the list `a` remains unchanged.***
