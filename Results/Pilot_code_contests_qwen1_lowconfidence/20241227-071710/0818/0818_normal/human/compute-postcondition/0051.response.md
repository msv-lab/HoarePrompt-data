`p` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, which is `new_p`. The value of `t`, `n`, `a`, `mx`, `i`, and `a[n]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, where the first element is `new_p` and the rest of the elements from index 1 to `n-1` are `new_p`, `mx` is 0, `p` is `new_p`, `i` is `n-1`, `a[n]` is unchanged.
