The code assigns the value of `a[i]` to `p`. Given that `i` is 3, `a[i]` is `a[3]`, which is `new_p`. Therefore, `p` is updated to `new_p`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `new_p` and the second element is `new_p`, the rest of the elements from index 2 to `n-1` are `new_p`, `mx` is 1, `p` is `new_p`, `i` is 3, `a[3]` is `new_p`.**
