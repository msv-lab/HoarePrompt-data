Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `args` is a non-empty list where each element is a tuple `(n, a)` with `n` being an integer and `a` being a list of `n` integers; the file contains the concatenated strings of all tuples `(n, a)` from `args`, with each tuple separated by the string value of `sep`; `at_start` is `False`; the file now contains an additional newline character (`\n`); the 'flush' parameter was popped from kwargs and its value is either `True` or `False`, depending on whether the `flush` parameter was provided and set to `True` or not***
