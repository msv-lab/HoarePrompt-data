`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. However, the initial value of `sep` is not specified, so it remains undefined. The other variables (`t`, `args`, `x`, `at_start`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `args` is a non-empty list, each element in `args` is a tuple `(n, a)`, where `n` is an integer and `a` is a list of `n` integers; the value of `x` is written to the file as a string; `at_start` is `False`; `sep` is written to the file.
