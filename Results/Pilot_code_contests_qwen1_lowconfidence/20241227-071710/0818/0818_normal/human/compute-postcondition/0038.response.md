Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list where the first element is `p` and the second element is `p`, `mx` is 0, `p` is the first element of the list `a`, `i` is 2, `a[2]` is `p`. If `a[2] < p`, then `a[2]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition does not apply since there is no else part specified in the code.***
