The code `p = a[i]` assigns the value of `a[i]` to `p`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, and `a[3]` is equal to `a[0]`. Since `a[0]` is `p`, `a[3]` is also `p`.

So, `p` is assigned the value of `a[3]`, which is `p`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 3, `a` is a list where the first and second elements are both `p`, `mx` is 0, `p` is the first element of the list `a`, `i` is 3, `a[2]` is `p`, `a[3]` is `p`, and `p` is `p`.**
