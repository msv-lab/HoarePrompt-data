The code assigns the value of `a[i]` to `p`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `p` is set to `a[2]`. Since `a[2]` is initially `p`, `p` is set to `p`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list where the first element is `p` and the second element is `p`, `mx` is 0, `p` is the first element of the list `a`, `i` is 2, `a[2]` is `p`.**
