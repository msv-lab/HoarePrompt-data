The code `mx = 0` assigns the value 0 to `mx`. This changes the value of `mx` from 1 (the initial value) to 0. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input, `mx` is 0, `p` is 1**
