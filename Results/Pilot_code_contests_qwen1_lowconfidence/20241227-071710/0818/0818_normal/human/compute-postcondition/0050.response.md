The code `mx = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `mx`. This does not affect any other variables. The initial conditions for the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, where the first element is `new_p` and the rest of the elements from index 1 to `n-1` are `new_p`, `mx` is 0, `p` is `new_p`, `i` is `n-1`, `a[n]` is unchanged**
