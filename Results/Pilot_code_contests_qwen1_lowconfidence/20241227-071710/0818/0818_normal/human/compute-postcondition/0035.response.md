Let's break down the given information and the loop to determine the required states at the start of the next iteration.

### Given Information:
- State at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `t` is greater than 0
  - `n` is an input integer
  - `a` is a list where the first element is `p` and the second element is `p`
  - `mx` is the bit length of (`p` - `p`)
  - `p` is the first element of the list `a`
  - `i` is 1
  - `a[2]` is unchanged

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - At the start of the first iteration (`i = 1`), `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer, so it remains as is.
3. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is still an input integer.
   - `a` is a list where the first element is `p` and the second element is `p`.
   - `mx` is the bit length of (`p` - `p`).
   - `p` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `a[2]` is unchanged (so it retains its value from the previous iteration).

### Adjusting States for Next Iteration:
- Since `i` starts at 1, the loop condition `i < n` must hold true for the loop to continue.
- After the first iteration (`i = 1`), `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given these points, we need to update the state such that `i` is 2 and the loop can continue if `i < n`.

### Updated State:
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `n` remains the same (unchanged).
- `a` remains unchanged (first element is `p` and second element is `p`).
- `mx` remains unchanged (bit length of (`p` - `p`)).
- `p` remains the first element of the list `a`.
- `i` becomes 2.
- `a[2]` remains unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list where the first element is `p` and the second element is `p`, `mx` is the bit length of (`p` - `p`), `p` is the first element of the list `a`, `i` is 2, `a[2]` is unchanged**
