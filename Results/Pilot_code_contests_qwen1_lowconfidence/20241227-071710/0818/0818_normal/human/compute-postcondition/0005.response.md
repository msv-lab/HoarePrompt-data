`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file, but does not change the value of `sep` itself or any other variable. The state of `t`, `args`, and `at_start` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `args` is a list with at least one element, and each element in `args` is a tuple `(n, a)` where `n` is an integer and `a` is a list of `n` integers. The value of `at_start` is `False`. No changes to variables after executing the code.**
