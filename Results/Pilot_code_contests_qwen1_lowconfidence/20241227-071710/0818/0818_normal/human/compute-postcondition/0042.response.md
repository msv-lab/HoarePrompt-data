The code `a[i] = p` assigns the value of `p` to the element `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 3 and `p` is the first element of the list `a`, which is also `a[0]`, this assignment will set `a[3]` to the value of `a[0]`.

The initial state is as follows:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 3
- `a` is a list where the first and second elements are both `p`, so `a[0]` and `a[1]` are both `p`
- `mx` is 0
- `p` is the first element of the list `a`, so `p = a[0]`
- `i` is 3
- `a[2]` is `p`

After the code `a[i] = p` is executed, the list `a` will have `a[3]` updated to `a[0]`, while all other values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 3, `a` is a list where the first and second elements are both `p`, `mx` is 0, `p` is the first element of the list `a`, `i` is 3, `a[2]` is `p`, and `a[3]` is `a[0]`**.
