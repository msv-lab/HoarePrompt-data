Let's analyze the loop step-by-step based on the provided output states and the loop code:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `a`.
- `a` is a list of integers.

### Loop Analysis:

#### Loop Body Breakdown:
1. **Input and Initialization:**
   ```python
   n = int(input())
   a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
   ```
   - After each iteration, `n` is set to an integer input.
   - `a` is updated to a new list based on another input.

2. **Variables Inside the Loop:**
   ```python
   mx = 0
   p = a[0]
   ```
   - `mx` is initialized to 0.
   - `p` is set to the first element of `a`.

3. **Main Logic Inside the Loop:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
       if a[i] < p:
           mx = max(mx, (p - a[i]).bit_length())
           a[i] = p
       p = a[i]
   func_2(mx)
   ```
   - `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each `i`, if `a[i] < p`, update `mx` and set `a[i]` to `p`.
   - Update `p` to `a[i]`.

### Observations from Example Output States:
- **After 1st Iteration:**
  - `t > 0`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] = 1` and `a[i] = 1` for `i >= 1`, `mx` is 1, `p` is 1.
- **After 2nd Iteration:**
  - `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list where the first element is `p` and the rest of the elements from index 1 to `n-1` are `p`, `mx` is 0, `p` is the first element of the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `a[n]` is unchanged.
- **After 3rd Iteration:**
  - `t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where all elements from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to `new_p`, `mx` is passed to `func_2`, `p` is `new_p`, `i` is `n`, and `a[n]` is unchanged.

### Final Output State After All Iterations:

- **General Case:**
  - If the loop executes `t` times, `t` is a positive integer.
  - `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`.
  - `a` is a list of integers.
  - After processing all inputs, `a` will be such that all elements except possibly the first one will be equal to the last value of `p` (which is `a[n-1]`).
  - `mx` will be the maximum bit length difference encountered during the loop execution, starting from the first element and comparing subsequent elements.
  - `p` will be the last element processed, i.e., `a[n-1]`.

### Output State:
**Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers where all elements except possibly the first one are equal to the last value of `p`, `mx` is the maximum bit length difference between consecutive elements, `p` is the last element processed in the loop.**
