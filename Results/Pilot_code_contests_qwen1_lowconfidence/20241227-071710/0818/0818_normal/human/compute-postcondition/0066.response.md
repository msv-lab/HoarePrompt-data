Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `new_p` and the second element is `new_p`, the rest of the elements from index 2 to `n-1` are `new_p`, `mx` is 1, `p` is `new_p`, `i` is 3, `a[3]` is `new_p`. If `a[3] < new_p`, the condition remains unchanged; otherwise, the condition also remains unchanged since there is no else part that changes anything.***
