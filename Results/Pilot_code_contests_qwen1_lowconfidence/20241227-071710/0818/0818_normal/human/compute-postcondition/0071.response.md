The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `a`.
- `a` is a list of integers representing the array itself, where each element of `a` is an integer in the range [-10^9, 10^9].

The function has two cases for its output:
- Case_1: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, the function processes the array `a` of length `n` and returns some result based on the array (the specific result is not detailed here).
- Case_2: The function handles an error or specific condition related to the input but is not detailed in the given information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the array `a`, and `a` is the array itself. For each test case, the function processes the array `a` and returns a result based on the array, and it also handles specific conditions or errors as defined in the cases.
