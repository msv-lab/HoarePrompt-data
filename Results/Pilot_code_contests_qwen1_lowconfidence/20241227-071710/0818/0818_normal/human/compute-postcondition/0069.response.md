The function `func_2(mx)` is called, but the content of this function is not provided in the initial state or the code snippet. Since the function's behavior is not defined, we cannot determine the exact changes it will make to the variables. However, we know that `mx` is passed as an argument to the function. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where all elements from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to `new_p`, `mx` is passed to `func_2`, `p` is `new_p`, `i` is `n`, and `a[n]` is unchanged.**
