The function `func_2` accepts no explicit parameters. However, it implies that the function will process input data through some form of external or predefined input mechanism (e.g., command-line arguments, file input, etc.). The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers `a`. The function returns a result based on the processed data.

Given the constraints, the function will handle up to 10,000 test cases, and each test case will have up to 100,000 integers. The integers in the list `a` can range from -10^9 to 10^9. The sum of all integers across all test cases will not exceed 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes up to 10,000 test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers `a`. It returns a result based on the processed data.**
