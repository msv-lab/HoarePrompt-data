The function `func_2(mx)` is called with `mx` as an argument. However, the function itself is not defined in the provided code snippet, so no changes are made to the variables due to this function call. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list where the first element is `p` and the rest of the elements from index 1 to `n-1` are `p`, `mx` is 0, `p` is the first element of the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `a[n]` is unchanged.**
