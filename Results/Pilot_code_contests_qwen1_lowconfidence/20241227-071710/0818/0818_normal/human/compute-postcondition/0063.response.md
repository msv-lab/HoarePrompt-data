Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is greater than 0
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `new_p` and the second element is `new_p`, the rest of the elements from index 2 to `n-1` are `new_p`
   - `mx` is 1
   - `p` is `new_p`
   - `i` is 2
   - `a[n]` is unchanged

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means the loop will run while `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current State:**
   - `i` is currently 2.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration).

5. **Other States:**
   - Since the loop body is omitted, no other state changes are explicitly mentioned in the given information. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `mx`, `p`, and `a[n]` remain unchanged.

6. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` should be 3.
   - The value of `n` remains at least 2.
   - The list `a` remains as defined, with the first two elements being `new_p` and the rest being `new_p`.
   - `mx` remains 1.
   - `p` remains `new_p`.
   - `a[n]` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `new_p` and the second element is `new_p`, the rest of the elements from index 2 to `n-1` are `new_p`, `mx` is 1, `p` is `new_p`, `i` is 3, and `a[n]` is unchanged.**
