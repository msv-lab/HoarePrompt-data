`n` is reassigned the value of `int(input())`, which converts the user's input to an integer. The previous value of `n` as an input integer is replaced by the new integer value. All other variables remain unchanged based on their initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list where the first element is `p` and the rest of the elements from index 1 to `n-1` are `p`, `mx` is 0, `p` is the first element of the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `a[n]` is unchanged**
