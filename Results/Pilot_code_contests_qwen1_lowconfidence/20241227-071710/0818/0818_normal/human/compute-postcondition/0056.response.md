Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers (where the first element is `new_p` and the rest of the elements from index 1 to `n-1` are `new_p`, `mx` is 1, `p` is `new_p`, `i` is 1, and `a[n]` is unchanged). If `a[i] < p`, then `a[i]` is updated to `new_p` and `mx` remains 1. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
