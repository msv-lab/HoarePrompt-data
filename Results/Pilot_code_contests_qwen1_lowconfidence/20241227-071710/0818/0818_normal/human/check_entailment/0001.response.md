Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of seconds required to make the array non-decreasing. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the array needs to be adjusted in multiple places simultaneously to achieve a non-decreasing order.

Let's consider the example from the problem description:

### Example Analysis:
- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  4
  1 7 6 5
  5
  1 2 3 4 5
  2
  0 -4
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  2
  0
  3
  ```

#### Case 1: `1 7 6 5`
- After 1st second, we can make the array `[1, 7, 7, 5]` by updating the 3rd element.
- After 2nd second, we can make the array `[1, 7, 7, 8]` by updating the 4th element.
- Thus, the output should be `2`.

The provided program seems to calculate the maximum bit length difference, which is correct for the first part, but it does not ensure that the array becomes non-decreasing in the minimum number of seconds.

#### Case 2: `1 2 3 4 5`
- The array is already non-decreasing, so the output should be `0`.

#### Case 3: `0 -4`
- We need to update the second element to be at least `0`, so the array becomes `[0, 0]`.
- This requires 3 seconds (since `2^2 = 4`).

However, the provided program does not correctly handle these scenarios. Here is a revised version of the program that should meet the problem description:

```python
from __future__ import division, print_function
import os
import sys
from io import BytesIO, IOBase

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        mx = 0
        p = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] < p:
                diff = p - a[i]
                mx = max(mx, diff.bit_length())
                a[i] = p
            p = a[i]
        print(mx)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_1()
```

This revised program calculates the required number of seconds correctly by finding the maximum bit length difference and ensuring the array becomes non-decreasing in the minimum number of seconds.
