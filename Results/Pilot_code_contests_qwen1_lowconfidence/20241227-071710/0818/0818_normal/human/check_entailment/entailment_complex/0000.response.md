Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not compute the minimum number of seconds required to make the array non-decreasing as stated in the problem description. Instead, it only ensures that no element in the array is less than the previous one by adjusting elements as needed. This approach does not necessarily minimize the number of seconds required.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
3
4
1 7 6 5
5
1 2 3 4 5
2
0 -4
```

The expected output is:
```
2
0
3
```

However, the provided code would produce the following output:
```
2
0
2
```

This discrepancy arises because the code in `func_1` updates elements to ensure the array is non-decreasing without considering the optimal way to achieve this in the minimum number of seconds. Specifically, the code only updates elements to match the previous element if necessary, but it does not account for the fact that adding a smaller power of 2 could potentially allow the array to become non-decreasing more quickly.

A correct implementation would involve finding the smallest number of seconds required to ensure that each element is at least as large as the previous one by incrementing elements using powers of 2 optimally. This involves calculating the bit lengths of the differences and ensuring the cumulative effect of these increments is minimal.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
