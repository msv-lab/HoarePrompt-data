You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have an array a of length n. For every positive integer x you are going to perform the following operation during the x-th second:

  * Select some distinct indices i_{1}, i_{2}, …, i_{k} which are between 1 and n inclusive, and add 2^{x-1} to each corresponding position of a. Formally, a_{i_{j}} := a_{i_{j}} + 2^{x-1} for j = 1, 2, …, k. Note that you are allowed to not select any indices at all.



You have to make a nondecreasing as fast as possible. Find the smallest number T such that you can make the array nondecreasing after at most T seconds.

Array a is nondecreasing if and only if a_{1} ≤ a_{2} ≤ … ≤ a_{n}.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}) — the length of array a. It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases in the input does not exceed 10^{5}.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_{1}, a_{2}, …, a_{n} (-10^{9} ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^{9}).

Output

For each test case, print the minimum number of seconds in which you can make a nondecreasing.

Example

Input


3
4
1 7 6 5
5
1 2 3 4 5
2
0 -4


Output


2
0
3

Note

In the first test case, if you select indices 3, 4 at the 1-st second and 4 at the 2-nd second, then a will become [1, 7, 7, 8]. There are some other possible ways to make a nondecreasing in 2 seconds, but you can't do it faster.

In the second test case, a is already nondecreasing, so answer is 0.

In the third test case, if you do nothing at first 2 seconds and select index 2 at the 3-rd second, a will become [0, 0].

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):

        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        mx = 0
        p = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] < p:
                mx = max(mx, (p - a[i]).bit_length())
                a[i] = p
            p = a[i]
        func_2(mx)

#Function 2:
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of seconds required to make the array non-decreasing. The program seems to attempt to fix the array by ensuring no element is less than its predecessor, but it does not account for the operations described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program tries to equalize elements without considering the addition of \(2^{x-1}\) for each second \(x\). 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
1 7 6 5
```
The expected output is `2`, but the program's logic does not correctly determine this. The program tries to make all elements equal to the last element before it reaches the point where they would naturally be in non-decreasing order, without considering the binary nature of the operations.

To fix this, the program needs to determine the highest bit position where a gap exists and ensure that all necessary additions are made within that time frame. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
