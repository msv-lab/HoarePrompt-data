Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the solution to make the array non-decreasing as fast as possible. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not update the array `a` to achieve the desired non-decreasing order within the minimum number of seconds. Instead, it only ensures that each element is not less than the previous one, which is not sufficient to minimize the number of seconds required to make the array non-decreasing.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4
  1 7 6 5
  ```

The expected output should be `2`, as explained in the problem statement. However, the current implementation will not produce this result. Hereâ€™s why:

- In the first iteration, the code sets `p` to `1` and checks the next element `7`. Since `7 >= 1`, no adjustment is made.
- In the second iteration, `p` is still `1`, and the code checks `6`. Since `6 >= 1`, no adjustment is made.
- In the third iteration, `p` is still `1`, and the code checks `5`. Since `5 < 1`, the code sets `mx` to `2` (because `(1 - 5).bit_length() == 2`) and sets `a[3]` to `1`.
- The final array `a` becomes `[1, 7, 6, 1]`, which is not non-decreasing.

To fix this, the code needs to calculate the maximum bit length difference between consecutive elements that are out of order and apply the necessary adjustments in the minimum number of steps. The current implementation does not achieve this.
