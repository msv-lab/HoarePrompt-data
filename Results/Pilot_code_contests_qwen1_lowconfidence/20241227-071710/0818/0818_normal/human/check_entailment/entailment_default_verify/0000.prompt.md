You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have an array a of length n. For every positive integer x you are going to perform the following operation during the x-th second:

  * Select some distinct indices i_{1}, i_{2}, …, i_{k} which are between 1 and n inclusive, and add 2^{x-1} to each corresponding position of a. Formally, a_{i_{j}} := a_{i_{j}} + 2^{x-1} for j = 1, 2, …, k. Note that you are allowed to not select any indices at all.



You have to make a nondecreasing as fast as possible. Find the smallest number T such that you can make the array nondecreasing after at most T seconds.

Array a is nondecreasing if and only if a_{1} ≤ a_{2} ≤ … ≤ a_{n}.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}) — the length of array a. It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases in the input does not exceed 10^{5}.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_{1}, a_{2}, …, a_{n} (-10^{9} ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^{9}).

Output

For each test case, print the minimum number of seconds in which you can make a nondecreasing.

Example

Input


3
4
1 7 6 5
5
1 2 3 4 5
2
0 -4


Output


2
0
3

Note

In the first test case, if you select indices 3, 4 at the 1-st second and 4 at the 2-nd second, then a will become [1, 7, 7, 8]. There are some other possible ways to make a nondecreasing in 2 seconds, but you can't do it faster.

In the second test case, a is already nondecreasing, so answer is 0.

In the third test case, if you do nothing at first 2 seconds and select index 2 at the 3-rd second, a will become [0, 0].
Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
import os
import sys
from io import BytesIO, IOBase
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        mx = 0
        p = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] < p:
                mx = max(mx, (p - a[i]).bit_length())
                a[i] = p
            p = a[i]
        func_2(mx)

#Function 2:
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of seconds required to make the array non-decreasing. The program seems to attempt to fix the array by ensuring no element is less than its predecessor, but it does not account for the operations described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program tries to equalize elements without considering the addition of \(2^{x-1}\) for each second \(x\). 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
1 7 6 5
```
The expected output is `2`, but the program's logic does not correctly determine this. The program tries to make all elements equal to the last element before it reaches the point where they would naturally be in non-decreasing order, without considering the binary nature of the operations.

To fix this, the program needs to determine the highest bit position where a gap exists and ensure that all necessary additions are made within that time frame. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers `a`. It concatenates these tuples `(n, a)` into a single string, separating each tuple with the specified separator `sep`. After processing all test cases, it writes an additional newline character to the output file (or stream) and flushes the file if the `flush` parameter is set to `True`. The function does not explicitly return any value but modifies the output file or stream directly. Potential edge cases include handling an empty `args` list or when `sep` or `end` are not provided. However, the code assumes that `args` is non-empty and `sep` and `end` are always provided, which might lead to issues if these assumptions are not met.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
