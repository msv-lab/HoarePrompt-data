Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code in `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum number of seconds needed to make the array non-decreasing. Specifically, the logic inside the loop to update elements in the array and determine the maximum difference is incorrect. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Updating Elements**: The code updates elements in the array to ensure they are not less than the previous element, but it does not account for the fact that we can add different powers of 2 to different indices to make the array non-decreasing in the minimum number of steps. Instead, it simply sets each element to the value of the previous element if it is smaller, which is not optimal.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Difference**: The variable `mx` is calculated as the maximum difference (in terms of bit length) between consecutive elements that were adjusted. However, this does not help in determining the minimum number of seconds required to make the array non-decreasing. The actual logic to find the minimum number of seconds should involve considering the maximum difference between any two elements in the array and determining how many steps are needed to make this difference zero by adding appropriate powers of 2.

To illustrate with an example, consider the input:
```
3
4
1 7 6 5
5
1 2 3 4 5
2
0 -4
```

The correct output should be:
```
2
0
3
```

However, the given code would produce incorrect results because it does not correctly compute the minimum number of seconds needed to make the array non-decreasing. For instance, in the first test case `[1, 7, 6, 5]`, the correct minimum number of seconds is 2, but the code incorrectly calculates it as 0 because it does not account for the optimal way to add powers of 2.
