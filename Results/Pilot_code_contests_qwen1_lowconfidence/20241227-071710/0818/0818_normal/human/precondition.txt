t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is a positive integer representing the length of the array a, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The sum of all values of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. Additionally, a is a list of n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each element a_i in the array.
