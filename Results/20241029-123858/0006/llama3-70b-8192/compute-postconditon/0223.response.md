Given the `while True` loop, the loop will always execute regardless of any conditions. Therefore, to proceed with the next iteration, we simply need to repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **_ is an input integer increased by 3, a and b are integers, n and x are input integers with x greater than 0, d contains the first, second, and third input integers di, di, di sorted in descending order, h contains the first, second, and third input integers hi, hi, hi sorted in ascending order, ans is the number of iterations executed, iterator is an iterator of pairs from d and h with more elements available, di and hi are the next values from iterator**
