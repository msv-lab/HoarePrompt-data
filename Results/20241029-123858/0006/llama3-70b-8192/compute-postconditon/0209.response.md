Precondition: _ is an input integer increased by 3, `a` and `b` are integers, `n` and `x` are input integers with `x` greater than 0, `d` contains the first, second, and third input integers `di`, `di`, `di` sorted in descending order, `h` contains the first, second, and third input integers `hi`, `hi`, `hi` sorted in ascending order, `ans` is increased by 2, `iterator` is an iterator of pairs from `d` and `h` with more elements available, `di`, `hi` are the next values from `iterator` assigned to `di` and `hi` respectively, `x` is decreased by the minimum of `di` and the original `x` twice, if `x` is greater than 0, `x` is increased by the next value from `iterator` assigned to `hi`, and `x` is now increased by `hi`. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Program fragment:
```
if x <= 0:
    break

```
Postcondition for if body: _ is an input integer increased by 3, `a` and `b` are integers, `n` and `x` are input integers with `x` greater than 0, `d` contains the first, second, and third input integers `di`, `di`, `di` sorted in descending order, `h` contains the first, second, and third input integers `hi`, `hi`, `hi` sorted in ascending order, `ans` is increased by 2, `iterator` is an iterator of pairs from `d` and `h` with more elements available, `di`, `hi` are the next values from `iterator` assigned to `di` and `hi` respectively, `x` is decreased by the minimum of `di` and the original `x` twice, if `x` is greater than 0, `x` is increased by the next value from `iterator` assigned to `hi`, and `x` is now increased by `hi`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Postcondition for else body: there is no else part in the code
