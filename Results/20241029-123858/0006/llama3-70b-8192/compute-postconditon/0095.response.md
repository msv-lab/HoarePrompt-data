Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `_` remains equal to `n`; `n` is an input integer; `x` is decremented by `min(di, x)`; `d` is sorted in reverse order; `h` remains an empty list; `ans` is the count of how many times the loop executed plus 2; `iterator` has more elements; `di` and `hi` are the next elements from `iterator`. If `x` is greater than 0, it is incremented by `hi`. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, the loop or the current block of statements is terminated.**
