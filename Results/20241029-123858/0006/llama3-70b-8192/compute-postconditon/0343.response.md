According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is increased by 1. This means that `_` was initially less than 0, but after being increased by 1, it may no longer be less than 0. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `_` must still be less than 0 after being increased by 1. Therefore, before being increased by 1, `_` must be less than -1.

State: **variable `_` is increased by 1 and `_` is less than -1**
