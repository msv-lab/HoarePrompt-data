To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition and the given states.

### Loop Condition:
```python
while _ < 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### State at the end of the previous iteration:
- If `x` is positive, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is printed.
- `_` is `n` increased by 4 and is less than 0, incremented by 1.
- `a` and `b` are integers.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `d` is a list containing `di`.
- `h` contains `hi`.
- `ans` is the number of iterations executed before `x` becomes less than or equal to 0 or the iterator is exhausted.
- `iterator` is exhausted or advanced by the number of pairs fetched.
- `di` and `hi` are input integers.

### Analysis:
We need to focus on the variable `_` because it appears in the loop condition. For the loop to execute, `_` must be less than 0.

### Current State of `_`:
- `_` is `n` increased by 4 and is less than 0, incremented by 1.

This implies:
1. `_` is initially `n + 4` and is less than 0.
2. `_` is then incremented by 1.

For `_` to remain less than 0 after incrementing by 1, it must satisfy:
\[ n + 4 + 1 < 0 \]
\[ n + 5 < 0 \]
\[ n < -5 \]

Thus, the value of `n` needs to be less than -5 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
Since we are not required to modify any other variables, the state should reflect this necessary condition for `n`.

State: **If `x` is positive, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is printed. `_` is `n` increased by 4, incremented by 1 and is less than 0, `a` and `b` are integers, `n` is less than -5, `x` is an input integer, `d` is a list containing `di`, `h` contains `hi`, `ans` is the number of iterations executed before `x` becomes less than or equal to 0 or the iterator is exhausted, `iterator` is exhausted or advanced by the number of pairs fetched, `di` and `hi` are input integers.**
