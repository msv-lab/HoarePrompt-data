Precondition: `a` and `b` are integers
Program fragment:
```
if a > b:
    a, b = b, a
else:
    a, b = a + 1, b - 1
```
Postcondition for if body: The integer `a` is swapped with `b` if `a` is greater than `b`.
Postcondition for else body: The integer `a` is incremented by 1 and `b` is decremented by 1 if `a` is not greater than `b`.
Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are integers. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, `a` is incremented by 1 and `b` is decremented by 1.**
