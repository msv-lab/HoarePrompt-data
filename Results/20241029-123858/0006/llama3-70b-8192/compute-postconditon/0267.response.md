Precondition: `x` is a positive integer, `y` is an integer
Program fragment:
```
if x % 2 == 0:
    y = y * 2
elif x % 3 == 0:
    y = y * 3
else:
    y = y + 1
```
Postcondition for if body: If `x` is even, `y` is multiplied by 2.
Postcondition for else body: If `x` is divisible by 3, `y` is multiplied by 3. Otherwise, `y` is incremented by 1.
Postcondition: **`x` is a positive integer, `y` is an integer. If `x` is even (i.e., `x % 2 == 0`), then `y` is multiplied by 2. If `x` is not even but divisible by 3 (i.e., `x % 3 == 0`), then `y` is multiplied by 3. Otherwise, `y` is incremented by 1.**
