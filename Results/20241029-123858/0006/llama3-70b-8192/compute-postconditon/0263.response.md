`x` is increased by the value of `hi`. The previous state of `x` is that it is decreased by the minimum value between `di` and `x`, but the specific values of `x`, `di`, and `hi` are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: variable `x` is increased by the value of `hi`.

Output State: **variable `x` is increased by the value of `hi`**
