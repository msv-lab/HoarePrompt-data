Precondition: `num` is an integer
Program fragment:
```
if num % 2 == 0:
    num += 3
elif num % 3 == 0:
    num += 2
else:
    num += 1
```
Postcondition for if body: Integer `num` is increased by 3
Postcondition for else body: If `num` is divisible by 3, `num` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `num` is increased by 1.
Postcondition: **`num` is an integer. If `num` is divisible by 2 (i.e., an even number), it is increased by 3. If `num` is not divisible by 2 but is divisible by 3, it is increased by 2. Otherwise, `num` is increased by 1.**
