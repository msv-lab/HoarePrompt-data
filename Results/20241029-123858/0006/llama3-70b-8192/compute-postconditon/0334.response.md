Let's proceed with the given task, maintaining the provided format and ensuring the completeness of the postconditions.

Precondition: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer
Program fragment:
```
if a > b:
    a = a + b
elif a == b:
    b = b - a
else:
    a = a * b

```
Postcondition for if body: Integer `a` is updated to the sum of `a` and `b`.
Postcondition for else body: If `a` equals `b`, `b` is updated to 0. Otherwise, `a` is updated to the product of `a` and `b`.
Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are integers. If `a` is greater than `b`, `a` is updated to the sum of `a` and `b`. If `a` equals `b`, `b` is updated to 0. Otherwise, `a` is updated to the product of `a` and `b`.**
