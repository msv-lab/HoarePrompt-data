To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the condition `x > 0` holds true. Let's analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration and the condition of the `while` loop step by step.

Given State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `_` remains equal to `n`
- `n` is an input integer
- `x` is greater than `di` after being decreased by `min(di, x)`
- `d` is sorted in reverse order
- `h` remains an empty list
- `ans` is 3
- `iterator` is an iterator of zipped `d` and `h`
- `di` is the next element from `d`
- `hi` is the next element from `h`

Loop Condition:
```
while x > 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than 0 (`x > 0`).
2. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is greater than `di` after being decreased by `min(di, x)`. This means `x` is still greater than 0 after the decrease because `x > di`.
3. If `x` is greater than 0, `x` is then increased by `hi`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `x` must remain greater than 0. Since we were given that `x` was greater than `di` after the decrease and then increased by `hi`, and `hi` is the next element from an empty list `h`, the increase by `hi` does not change `x` (since `hi` is likely 0 in this case).

Thus, we don't need to change the states related to `di`, `hi`, or any other variable because `x` is already greater than 0 at the end of the last iteration.

### Conclusion:
No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time because `x` is already greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `_` remains equal to `n`; `n` is an input integer; `x` is greater than `di` after being decreased by `min(di, x)`; `d` is sorted in reverse order; `h` remains an empty list; `ans` is 3; `iterator` is an iterator of zipped `d` and `h`; `di` is the next element from `d`; `hi` is the next element from `h`**
