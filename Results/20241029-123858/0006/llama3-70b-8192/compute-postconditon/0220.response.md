Precondition: `x` is an integer, `y` is zero.
Program fragment:
```
if x > 0:
    y = x * 2
else:
    y = x + 5
```
Postcondition for if body: `x` is an integer, if `x` > 0, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`.
Postcondition for else body: If `x` is less than or equal to 0, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.
Postcondition: **`x` is an integer and `y` is initially zero. If `x` is greater than 0, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.**
