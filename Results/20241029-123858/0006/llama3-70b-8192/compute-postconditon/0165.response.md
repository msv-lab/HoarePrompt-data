The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a conditional statement. Since the initial state is unknown, and the values of the variables are unknown, the output state will reflect that we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement without any change in variable values.

Output State: **the state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
