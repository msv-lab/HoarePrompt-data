`hi` is appended to the list `h`. Given the initial state, `h` already contains `hi` twice, so after appending `hi` again, `h` will contain `hi` three times. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`_` is an input integer increased by 2 where the input integer is less than -2, `a` and `b` are integers, `n` and `x` are input integers, `d` contains the input integer `di` appended, `h` contains the input integers `hi`, `hi`, and `hi` appended, `di` and `hi` are input integers split from input, `d` contains the input integer `di` appended again**
