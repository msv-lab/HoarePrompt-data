`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `_` remains equal to `n`; `n` is an input integer; `x` is decremented by `min(di, x)` and remains positive; `d` is sorted in reverse order; `h` remains an empty list; `ans` is the count of how many times the loop executed plus 2; `iterator` has more elements; `di` and `hi` are the next elements from `iterator`; If `x` is greater than 0, it is incremented by `hi` and remains positive.

The value of `x` is decremented by `min(di, x)` and remains positive, so the output state is:
`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `_` remains equal to `n`; `n` is an input integer; `x` is decremented by `min(di, x)` and remains positive; `d` is sorted in reverse order; `h` remains an empty list; `ans` is the count of how many times the loop executed plus 2; `iterator` has more elements; `di` and `hi` are the next elements from `iterator`; If `x` is greater than 0, it is incremented by `hi` and remains positive.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `_` remains equal to `n`; `n` is an input integer; `x` is decremented by `min(di, x)` and remains positive; `d` is sorted in reverse order; `h` remains an empty list; `ans` is the count of how many times the loop executed plus 2; `iterator` has more elements; `di` and `hi` are the next elements from `iterator`; If `x` is greater than 0, it is incremented by `hi` and remains positive**.
