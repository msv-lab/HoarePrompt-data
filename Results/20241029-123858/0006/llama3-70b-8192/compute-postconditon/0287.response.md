The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: If `x` is greater than 0, `x` is increased by `hi`, otherwise `x` remains unchanged and other variables remain unaffected, variable `ans` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
