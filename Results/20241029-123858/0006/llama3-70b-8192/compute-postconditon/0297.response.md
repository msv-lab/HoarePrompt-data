`x` is decreased by the minimum value between `di` and `x`. Since `x` is greater than 0, the decrease will be within the range `[0, x]`. Therefore, the output state is: `m` and `n` are integers. If `n` < 0, `m` is increased by 1 and `n` is negated. If `n` == 0, the function returns `m`. Otherwise, `n` is decreased by 13 and `m` is increased by 1. `x` is greater than 0 and `x` is decreased by `min(di, x)`.

Output State: **`m` and `n` are integers. If `n` < 0, `m` is increased by 1 and `n` is negated. If `n` == 0, the function returns `m`. Otherwise, `n` is decreased by 13 and `m` is increased by 1. `x` is greater than 0 and `x` is decreased by `min(di, x)`.**
