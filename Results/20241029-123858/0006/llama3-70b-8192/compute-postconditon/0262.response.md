The value of `x` is decremented by the minimum value between `di` and `x`. However, the previous values of `di` and `x` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: variable `x` is decreased by the minimum value between `di` and `x`.

Output State: **variable `x` is decreased by the minimum value between `di` and `x**
