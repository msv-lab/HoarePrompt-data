`d` is assigned an empty list. The states of `_`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `x` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `_` is less than -1; `a` and `b` are integers; `n` and `x` are input integers; `d` is an empty list.

Output State: **`_` is less than -1; `a` and `b` are integers; `n` and `x` are input integers; `d` is an empty list**
