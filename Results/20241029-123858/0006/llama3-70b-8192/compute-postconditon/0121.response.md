`di` is appended to the list `d`. Since `di` is an input integer, we accept its value from input. The initial state of `d` is an empty list, so after the execution, `d` will contain the value of `di`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is an input integer; `a` and `b` are integers; `n` and `x` are input integers; `d` contains the input integer `di`; `h` is an empty list; `di` and `hi` are input integers split from input**
