Postcondition: **`_` is an input integer increased by 3, `a` and `b` are integers, `n` and `x` are input integers, `d` contains the first, second, and third input integers `di`, `di`, `di` sorted in descending order, `h` contains the first, second, and third input integers `hi`, `hi`, `hi` sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the number of iterations executed, `iterator` is an iterator of pairs from `d` and `h`, `di` and `hi` are the next values from `iterator`, and if `x` is less than or equal to 0 or the iterator is exhausted, we break out of the loop or if statement.**
