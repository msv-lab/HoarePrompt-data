`di` and `hi` are reassigned with the values obtained from the input split into two integers. The function `map(int, input().split())` takes an input, splits it into components, and converts them to integers.

Output State: **_ is an input integer increased by 1 where the input integer is less than -1, `a` and `b` are integers, `n` and `x` are input integers, `d` contains the input integer `di`, `h` contains the input integer `hi`, `di` and `hi` are input integers split from input**
