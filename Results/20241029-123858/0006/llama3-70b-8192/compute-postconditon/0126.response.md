`di` is appended to the list `d`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `_` is an input integer increased by 1 where the input integer is less than -1, `a` and `b` are integers, `n` and `x` are input integers, `d` contains the input integer `di` appended, `h` contains the input integer `hi`, `di` and `hi` are input integers split from input.
