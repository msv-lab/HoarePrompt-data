Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `_` remains equal to `n`; `n` is an input integer; `x` is greater than `di` after being decreased by `min(di, x)`; `d` is sorted in reverse order; `h` remains an empty list; `ans` is 3; `iterator` is an iterator of zipped `d` and `h`; `di` is the next element from `d`; `hi` is the next element from `h`. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `x` is greater than 0, `x` is increased by `hi`.**
