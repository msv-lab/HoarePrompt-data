The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `di` and `hi` are the next values from `iterator`, `x` is decreased by the minimum value between `di` and `x`. If `x` is greater than 0, then `x` is increased by `hi`, `ans` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
