To determine whether the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition `_ < 0` and ensure that `_` remains less than 0.

From the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `_` is `n` increased by 4, incremented by 3, and is less than 0.
- `n` is less than -6.

Given the above, `_` can be represented as follows:
\[ _ = n + 4 + 3 \]

Since `_` is already less than 0, and `n` is less than -6, let's validate this:
\[ n + 4 + 3 < 0 \]
\[ n + 7 < 0 \]
\[ n < -7 \]

Since `n` is already less than -6, the state `n < -6` needs to be adjusted to `n < -7` to ensure that `_` remains less than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted, because the other variables (`x`, `a`, `b`, `d`, `h`, `ans`, `iterator`, `di`, `hi`) do not influence the loop condition `_ < 0`.

State: **`x` is an input integer, -1 is printed if `x` is positive, otherwise `ans` is printed. `_` is `n` increased by 4, incremented by 3, and is less than 0, `a` and `b` are integers, `n` is less than -7, `x` is an input integer, `d` is a list containing `di` appended to the original `d` and the new `di`, `h` contains `hi` appended, `ans` is the number of iterations executed before `x` becomes less than or equal to 0 or the iterator is exhausted, `iterator` is exhausted or advanced by the number of pairs fetched, `di` and `hi` are input integers, `di` is an input integer, `hi` is an input integer.**
