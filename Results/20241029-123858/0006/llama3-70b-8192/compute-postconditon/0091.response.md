`x` is incremented by `hi`, but the previous value of `x` and `hi` are unknown. Therefore, the new value of `x` is the previous value of `x` plus the value of `hi`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `_` remains equal to `n`; `n` is an input integer; `x` is incremented by `hi`; `d` is sorted in reverse order; `h` remains an empty list; `ans` is the count of how many times the loop executed plus 1; `iterator` has more elements; `di` and `hi` are the next elements from `iterator`**
