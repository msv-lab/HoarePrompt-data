`n` and `x` are assigned the values obtained from `map(int, input().split())`, where `input` accepts an input and `split()` splits the input string into components, which are then converted into integers. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **variable `_` is less than -1; `a` and `b` are integers; `n` and `x` are input integers.**
