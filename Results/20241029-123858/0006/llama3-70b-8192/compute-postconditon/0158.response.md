Output State: **If `x` is greater than 0, then `x` is decreased by `min(di, x)` and increased by `hi`, all other variables remain as described in the precondition: `_` is an input integer increased by 3, `a` and `b` are integers, `n` and `x` are input integers, `d` contains the first, second, and third input integers `di`, `di`, `di` sorted in descending order, `h` contains the first, second, and third input integers `hi`, `hi`, `hi` sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 3, `iterator` is an iterator of pairs from `d` and `h`, `di` and `hi` are the next values from `iterator`, `x` is decreased by `min(di, x)` and increased by `hi`.**
