To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions and the provided state closely.

### Analysis
According to the `while` loop condition:
```python
while x > 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than 0.

### Provided State
The provided state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `_` is an input integer increased by 3,
- `a` and `b` are integers,
- `n` and `x` are input integers with `x` greater than 0,
- `d` contains the first, second, and third input integers `di`, `di`, `di` sorted in descending order,
- `h` contains the first, second, and third input integers `hi`, `hi`, `hi` sorted in ascending order,
- `ans` is increased by 1,
- `iterator` is an iterator of pairs from `d` and `h` with more elements available,
- `di`, `hi` are the next values from `iterator` assigned to `di` and `hi` respectively,
- `x` is decreased by the minimum of `di` and the original `x`,
- if `x` is greater than 0, `x` is increased by the next value from `iterator` assigned to `hi`,
- and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `x` is less than or equal to 0.

### Determining Necessary Adjustments
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `x` needs to be greater than 0. The key part here is to ensure that after all the modifications to `x` within the loop body, `x` remains greater than 0.

1. **Ensure `x` is greater than 0**: This is already specified in the provided state.
2. **Check the iterator**: The state indicates that `iterator` has more elements available. This means there are more pairs `(di, hi)` that can be fetched and used.
3. **Adjust `x` accordingly**:
   - `x` is decreased by the minimum of `di` and the original `x`. To ensure `x` remains greater than 0, we also need to consider that `x` can be increased by the next value from `iterator` assigned to `hi`.

Given this, the critical condition is that after all operations, `x` should still be greater than 0. Since the state at the end of the previous iteration already specifies that `x` is greater than 0, we don't need to make any adjustments as long as the iterator has more elements and `x` remains positive after the loop body operations.

### Final State
Thus, the state remains unchanged to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **_ is an input integer increased by 3, `a` and `b` are integers, `n` and `x` are input integers with `x` greater than 0, `d` contains the first, second, and third input integers `di`, `di`, `di` sorted in descending order, `h` contains the first, second, and third input integers `hi`, `hi`, `hi` sorted in ascending order, `ans` is increased by 1, `iterator` is an iterator of pairs from `d` and `h` with more elements available, `di`, `hi` are the next values from `iterator` assigned to `di` and `hi` respectively, `x` is decreased by the minimum of `di` and the original `x`, if `x` is greater than 0, `x` is increased by the next value from `iterator` assigned to `hi`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `x` is less than or equal to 0**
