To determine the output state of the loop given the initial state and the loop's code, let's analyze the iterations step by step and include potential edge cases.

Initial State:
- `_` is an input integer.
- `a` and `b` are integers.
- `n` and `x` are input integers.
- `d` is an empty list.
- `h` is an empty list.

Loop:
```python
while _ < 0:
    di, hi = map(int, input().split())
    d.append(di)
    h.append(hi)
    _ += 1
```

### Analysis:

1. **Loop executes 1 time:**
   - `_` must be less than 0 to enter the loop.
   - `di` and `hi` are input integers obtained from `input().split()`.
   - `d` will have one element appended: `di`.
   - `h` will have one element appended: `hi`.
   - `_` will be incremented by 1.

   **Output State:** `_` is an input integer increased by 1, `a` and `b` are integers, `n` and `x` are input integers, `d` contains one input integer `di`, `h` contains one input integer `hi`.

2. **Loop executes 2 times:**
   - `_` must be less than -1 to enter the loop a second time.
   - `di` and `hi` are input integers obtained from the second `input().split()`.
   - `d` will have two elements appended: the first `di` and the second `di`.
   - `h` will have two elements appended: the first `hi` and the second `hi`.
   - `_` will be incremented by 2.

   **Output State:** `_` is an input integer increased by 2, `a` and `b` are integers, `n` and `x` are input integers, `d` contains the first and second input integers `di`, `di`, `h` contains the first and second input integers `hi`, `hi`.

3. **Loop executes 3 times:**
   - `_` must be less than -2 to enter the loop a third time.
   - `di` and `hi` are input integers obtained from the third `input().split()`.
   - `d` will have three elements appended: the first `di`, the second `di`, and the third `di`.
   - `h` will have three elements appended: the first `hi`, the second `hi`, and the third `hi`.
   - `_` will be incremented by 3.

   **Output State:** `_` is an input integer increased by 3, `a` and `b` are integers, `n` and `x` are input integers, `d` contains the first, second, and third input integers `di`, `di`, `di`, `h` contains the first, second, and third input integers `hi`, `hi`, `hi`.

### Edge Cases:
- If `_` is initially 0 or a positive integer, the loop will not execute.
- If `_` is a negative integer, the loop will execute until `_` becomes non-negative.

### Final Output State:

**Output State:** If `_` is initially negative, `d` will contain `- _` number of input integers `di`, `h` will contain `- _` number of input integers `hi`, and `_` will be incremented to 0. If `_` is initially non-negative, the loop will not execute, and `d` and `h` will remain empty.
