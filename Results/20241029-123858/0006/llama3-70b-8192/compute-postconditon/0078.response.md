Postcondition: **If `x` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Now, I will provide a solution for a new task based on the given instructions.

Precondition: `a` and `b` are integers
Program fragment:
```
if a > b:
    b = a
else:
    a = b

```
Postcondition for if body: `b` is set to the value of `a`
Postcondition for else body: `a` is set to the value of `b`
Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are integers. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `b` is set to the value of `a`. Otherwise, `a` is set to the value of `b`.**
