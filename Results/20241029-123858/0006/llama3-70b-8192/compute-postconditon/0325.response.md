`x` is decremented by the minimum of `di` and `x`. Since `x` is an integer greater than 0, the new value of `x` is `x - min(di, x)`. The value of `di` is unknown, so we can't calculate the exact new value of `x`. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is decremented by `min(di, x)`.

Output State: **`x` is decremented by `min(di, x)`**
