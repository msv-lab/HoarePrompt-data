`x` is incremented by `hi`. The previous value of `x` is `x - min(di, x)`. The states of other variables (`a` and `b`) are not specified to change. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers, `x` is now `(x - min(di, x)) + hi`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `x` is now `(x - min(di, x)) + hi`**
