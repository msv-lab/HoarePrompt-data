Output State: **If `_` (which is `n` increased by 4) is less than 0 initially, `d` and `h` contain pairs of `di` and `hi` collected from input until `_` becomes 0 or greater, incrementing `_` by 1 each iteration. If `_` is not less than 0 initially, `d` and `h` remain empty, `_` remains `n` increased by 4, `ans` is 0, `iterator` is an iterator over pairs of `d` and `h`, `di` and `hi` are the next input integers from the iterator, `d` is sorted in descending order, `h` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 0, `x` is decreased by the minimum of `di` and `x`.**
