`x` is decreased by the minimum value between `di` and `x`. The values of `di` and `x` are not provided, so the exact new value of `x` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x` is decreased by the minimum value between `di` and `x`.

Output State: **`di` and `hi` are the next values from `iterator`, `x` is decreased by the minimum value between `di` and `x`**
