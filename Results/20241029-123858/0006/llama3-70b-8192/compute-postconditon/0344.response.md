To determine the output state of the provided code, we will analyze the loop's behavior and the final states of the variables involved. 

### Analysis

1. **Outer `while` loop condition:**
   - The loop runs while `_ < 0`. Given the initial state `t` is between 1 and 100, `_` starts as a positive integer. Therefore, the outer loop will not execute even once because `_` is never less than 0.

2. **Inner operations:**
   - Since the outer loop does not run, no inner operations (such as input reading, list manipulation, or calculations) are performed.

3. **Edge Case:**
   - The edge case where `_` starts as a positive integer which is always the case here (1 <= t <= 100), means the loop will never execute regardless of the values involved.

### Conclusion

Given that the outer loop does not execute, the state of the variables remains unchanged from their initial values.

### Output State

Output State: **`_` is assigned the value of `t`, where `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. No changes occur to any other variables as the loop does not execute.**
