The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the loop or if statement.

Output State: **If `x` is greater than 0, `x` is decreased by the smaller value between `di` and `x`, and then `x` is increased by the value of `hi`, `ans` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
