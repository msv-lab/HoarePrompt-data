Output State: **If `x` is positive, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is printed. `_` is an input integer increased by 4 and is less than 0, `a` and `b` are integers, `n` and `x` are input integers, `d` contains the first, second, and third input integers `di`, `di`, `di` sorted in descending order, `h` contains the first, second, and third input integers `hi`, `hi`, `hi` sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the number of iterations executed before `x` becomes less than or equal to 0 or the iterator is exhausted, `iterator` is exhausted or advanced by the number of pairs fetched, `di` and `hi` are the next values from `iterator`, if available, `x` is less than or equal to 0, or the iterator has been exhausted. If `x` is 0 or negative initially, `ans` remains 0 and `iterator` is exhausted. If the iterator is exhausted before `x` becomes less than or equal to 0, `x` remains positive, `n` and `x` are the next input integers.**
