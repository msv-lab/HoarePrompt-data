`di` and `hi` are assigned the values of the split input integers. Therefore, the output state is `_` is an input integer increased by 2 where the input integer is less than -2, `a` and `b` are integers, `n` and `x` are input integers, `d` contains the input integer `di` appended, `h` contains the input integers `hi` and `hi` appended, `di` and `hi` are input integers split from input.
