RESULT: **Incorrect**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle the case where Zmei Gorynich cannot be defeated. Specifically, it fails to account for scenarios where no combination of blows can ever reduce the number of heads to zero, resulting in an infinite loop of head regrowth. The example provided in the prompt where the output should be `-1` (i.e., when it's impossible to defeat Zmei) is not correctly handled by the code.
