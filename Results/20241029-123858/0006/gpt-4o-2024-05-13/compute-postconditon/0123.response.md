The function returns the value of `results`. Based on the initial state, `results` contains either 1, -1, or a calculated value for each query processed. Therefore, the output state is `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, and the function returns `results`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, and the function returns `results`**
