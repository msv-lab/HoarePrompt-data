Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`, `results` is its previous values plus 1 if any `d` from the tuples in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `iterator` is an iterator over the list `blows`, `max_single_blow` is updated to the maximum value between `max_single_blow` and `d`, `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum value between `max_effective_blow` and `d - h` if `d` is greater than `h`, `query` is the next element from `iterator`, `n` is the first element of the tuple `query[0]`, `x` is the second element of the tuple `query[0]`, `blows` is assigned the value `query[1:]`, `d` and `h` are assigned the first and second elements of the next tuple from the iterator over `blows` respectively. If `d` is greater than or equal to `x`, `results` is updated with an additional 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, If the iterator has no more items, a `StopIteration` exception is raised, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, If `d` is greater than `h`, `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum value between `max_effective_blow` and `d - h`, `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum between its current value and `d - h` if `d` is greater than `h`.**
