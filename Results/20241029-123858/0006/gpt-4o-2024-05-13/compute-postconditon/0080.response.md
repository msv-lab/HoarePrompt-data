In the provided program, the `try` statement contains nested `try` blocks, and the outer `try` is handling an iterator over the list `blows`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's state after executing the `try` statement, including the `except` blocks:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
   - `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`.
   - `results` is a list that will store the results for each query.

2. **Outer `try` Block:**
   - `query = next(iterator)` fetches the next query from the iterator. If the iterator has no more elements, a `StopIteration` exception will be raised, causing the `except` block to execute and break out of the loop.
   - `n` and `x` are unpacked from `query[0]`.
   - `blows = query[1:]` sets `blows` to the remaining elements of the query.
   - `max_single_blow` is initialized to 0.
   - `max_effective_blow` is initialized to negative infinity.
   - `iterator = iter(blows)` creates an iterator over the list `blows`.

3. **Inner `try` Block:**
   - The loop `while True` begins to iterate over `blows` using the iterator.
   - `d, h = next(iterator)` fetches the next pair from the iterator. If the iterator has no more elements, a `StopIteration` exception will be raised, causing the `except` block to execute and break out of the loop.
   - If `d >= x`, `results.append(1)` is executed, and the loop breaks.
   - `max_single_blow` is updated to the maximum value between `max_single_blow` and `d`.
   - If `d > h`, `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum value between `max_effective_blow` and `d - h`.

4. **Outer Loop (Else Block):**
   - If no `d` in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, the loop completes without breaking, and the else block executes.
   - If `max_effective_blow <= 0`, `results.append(-1)` is executed.
   - Otherwise, the number of additional blows needed is calculated based on `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow`, and `results.append(additional_blows + 1)` is executed.

### Exception Handling:

- **Inner `except` Block:**
  - If a `StopIteration` exception is raised inside the inner `try` block, the loop breaks.

- **Outer `except` Block:**
  - If a `StopIteration` exception is raised while fetching the next query (`query = next(iterator)`), the outer loop breaks.

### Final Program State:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`.
- `results` contains either 1 if any `d` from the tuples in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, or -1 if `max_effective_blow` is less than or equal to 0, or a calculated value based on `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow` if `d >= x` is not satisfied and `max_effective_blow` is greater than 0.
- `iterator` is an iterator over the list `blows`.
- `max_single_blow` is updated to the maximum value between `max_single_blow` and `d`.
- `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum value between `max_effective_blow` and `d - h` if `d` is greater than `h`.
- `query` is the next element from `iterator`.
- `n` is the first element of the tuple `query[0]`.
- `x` is the second element of the tuple `query[0]`.
- `blows` is assigned the value `query[1:]`.
- `d` and `h` are the first and second elements of the next tuple from the iterator over `blows`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`. `results` contains either 1 if any `d` from the tuples in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, or -1 if `max_effective_blow` is less than or equal to 0, or a calculated value based on `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow` if `d >= x` is not satisfied and `max_effective_blow` is greater than 0.**
