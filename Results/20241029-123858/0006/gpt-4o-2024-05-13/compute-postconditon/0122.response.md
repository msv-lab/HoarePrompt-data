Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`, where `n`, `d_i`, `h_i` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `d_i`, `h_i` <= 10^9, and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^9. `results` is a list that contains either 1 if any `d` from the tuples in the list `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, or -1 if `max_effective_blow` is less than or equal to 0, or a calculated value based on `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow` if `d >= x` is not satisfied and `max_effective_blow` is greater than 0. `iterator` is an iterator over the list `queries`, and will be exhausted after processing all queries. `max_single_blow` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `d` for each `d` in `blows`. `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `d - h` if `d > h` for each `(d, h)` in `blows`. If `d >= x` for any `(d, h)` in `blows`, the inner loop breaks and appends 1 to `results`. If the inner loop completes without finding `d >= x`, it checks if `max_effective_blow <= 0` and appends -1 to `results`; otherwise, it calculates the necessary additional blows to reach `x` and appends this calculated value + 1 to `results`. If `StopIteration` is raised during `query = next(iterator)`, the outer loop breaks. Edge cases include when `queries` is empty, in which case `results` remains an empty list, and when all `d` values in `blows` are less than `x` and `max_effective_blow` is non-positive, leading to `-1` being appended to `results`.**
