The `StopIteration` exception might be triggered at `result = next(iterator)` if there are no more items in the `iterator`. If this exception is raised, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to print the next result from the `iterator`.

Therefore:
Output State: **`t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is a list of tuples containing `(n, x)` and the list of `blows`, `results` is assigned the return value of `func(t, queries)`, `index` is incremented appropriately based on the loop, `_` is either 0 or greater, or incremented to 0 based on the initial state, `iterator` is an iterator over `results`. If there are more items in the `iterator`, `result` is the next value and it is printed. If `iterator` is exhausted, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
