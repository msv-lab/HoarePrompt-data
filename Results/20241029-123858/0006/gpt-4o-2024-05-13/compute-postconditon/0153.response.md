Output State: **If `_` is initially 0 or greater, `t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is `[((n, x), blows)]`, `results` is a list, `index` is 3, `n` is `int(data[1])`, `x` is `int(data[2])`, `blows` is an empty list, `_` is incremented by 1. If `_` is initially negative (`-_` is k), `t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is `[((n, x), blows)]`, `results` is a list, `index` is 3 + 2k, `n` is `int(data[1])`, `x` is `int(data[2])`, `blows` contains k tuples of `(d, h)` from `data`, `_` is incremented to 0**.
