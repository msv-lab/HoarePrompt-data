A `StopIteration` exception is raised when the `next(iterator)` call is made but the iterator is exhausted. When this exception is raised, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If no exception is raised, the function proceeds to print the `result` which is the next value from the `iterator`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is a list of tuples containing `(n, x)` and the list of `blows`, `results` is assigned the return value of `func(t, queries)`, `index` is incremented appropriately based on the loop, `_` is either 0 or greater, or incremented to 0 based on the initial state, `iterator` is an iterator over `results`, `result` is the next value from `iterator`, and `result` is printed. If the iterator is exhausted, a `StopIteration` exception is raised and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
