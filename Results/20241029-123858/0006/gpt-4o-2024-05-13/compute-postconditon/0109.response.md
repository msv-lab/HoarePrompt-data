Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`, `results` contains either 1 if any `d` from the tuples in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, or -1 if `max_effective_blow` is less than or equal to 0, or a calculated value based on `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow` if `d >= x` is not satisfied and `max_effective_blow` is greater than 0, `max_single_blow` is updated to `max(max_single_blow, d)`, if `d > h`, `max_effective_blow` is updated to `max(max_effective_blow, d - h)`, `d` and `h` are the next values from the iterator or the loop breaks if `StopIteration` is raised, `results` is appended with the value 1**.
