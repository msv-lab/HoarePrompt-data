The `StopIteration` exception occurs when the `next(iterator)` function call attempts to retrieve the next item from the iterator but the iterator is exhausted. If `StopIteration` is raised, the loop breaks.

To summarize the program's state after the complete execution of the `try` statement, we need to consider both the normal execution path and the exception handling path.

1. **Normal Execution Path:**
    - The variables `d` and `h` are assigned the next tuple from the iterator.
    - If `d` is greater than or equal to `x`, `1` is appended to `results`, and the loop breaks.
    - `max_single_blow` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_single_blow` and `d`.
    - If `d` is greater than `h`, `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_effective_blow` and `d - h`.

2. **Exception Handling Path:**
    - If the `next(iterator)` raises a `StopIteration` exception, the loop breaks.

Combining these observations, the output state after the complete execution of the `try` statement is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`. `results` contains either 1 if any `d` from the tuples in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, or -1 if `max_effective_blow` is less than or equal to 0, or a calculated value based on `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow` if `d >= x` is not satisfied and `max_effective_blow` is greater than 0. `max_single_blow` is updated to the maximum value between `max_single_blow` and `d`. If `d` is greater than `h`, `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum value between `max_effective_blow` and `d - h`. If the iterator is exhausted (raising `StopIteration`), the loop breaks.**
