`_` is assigned the value of `t`, which does not affect the state of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is an empty list, `results` is a list, `index` is 1.
Output State: **`t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is an empty list, `results` is a list, `index` is 1**
