`_` is assigned the value of `n`, but `_` is a throwaway variable often used to indicate that the value is intentionally being ignored. Therefore, none of the other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is an empty list, `results` is a list, `index` is 3, `n` is `int(data[1])`, `x` is `int(data[2])`, `blows` is an empty list**
