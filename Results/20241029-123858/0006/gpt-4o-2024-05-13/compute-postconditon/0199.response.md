`_` is incremented by 1. The previous values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **If `_` is initially greater than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute, and the state remains unchanged. If `_` is initially less than 0, the loop executes until `_` becomes 0. In this case: `_` will be `0`, `index` will be incremented by `2 * abs(int(data[5]))`, `blows` will contain `abs(int(data[5]))` pairs of `(d, h)`, and other variables (`t`, `queries`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `int(data[3])`) will remain unchanged. `queries` is appended with a tuple containing another tuple `(n, x)` and the list `blows`.**
