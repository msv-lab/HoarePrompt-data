`d` is assigned the value `int(data[index])` and `index` is 3, so `d` is `int(data[3])`.  
`h` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])` and `index` is 3, so `h` is `int(data[4])`.  
The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 

Output State: **`t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is an empty list, `results` is a list, `index` is 3, `n` is `int(data[1])`, `x` is `int(data[2])`, `blows` is an empty list, `d` is `int(data[3])`, `h` is `int(data[4])`**
