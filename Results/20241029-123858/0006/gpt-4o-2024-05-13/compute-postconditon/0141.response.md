`d` and `h` are assigned the values of `int(data[index])` and `int(data[index + 1])` respectively. The value of `index` is 5, so `d` is assigned the value of `int(data[5])` and `h` is assigned the value of `int(data[6])`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is an empty list, `results` is a list, `index` is 5, `n` is `int(data[1])`, `x` is `int(data[2])`, `blows` is a list containing a tuple with the values `(d, h)`, `d` is `int(data[5])`, `h` is `int(data[6])`, variable `_` is less than 0**
