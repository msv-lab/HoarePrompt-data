To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to examine the condition in the `while` loop statement and the current state provided.

The `while` loop condition is `_ < 0`. For the loop to execute, the variable `_` must be less than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`
- `queries` is an empty list
- `results` is a list
- `index` is 5
- `n` is `int(data[1])`
- `x` is `int(data[2])`
- `blows` is a list containing a tuple with the values `(d, h)`
- `d` is `int(data[3])`
- `h` is `int(data[4])`
- variable `_` is increased by 1

Since the loop condition is `_ < 0`, we need to ensure `_` is still less than 0 after the previous iteration.

Given that `_` was increased by 1 in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `_` must have been less than -1 before the increment. Therefore, we need to ensure `_` is less than 0 after the increment.

State: **`t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is an empty list, `results` is a list, `index` is 5, `n` is `int(data[1])`, `x` is `int(data[2])`, `blows` is a list containing a tuple with the values `(d, h)`, `d` is `int(data[3])`, `h` is `int(data[4])`, variable `_` is less than 0**
