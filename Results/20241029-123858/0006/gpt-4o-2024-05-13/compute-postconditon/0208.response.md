Given a `while True` loop, the loop is designed to run indefinitely unless an internal condition causes it to break out of the loop. Since the provided loop statement is `while True`, it inherently means that without knowing the exact internal conditions, the loop is expected to iterate again. Therefore, the program state should be repeated as it was at the end of the previous iteration, assuming no break condition is explicitly mentioned within the provided context.

State: **`t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is a list of tuples containing `(n, x)` and the list of `blows`, `results` is assigned the return value of `func(t, queries)`, `index` is incremented appropriately based on the loop, `_` is either 0 or greater, or incremented to 0 based on the initial state, `iterator` is an iterator over `results`. If there are more items in the `iterator`, `result` is the next value and it is printed. If `iterator` is exhausted, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
