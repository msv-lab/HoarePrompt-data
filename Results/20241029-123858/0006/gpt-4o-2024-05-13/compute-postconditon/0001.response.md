iterator is assigned the value iter(queries), which is an iterator over the list queries. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, queries is a list of t tuples, each containing a tuple (n, x) and a list of n tuples (d_i, h_i), where n, d_i, h_i are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= d_i, h_i <= 10^9, and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9, results is an empty list, iterator is an iterator over the list queries.
