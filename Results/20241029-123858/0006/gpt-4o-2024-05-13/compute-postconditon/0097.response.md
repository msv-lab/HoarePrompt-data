Since the `while` loop in the provided task is an infinite `while True` loop, it will always proceed to the next iteration unless explicitly broken by a `break` statement. Therefore, we do not need to adjust any specific conditions for the loop to execute one more time. 

The state at the end of the previous iteration can simply be repeated. 

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`, `results` contains either 1 if any `d` from the tuples in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, or -1 if `max_effective_blow` is less than or equal to 0, or a calculated value based on `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow` if `d >= x` is not satisfied and `max_effective_blow` is greater than 0. If `d` is greater than or equal to `x`, `results` is appended with 1 and the loop breaks. `max_single_blow` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `d`. If `d` is greater than `h`, `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `d - h`. If the iterator is exhausted (raising `StopIteration`), the loop breaks.**
