Initial State: `t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is a list of tuples containing `(n, x)` and the list of `blows`, `results` is a list, `index` is incremented appropriately based on the loop, and `_` is either 0 or greater, or incremented to 0 based on the initial state.

```
results = func(t, queries)
```

Output State: **`t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is a list of tuples containing `(n, x)` and the list of `blows`, `results` is assigned the return value of `func(t, queries)`, `index` is incremented appropriately based on the loop, and `_` is either 0 or greater, or incremented to 0 based on the initial state.**
