Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`, where `n`, `d_i`, `h_i` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `d_i`, `h_i` <= 10^9, and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `iterator` is an iterator over the list `queries`, `query` is the next tuple from `iterator`, `n` is the first element of `query[0]`, `x` is the second element of `query[0]`, `blows` is the list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)` from `query`, `max_single_blow` is the maximum of 0 and `d`, `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `d - h` if `d` is greater than `h`, `iterator` is an iterator over the list `blows`, `d` is the first element of the next tuple from `iterator`, `h` is the second element of the next tuple from `iterator`.**
