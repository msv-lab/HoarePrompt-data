`result` is assigned the next value from `iterator`. If there are more items in `iterator`, `result` is the next value. If `iterator` is exhausted, it raises `StopIteration` and the program would break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is a list of tuples containing `(n, x)` and the list of `blows`, `results` is assigned the return value of `func(t, queries)`, `index` is incremented appropriately based on the loop, `_` is either 0 or greater, or incremented to 0 based on the initial state, `iterator` is an iterator over `results`, `result` is the next value from `iterator` or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `iterator` is exhausted.**
