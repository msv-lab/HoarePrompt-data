t` is assigned the integer value of the first element of `data`, where `data` is a list of strings obtained from input. The variable `queries` and `results` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, `results` is a list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, `results` is a list**
