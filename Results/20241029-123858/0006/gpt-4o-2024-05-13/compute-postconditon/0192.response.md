`d` and `h` are assigned the values of `int(data[index])` and `int(data[index + 1])`, where `index` is 11. 

Initial State: `_` is `int(data[5]) + 2`, `t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is `[((n, x), blows), ((n, x), blows)]`, `results` is a list, `index` is 11, `n` is `int(data[5])`, `x` is `int(data[6])`, `blows` is `[(int(data[7]), int(data[8])), (int(data[9]), int(data[10]))]`, `int(data[3])` is less than -1, `d` is `int(data[9])`, `h` is `int(data[10])`, `int(data[5])` is less than -2

After execution, `d` is assigned `int(data[11])` and `h` is assigned `int(data[12])`.

Output State: **`_` is `int(data[5]) + 2`, `t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is `[((n, x), blows), ((n, x), blows)]`, `results` is a list, `index` is 11, `n` is `int(data[5])`, `x` is `int(data[6])`, `blows` is `[(int(data[7]), int(data[8])), (int(data[9]), int(data[10]))]`, `int(data[3])` is less than -1, `d` is `int(data[11])`, `h` is `int(data[12])`, `int(data[5])` is less than -2**
