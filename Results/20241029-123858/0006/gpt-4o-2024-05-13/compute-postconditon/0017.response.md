Given the provided `while True` loop and the program state at the end of the previous iteration, the loop is designed to execute indefinitely. Therefore, the program state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. We just need to repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`, where `n`, `d_i`, `h_i` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `d_i`, `h_i` <= 10^9, and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^9. `results` is a list that may contain 1 if `d >= x` is satisfied for any tuple, `iterator` is an iterator over the list `queries`, `query` is the next tuple from `iterator`, `n` is the first element of `query[0]`, `x` is the second element of `query[0]`, `blows` is the list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)` from `query`, `max_single_blow` is the maximum of 0 and `d`, `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `d - h` if `d` is greater than `h`, `iterator` is an iterator over the list `blows`. If `StopIteration` is raised, the program breaks out of the loop.**
