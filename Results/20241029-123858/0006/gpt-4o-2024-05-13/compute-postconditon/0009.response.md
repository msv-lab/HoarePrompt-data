The value `1` is appended to the list `results`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`, where `n`, `d_i`, `h_i` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `d_i`, `h_i` <= 10^9, and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing 1, `iterator` is an iterator over the list `queries`, `query` is the next tuple from `iterator`, `n` is the first element of `query[0]`, `x` is the second element of `query[0]`, `blows` is the list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)` from `query`, `max_single_blow` is 0, `max_effective_blow` is float('-inf'), `iterator` is an iterator over the list `blows`, `d` is the first element of the next tuple from `iterator`, `h` is the second element of the next tuple from `iterator`.
