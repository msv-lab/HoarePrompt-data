Given that the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute as long as it is not externally terminated or broken from within the loop body. 

Since the loop can certainly execute one more time, there is no need to modify the program state. We simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`. `results` contains either 1 if any `d` from the tuples in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, or -1 if `max_effective_blow` is less than or equal to 0, or a calculated value based on `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow` if `d >= x` is not satisfied and `max_effective_blow` is greater than 0.**
