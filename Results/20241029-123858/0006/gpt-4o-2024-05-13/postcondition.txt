`t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is a list of tuples containing `(n, x)` and the list of `blows`, `results` is assigned the return value of `func(t, queries)`, `index` is incremented appropriately based on the loop, `_` is either 0 or greater, or incremented to 0 based on the initial state, `iterator` is an iterator over `results`. If the iterator has more items, `result` is the next value from `iterator`, and `result` is printed. If the iterator is exhausted, a `StopIteration` exception is raised, causing the loop to break, and no further results are printed. If `results` is empty from the start, the loop will not print anything and will break immediately.
