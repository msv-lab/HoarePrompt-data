Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program attempts to find all pairs of \( n \) and \( m \) such that there are exactly \( x \) distinct squares in an \( n \times m \) table. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Square Counting Logic**: The logic used to count the squares is incorrect. The calculation `total_squares += (n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)` does not correctly compute the number of squares in an \( n \times m \) table. The number of squares of size \( k \times k \) in an \( n \times m \) table is given by \( (n - k + 1) \times (m - k + 1) \). The correct total number of distinct squares is the sum of these values for all possible \( k \) values.

2. **Loop Conditions**: The nested loop structure and the conditions for breaking out of the loops are not correct. The outer loop iterates over possible \( n \) values, but the inner loop incorrectly tries to find \( m \) by incrementing and checking if the total number of squares matches \( x \).

Example Case:
Consider \( x = 26 \).
- The program might incorrectly compute the number of squares and fail to find the pairs \( (n, m) \) that satisfy the condition.

To illustrate, let's manually calculate the distinct squares for an \( n = 3 \) and \( m = 5 \) table:
- \( 1 \times 1 \) squares: \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
- \( 2 \times 2 \) squares: \( (3 - 2 + 1) \times (5 - 2 + 1) = 2 \times 4 = 8 \)
- \( 3 \times 3 \) squares: \( (3 - 3 + 1) \times (5 - 3 + 1) = 1 \times 3 = 3 \)
- Total: \( 15 + 8 + 3 = 26 \)

The program's logic does not correctly calculate these values, leading to incorrect results.

Conclusion: The program does not correctly handle the problem as described for every potential case, making it incorrect.
