m is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: If total_squares reaches x, results will contain the tuple (n, m) and the loop will terminate. If total_squares exceeds x without equaling x, the loop will terminate without modifying results. After the loop, m is incremented to a value where total_squares exceeds x. If x is sufficiently large and no suitable (n, m) pair exists, the loop will continue until total_squares > x; n is incremented by 1, and n is less than int(x, `m` is 0.
