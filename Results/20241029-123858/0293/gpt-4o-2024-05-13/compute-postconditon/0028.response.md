The value of `total_squares` is incremented by the product of `(n - m + 1)` and `(m - n + 1)`. This means `total_squares` is increased by the value of `(n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)`, but without specific values for `n`, `m`, and `total_squares`, the exact numerical outcome cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: `total_squares` is incremented by `(n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)`.

Output State: **If total_squares reaches x, results will contain the tuple (n, m) and the loop will terminate. If total_squares exceeds x without equaling x, the loop will terminate without modifying results. After the loop, m is incremented to a value where total_squares exceeds x. If x is sufficiently large and no suitable (n, m) pair exists, the loop will continue until total_squares > x; n is incremented by 1, and n is less than x, `m` is 1, total_squares is incremented by `(n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)`.**
