`total_squares` is assigned the value `total_squares + (n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)`. Given the initial state:
- `n` has increased by 1
- `m` is 1
- `total_squares` is 0

So after evaluating the expression:
- `n - m + 1` results in `(n - 1 + 1)`, which simplifies to `n`
- `m - n + 1` results in `(1 - n + 1)`, which simplifies to `2 - n`

Thus:
- `total_squares += n * (2 - n)`

Evaluating the expression further:
- `total_squares = 0 + n * (2 - n)`, resulting in `total_squares = n * (2 - n)`

Given `n` has increased by 1, the final value of `total_squares` is `n * (2 - n)`.

Output State: **`n` has increased by 1, `m` is 1, `total_squares` is `n * (2 - n)`, `results` will remain unmodified, and `x` is adjusted such that `n < int(x`**
