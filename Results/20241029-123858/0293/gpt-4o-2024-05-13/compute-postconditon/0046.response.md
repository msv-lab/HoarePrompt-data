Output State: **If `total_squares` reaches `x`, the tuple `(n, m)` is appended to `results`, and the loop terminates. If `total_squares` exceeds `x` without equaling `x`, the loop terminates without modifying `results`. After the loop, `m` is incremented to a value where `total_squares` exceeds `x`. If `x` is sufficiently large and no suitable `(n, m)` pair exists, the loop will continue until `total_squares` exceeds `x`. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not start, and all variables will remain unchanged: `n` has increased by 1; `m` will have its initial value, `total_squares` will be 0, and `results` will remain unmodified.**
