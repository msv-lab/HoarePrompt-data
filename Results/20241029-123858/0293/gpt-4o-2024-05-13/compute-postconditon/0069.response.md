`n` is incremented by 1. Based on the initial state, other variables (`m`, `total_squares`, `x`, `results`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `total_squares` is less than `x`, `m` is 1 after the first iteration, `total_squares` is `n * (2 - n)`, `x` is adjusted such that `n < int(x)`, `results` is unchanged, and `n` is incremented by 1.
