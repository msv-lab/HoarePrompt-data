Precondition: `n` has increased by 1, `m` is 1, `total_squares` is `n * (2 - n)`, `results` will remain unmodified, and `x` is adjusted such that `n < int(x`

Program fragment:
```
if total_squares == x:
    results.append((n, m))
    break
```

Postcondition for if body: `n` has increased by 1, `m` is 1, `total_squares` is `n * (2 - n)`, `results` has a tuple `(n, m)` appended, and `x` is adjusted such that `n < int(x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Postcondition for else body: there is no else part in the code
Postcondition: **`n` has increased by 1, `m` is 1, `total_squares` is `n * (2 - n)`, `x` is adjusted such that `n < int(x`. If `total_squares` is equal to `x`, `results` has a tuple `(n, m)` appended and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `total_squares` is not equal to `x`, the program continues without modifying `results`. Include edge cases where `total_squares` might be just below or above `x` to ensure all logical boundaries are covered.**
