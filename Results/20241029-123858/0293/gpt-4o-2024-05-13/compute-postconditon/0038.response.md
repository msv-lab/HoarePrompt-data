To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to verify the condition `total_squares < x` based on the information provided.

The given state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `total_squares` is less than `x` and is increased by `(n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)`
- `n` is less than `x`
- `m` is increased by 1

Given this information, let's analyze if the current state allows the `while` loop to execute again:

1. **Condition Check**: The loop condition is `total_squares < x`. For the loop to execute, `total_squares` must be less than `x`.

2. **State Update**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `total_squares` has been increased by `(n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)`.
   - `n` is still less than `x`.
   - `m` has been increased by 1.

Let's verify step by step:

- If `total_squares` is less than `x`, it means the loop condition is still satisfied.
- `n` being less than `x` indicates that `n` is still within the bounds required for the loop.
- `m` being increased by 1 does not directly impact the loop condition; it only affects the computation of `total_squares`.

Since `total_squares` is still less than `x` and the other variables do not affect the loop condition directly, the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, we can repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`total_squares` is less than `x` and is increased by `(n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)`, `n` is less than `x`, and `m` is increased by 1**
