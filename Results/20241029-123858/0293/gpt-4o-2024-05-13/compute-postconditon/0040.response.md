`total_squares` is updated by adding `(n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)`, where the values of `n` and `m` are used directly in the calculation. Since `total_squares` is already increased by `(n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)` and `m` is increased by 2, we need to incorporate these changes into the output state.

Output State: **`total_squares` is less than `x` and is increased by 2 * (n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1), `n` is less than `x`, and `m` is increased by 2**
