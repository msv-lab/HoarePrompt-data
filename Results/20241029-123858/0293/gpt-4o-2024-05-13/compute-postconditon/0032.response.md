To determine whether the loop can execute again, we need to check the condition `total_squares < x`. For the loop to execute one more time, the `total_squares` must remain less than `x`. 

Let's analyze the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:
- If `total_squares` is equal to `x`, the loop terminates.
- If `total_squares` exceeds `x`, the loop terminates.
- After the loop, `m` is incremented to a value where `total_squares` exceeds `x`.
- `n` is incremented by 1, and if `n` is less than `x`, `m` is set to 1, `total_squares` is incremented by `(n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)`, `results` is appended with the tuple `(n, m)`, and the loop breaks.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `total_squares` is less than `x` and `n` is less than `x`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `total_squares` was incremented by `(n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)`
- `results` was appended with the tuple `(n, m)`
- `m` was possibly incremented to a value where `total_squares` exceeds `x`
- `n` was incremented by 1
- `m` was reset to 1

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to confirm:
1. `total_squares` remains less than `x`
2. `n` (incremented by 1 in the loop) is still less than `x`

Given this, we can repeat the state at the end of the previous iteration, as it provides the needed conditions for the loop to execute again.

State: **`total_squares` is less than `x`, `n` is less than `x`**
