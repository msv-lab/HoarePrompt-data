`total_squares` is updated by adding the result of `(n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)`. Given `n` is 1 and `m` is 1:

```
(n - m + 1) = (1 - 1 + 1) = 1
(m - n + 1) = (1 - 1 + 1) = 1
```

So,

```
(n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1) = 1 * 1 = 1
```

Therefore, `total_squares` is updated to `total_squares + 1`, which is `0 + 1 = 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `total_squares` is 1**
