Precondition: `total_squares` is less than `x` and is increased by `(n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)`, `n` is less than `x`, and `m` is increased by 1.

Program fragment:
```
if total_squares == x:
    results.append((n, m))
    break
```

Postcondition for if body: If `total_squares` equals `x`, `results` has the tuple `(n, m)` appended, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. `total_squares` is less than `x` and is increased by `(n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)`, `n` is less than `x`, `m` is increased by 1.

Postcondition for else body: There is no else part in the code.

Postcondition: **If `total_squares` equals `x`, `results` has the tuple `(n, m)` appended, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. `total_squares` is less than `x` and is increased by `(n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)`, `n` is less than `x`, and `m` is increased by 1.**
