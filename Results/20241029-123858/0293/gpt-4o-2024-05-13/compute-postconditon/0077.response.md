A `StopIteration` might be triggered at `n, m = next(iterator)`. This happens when the `iterator` has no more items to return. 

If the `StopIteration` exception is raised, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to fetch the next values from `iterator` and print them.

Therefore: 

Output State: **If `total_squares` reaches `x` during any iteration, the tuple `(n, m)` is appended to `results`, and the inner loop terminates. If `total_squares` exceeds `x` without equaling `x`, the inner loop terminates without modifying `results`. After the inner and outer loops, `n` is incremented to a value where `n` is less than `int(x`, and then `len(results)` is printed; `iterator` is an iterator over the sorted `results`. If `iterator` has more items, `n` and `m` are the next values from `iterator`, and `n` and `m` are printed. If `iterator` is exhausted, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
