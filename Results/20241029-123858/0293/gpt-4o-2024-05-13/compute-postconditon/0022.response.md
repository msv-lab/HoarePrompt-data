Given the initial state and the loop code, let's carefully analyze the loop execution and its impact on the variables. We will consider different scenarios and potential edge cases as well.

### Loop Execution:

#### Loop executes 1 time:
Initial State: `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `m` is 0, `total_squares` is 0
```python
m += 1
total_squares += (n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)

if total_squares == x:
    results.append((n, m))
    break
```
Output State: `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `total_squares` is 1. If `total_squares` equals `x`, then `results` will contain the tuple `(1, 1)` and the execution will break out of the loop.

#### Loop executes 2 times:
Initial State: `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `total_squares` is 1
```python
m += 1
total_squares += (n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)

if total_squares == x:
    results.append((n, m))
    break
```
Output State: `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `m` is 2, `total_squares` is 2. If `total_squares` equals `x`, then `results` will contain the tuple `(1, 2)` and the execution will break out of the loop.

#### Loop executes 3 times:
Initial State: `x` is greater than 2, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `m` is 2, `total_squares` is 2
```python
m += 1
total_squares += (n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)

if total_squares == x:
    results.append((n, m))
    break
```
Output State: `x` is greater than 2, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `m` is 3, `total_squares` is -1. If `total_squares` equals `x`, then `results` will contain the tuple `(1, 3)` and the execution will break out of the loop.

### General Analysis:
Now, let's determine the output state for the general case and identify any potential edge cases missed by the loop.

- **General Execution**:
  - For each iteration, `m` is incremented by 1.
  - `total_squares` is updated by adding `(n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)`.

- **Termination Conditions**:
  - The loop terminates if `total_squares` equals `x` or if `total_squares` exceeds `x`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  1. If `x = 1`, the loop will execute exactly once, and `results` will contain `(1, 1)`.
  2. If `x` is a number such that `total_squares` never equals `x`, the loop will continue until `total_squares` exceeds `x`. For example, if `x` is very large and no suitable `(n, m)` pair satisfies the condition, the loop runs until `total_squares` surpasses `x`.

- **Non-Execution Case**:
  - Since `x` is always between 1 and 10^18, the loop will always start at least once because `total_squares` initially is 0.

### Final Output State:
```plaintext
Output State: **If total_squares reaches x, results will contain the tuple (n, m) and the loop will terminate. If total_squares exceeds x without equaling x, the loop will terminate without modifying results. After the loop, m is incremented to a value where total_squares exceeds x. If x is sufficiently large and no suitable (n, m) pair exists, the loop will continue until total_squares > x.**
