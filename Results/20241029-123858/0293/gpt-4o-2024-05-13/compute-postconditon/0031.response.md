Postcondition: **If `total_squares` is equal to `x`, the tuple `(n, m)` is appended to `results`, and the loop terminates. If `total_squares` exceeds `x` without being equal to `x`, the loop terminates without modifying `results`. After the loop, `m` is incremented to a value where `total_squares` exceeds `x`. If `x` is sufficiently large and no suitable `(n, m)` pair exists, the loop will continue until `total_squares` exceeds `x`; `n` is incremented by 1, and `n` is less than `x`, `m` is 1, `total_squares` is incremented by `(n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)`, `results` is appended with the tuple `(n, m)`, and the loop breaks.**
