To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the loop condition `total_squares < x` holds true. Let's analyze the state variables.

### State Analysis

1. **`total_squares`**: This variable is calculated as `n * (2 - n)`.
2. **`n`**: This variable has increased by 1 in the previous iteration, so we need to know its current value.
3. **`x`**: This variable affects the loop condition. The state mentions that `x` is adjusted such that `n < int(x)`.
4. **`m`**: This variable is not directly involved in the loop condition but is part of the state and may affect `results`.
5. **`results`**: This is modified if `total_squares` is equal to `x`.

### Loop Condition

The loop will execute as long as `total_squares < x`.

### Edge Cases

We also need to consider edge cases where `total_squares` might be just below or above `x`.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration

- `n` has increased by 1
- `m` is 1
- `total_squares` is `n * (2 - n)`
- `x` is adjusted such that `n < int(x)`
- If `total_squares` is equal to `x`, `results` has a tuple `(n, m)` appended, and the loop breaks.
- If `total_squares` is not equal to `x`, the program continues without modifying `results`.

### Adjusted State for Next Iteration

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `total_squares` must be less than `x`.

1. **`n`**: Since `n` has increased by 1 in the previous iteration, we should specify its current value as `n` (after increment).
2. **`total_squares`**: This should be recalculated based on the updated `n`.
3. **`x`**: Ensure `total_squares < x` holds true.

#### Adjusting `total_squares` and `x`

Given that `total_squares = n * (2 - n)`, ensure:

- `total_squares < x`
- Consider edge cases: `total_squares` just below `x` and `total_squares` just above `x`.

### Final Adjusted State

- `n` has increased by 1: `n`
- `m` is 1
- `total_squares` is `n * (2 - n)`, and must be less than `x`
- `x` is adjusted such that `total_squares < x` and `n < int(x)`
- `results` remains unchanged as the program continues if `total_squares` is not equal to `x`

### State Representation

State: **`n` has increased by 1, `m` is 1, `total_squares` is `n * (2 - n)`, `x` is adjusted such that `total_squares < x and n < int(x)`, results remains unchanged unless total_squares equals x**
