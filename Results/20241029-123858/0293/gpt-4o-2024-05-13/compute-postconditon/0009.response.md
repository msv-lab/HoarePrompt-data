To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the provided state:

### Given:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `total_squares` is 1. If `total_squares` equals `x`, then `results` will contain the tuple (1, 1) and the execution will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- `while total_squares < x:`

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `total_squares < x`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `n` is 1.
   - `m` is 1.
   - `total_squares` is 1.

### Steps to Ensure the Loop Can Execute One More Time:
- Since `total_squares` is currently 1, we need to ensure that `total_squares` is still less than `x` for the loop to execute again.
- Given `total_squares` is 1, the condition `total_squares < x` will hold true for any value of `x` greater than 1.

### Conclusion:
- There is no need to adjust `x` since 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18 already satisfies the condition `total_squares < x`.
- The rest of the state remains unchanged as it does not affect the loop condition directly.

Therefore, we can simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

### State:
State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `total_squares` is 1**
