`results.append((n, m))` appends a tuple containing the values of `n` and `m` to the `results` list. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total_squares` is less than `x` and is increased by `(n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)`, `n` is less than `x`, `m` is increased by 1, and `results` has the tuple `(n, m)` appended**
