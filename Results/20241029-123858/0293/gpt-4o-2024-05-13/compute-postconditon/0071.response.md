Output State: **If `total_squares` reaches `x` during any iteration, the tuple `(n, m)` is appended to `results`, and the inner loop terminates. If `total_squares` exceeds `x` without equaling `x`, the inner loop terminates without modifying `results`. After the inner and outer loops, `n` is incremented to a value where `n` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. If `x` is such that no suitable `(n, m)` pair exists, the loops will continue until `total_squares` exceeds `x` or `n` reaches `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. If `x` is less than 1, the outer loop will not start, and all variables will remain unchanged: `n` will be 1, `m` will be 0, `total_squares` will be 0, and `results` will remain an empty list. `results` will contain all valid `(n, m)` pairs found during the loop execution.**
