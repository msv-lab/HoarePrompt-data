To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop: `m < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current Values:**
   - `x` is positive.
   - `m` will be incremented until it reaches `int(x)`.
   - `n` is less than `int(x)`.
   - `m` is equal to `n + 1`.
   - `m` is less than `int(x)`.
   - `m` is incremented by 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `m < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `x` is positive.
   - `m` was incremented by 1, so it is currently `n + 1 + 1` or `n + 2`.
   - `m` is less than `int(x)`.
   - `n` is less than `int(x)`.

4. **Ensuring `m < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`:**
   - For the loop to execute again, the current value of `m` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:

- We need to ensure that `m` which is `n + 2` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
- Given that `m` is incremented by 1, it should still be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

### Conclusion:

Since `m` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration and the loop condition is based on `m` and `x`, the state can remain the same to ensure the loop runs one more time.

State: **`x` is positive, `m` will be incremented until it reaches `int(x)`, `n` is less than `int(x)`, `m` is equal to `n + 1`, `m` is less than `int(x)`, `m` is incremented by 1**
