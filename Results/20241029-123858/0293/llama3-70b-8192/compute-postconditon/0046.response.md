To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to examine the condition of the loop and the states of relevant variables.

The loop condition is:
```
while m < int(x ** 0.5) + 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, the variable `m` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `x` is a positive integer
- `m` is incremented by 3
- `n` increases by 1 and is less than `int(x)`
- `m` is `n`
- `m` is less than `int(x)`
- If `func(n, m) == x`, the tuple `(n, m)` is appended to `tables`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **`x` is a positive integer:** This ensures that `x` is valid and convertible to an integer, which is crucial for the loop condition involving `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

2. **`m` is incremented by 3:** This indicates that in each iteration, `m` is increased by 3 units.

3. **`n` increases by 1 and is less than `int(x)`:** This ensures that `n` stays within a valid range for `x`.

4. **`m` is `n`:** This means that currently, `m` takes the same value as `n`.

5. **`m` is less than `int(x)`:** This condition is already given but needs to be checked against the loopâ€™s requirement.

6. **Loop Condition (`m < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`):** We need to ensure that the value of `m` after incrementing by 3 is still less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

### Ensuring the Loop Can Execute One More Time:

- To ensure that `m` can continue to be incremented and still meet the loop condition, `m` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` after incrementing by 3.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `m` is `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` (which is now `m`) is within the required range.

If we consider the end of the previous iteration, `m` (which is `n`) must have been such that `m + 3 < int(x ** 0.5) + 1` for the loop to continue.

### Adjusting the State:

- To ensure the loop can execute again, we should ensure `n` meets the condition `n + 3 < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
- Therefore, `n` (which is `m`) should be such that `n < int(x ** 0.5) - 2`.

State: **`x` is a positive integer, `m` is incremented by 3, `n` increases by 1 and is less than `int(x)`, `m` is `n`, `n` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) - 2`**
