To determine whether the loop can execute again, we need to evaluate the condition of the `while` loop:

```python
while m < int(x ** 0.5) + 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `m` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is 1
- `m` is 2
- `x` is an input integer
- `tables` is a list

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `m` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `m` is 2.

For the loop to execute again:
\[ m < \text{int}(x^{0.5}) + 1 \]

Given `m = 2`, this means:
\[ 2 < \text{int}(x^{0.5}) + 1 \]
\[ 1 < \text{int}(x^{0.5}) \]
\[ x > 1^2 \]
\[ x > 1 \]

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes again, `x` must be greater than 1. No changes are needed for the values of `n` and `m` since `m` is already 2, which satisfies the condition when `x` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is 1, `m` is 2, `x` is greater than 1, `tables` is a list**
