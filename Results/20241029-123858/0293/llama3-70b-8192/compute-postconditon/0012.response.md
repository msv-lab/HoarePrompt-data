The function returns `count`, which depends on the initial state described. The return statement does not change the state itself.

Output State: **If `min(n, m)` is greater than 0, `count` will be the sum of `(n - i + 1) * (m - i + 1)` for `i` from `1` to `min(n, m)`, and `i` will be `min(n, m) + 1`, and the function returns `count`. If `min(n, m)` is 0 or negative, `count` will remain `0` and `i` will remain `1`, and the function returns `count`.**
