Given the initial state and the provided loop code, let's analyze the output state after the loop execution.

### Initial State:
- If `x` is positive, `m` will be incremented until it reaches `int(x)`.
- `n` is less than `int(x)`.
- `m` is equal to `n`.

### Loop Code:
```python
while m < int(x ** 0.5) + 1:
    if func(n, m) == x:
        tables.append((n, m))
    m += 1
```

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs while `m < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - In each iteration:
     - If `func(n, m) == x`, the tuple `(n, m)` is appended to `tables`.
     - `m` is incremented by 1.

### Output State:

- **If `x` is positive**:
  - The loop will be executed as long as `m` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
  - After the loop:
    - `m` will be equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
    - If `func(n, m)` equals `x` at any iteration, the corresponding `(n, m)` pairs will be appended to `tables`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - **If `x` is zero or negative**:
    - The loop condition `m < int(x ** 0.5) + 1` will not be satisfied (as `int(x ** 0.5)` will result in a non-positive number for non-positive `x`).
    - Therefore, the loop will not execute.
    - `tables` will remain unchanged.
    - `m` will remain equal to the initial value of `n`.

### Final Output State:

Output State: **If `x` is positive, `m` will be equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, `n` will be less than `int(x)`, `tables` will contain any `(n, m)` pairs where `func(n, m) == x` during the loop execution. If `x` is zero or negative, the loop will not execute, and `m` will remain equal to the initial value of `n`, while `tables` will remain unchanged.**
