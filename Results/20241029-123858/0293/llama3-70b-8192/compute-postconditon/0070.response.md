`table` is assigned the value of the next element from the `iterator` over `tables`. The `iterator` will move to the next element of the list `tables`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **If `x` is positive, after the loop execution, `n` will be equal to `int(x)`; `tables` is sorted, and the length of `tables` is printed; `iterator` is moved to the next element; `table` is assigned the next element from `iterator`.**
