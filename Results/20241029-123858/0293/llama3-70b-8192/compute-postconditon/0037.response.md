`m` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `m` is not known but it is assumed to be less than or equal to `int(x)`. The other variables (`x`, `n`, `tables`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is positive, `m` is incremented by 1, `n` increases by 1 and is less than `int(x)`, `m` is `n`, and if `func(n, m) == x`, then a tuple `(n, m)` is appended to `tables`.

Output State: **`x` is positive, `m` is incremented by 1, `n` increases by 1 and is less than `int(x)`, `m` is `n`, and if `func(n, m) == x`, then a tuple `(n, m)` is appended to `tables`.**
