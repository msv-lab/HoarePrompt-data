`count` is incremented by `(n - i + 1) * (m - i + 1)`, where `i` is 3 and `min(n, m)` is greater than 3. The value of `count` before this increment is `2 * (n - i + 1) * (m - i + 1)`. After adding `(n - i + 1) * (m - i + 1)` to `count`, the new value of `count` is `3 * (n - i + 1) * (m - i + 1)`. The state of `x` and `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `count` is 3 * (n - i + 1) * (m - i + 1), `i` is 3, `min(n, m)` is greater than 3**
