According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the expression `min(n, m) + 1`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `min(n, m) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `count` is incremented by (n - i + 1) * (m - i + 1)
- `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < min(n, m) + 1` must hold true. Given that `i` is 2, we need to ensure that `min(n, m) + 1` is greater than 2. This means that `min(n, m)` must be greater than 1.

Thus, the state should ensure that `min(n, m)` is greater than 1.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `count` is incremented by (n - i + 1) * (m - i + 1), `i` is 2, `min(n, m)` is greater than 1**
