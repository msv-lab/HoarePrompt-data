Output State: **If `x` is positive, after the loop execution, `n` will be equal to `int(x)`; `tables` is sorted, and the length of `tables` is printed; `iterator` is moved to the next element; `table` is assigned the next element from `iterator`. If the `iterator` has more elements, the first and second elements of `table` are printed. If the `iterator` has no more elements, the `StopIteration` exception is raised, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The first and second elements of `table` are printed.**
