To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

**Given `while` loop:**
```python
while m < int(x ** 0.5) + 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

**State at the end of the previous iteration:**
- If `x` is positive, `m` will be incremented until it reaches `int(x)`.
- `n` is less than `int(x)`.
- `m` is equal to `n`.
- If `func(n, m)` equals `x`, then `(n, m)` is appended to `tables`, and `m` is incremented by 1.

**Step-by-step analysis:**
1. **Condition to execute the `while` loop:**
   The loop executes as long as `m` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

2. **Initial values provided:**
   - `m` is incremented until it reaches `int(x)`.
   - `n` is less than `int(x)`.
   - `m` is equal to `n`.
   - If `func(n, m)` equals `x`, `(n, m)` is appended to `tables`, and `m` is incremented by 1.

3. **Ensuring the loop will execute again:**
   - For the loop to execute, `m` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - This means that `m` needs to be less than the integer value of the square root of `x` plus 1.

Given that `m` is incremented by 1 at the end of the iteration when `func(n, m)` equals `x`, we need to ensure that `m` is still less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the state:**
   - Since `m` is equal to `n` and `n` is less than `int(x)`, we need `m` to be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` to ensure another iteration.
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `m` should be set to a value ensuring `m < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Since `m` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` and `n` is less than `int(x)`, we can adjust the state accordingly.

**Final adjusted state:**
State: **If `x` is positive, `m` will be incremented until it reaches `int(x)`, `n` is less than `int(x)`, `m` is equal to `n`, `m` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, and if `func(n, m)` equals `x`, then `(n, m)` is appended to `tables`, and `m` is incremented by 1.**
