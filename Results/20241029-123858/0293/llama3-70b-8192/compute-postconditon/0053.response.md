`m` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: If `x` is positive, `m` will be incremented until it reaches `int(x)`, `n` is less than `int(x)`, `m` is equal to `n`, and if `func(n, m)` equals `x`, then `(n, m)` is appended to `tables`, and `m` is incremented by 1.
