The value `(n, m)` is appended to the list `tables`. Since `n` is less than `int(x)` and `m` is equal to `n`, the pair `(n, m)` is added to the `tables` list. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **If `x` is positive, `m` will be incremented until it reaches `int(x)`, `n` is less than `int(x)`, `m` is equal to `n`, and `(n, m)` is appended to `tables`.**
