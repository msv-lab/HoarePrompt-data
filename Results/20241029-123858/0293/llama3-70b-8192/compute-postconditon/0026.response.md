According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `m` and `x`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `m` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `m` is 3
- `x` is greater than 1

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `m` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. Given that `m` is 3, we need `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` to be greater than 3. This means `int(x ** 0.5)` must be at least 3 (since 3 + 1 = 4).

For `int(x ** 0.5)` to be at least 3, `x ** 0.5` must be at least 3, which implies `x` must be at least 9 (since 3^2 = 9).

Therefore, `x` must be greater than or equal to 9 for the loop to execute one more time.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is 1, `m` is 3, `x` is greater than or equal to 9, `tables` is a list**
