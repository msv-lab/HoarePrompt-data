According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the expression `min(n, m)`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `i` is less than `min(n, m) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 4
- `min(n, m)` is greater than 3

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < min(n, m) + 1` must hold true. Given that `i` is 4, the condition will be satisfied if `min(n, m) + 1` is greater than 4, which means `min(n, m)` must be at least 4.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `min(n, m)` is at least 4.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `count` is 3 * (n - i + 1) * (m - i + 1), `i` is 4, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 4**
