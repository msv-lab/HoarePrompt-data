In the provided task, the `while True` loop will always execute again because the condition is `True`. Therefore, no specific changes are needed to ensure the loop can execute one more time. We just need to repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **If `x` is positive, after the loop execution, `n` will be equal to `int(x)`; `tables` is sorted, and the length of `tables` is printed; `iterator` is moved to the next element; `table` is assigned the next element from `iterator`. If the `iterator` has no more elements, the `StopIteration` exception is raised and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
