The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement immediately. Since the initial state is unknown, we don't have any information on the variables or their values. The only impact of this code is that it breaks out of the loop or if statement it is inside.

Output State: **and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
