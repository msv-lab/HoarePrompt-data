`tables` is appended with the tuple `(n, m)`, and `n` is 1, `m` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 1, `m` is 2, `x` is greater than 1, `tables` is a list with the appended value `(1, 2)`.

Output State: **`n` is 1, `m` is 2, `x` is greater than 1, `tables` is a list with the appended value `(1, 2)`**
