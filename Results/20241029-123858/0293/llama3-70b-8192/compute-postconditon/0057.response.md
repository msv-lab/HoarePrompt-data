`m` is incremented by 1. The given conditions state that `m` is equal to `n`. Therefore, after incrementing, `m` becomes `n + 1`.

Output State: **If `x` is positive, `m` will be incremented until it reaches `int(x)`, `n` is less than `int(x)`, `m` is equal to `n + 1`, `m` is less than `int(x)`, if `func(n, m)` equals `x`, then `tables` will contain the tuple `(n, m)`**
