To determine whether the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition in the `while` loop: `m < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `m` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `x` is positive.
   - `m` will be incremented until it reaches `int(x)`.
   - `n` is less than `int(x)`.
   - `m` is equal to `n + 1`.
   - `m` is less than `int(x)`.
   - If `func(n, m)` equals `x`, then `tables` will contain the tuple `(n, m)`.

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `m` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - `m` is currently less than `int(x)`, but we need to ensure that `m` is also less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` to guarantee the loop can execute one more time.

### Conclusion:
We need to ensure `m` remains less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

### Modified State:
Since `m` is already less than `int(x)`, we only need to ensure that `m` is also less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

State: **`x` is positive, `m` will be incremented until it reaches `int(x)`, `n` is less than `int(x)`, `m` is equal to `n + 1`, `m` is less than `int(x)`, `m` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, if `func(n, m)` equals `x`, then `tables` will contain the tuple `(n, m)`**
