To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop: `m < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. This condition depends on the values of `m` and `x`.

1. **Current Values**:
   - `m` is 4.
   - `x` is greater than or equal to 9.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `m` (which is 4) is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, we need `4 < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **Finding the Necessary Condition for `x`**:
   - Solving the inequality:
     \[
     4 < int(x ** 0.5) + 1
     \]
     Subtracting 1 from both sides:
     \[
     3 < int(x ** 0.5)
     \]
     This implies that:
     \[
     x ** 0.5 > 3
     \]
     Squaring both sides:
     \[
     x > 9
     \]

Given `x` is already greater than or equal to 9, we need to adjust `x` to be strictly greater than 9 to ensure the loop will execute again.

**Final State Adjustment**:
State: **`n` is 1, `m` is 4, `x` is greater than 9, `tables` is a list**
