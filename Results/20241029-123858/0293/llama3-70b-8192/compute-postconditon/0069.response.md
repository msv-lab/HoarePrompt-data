`iterator` is assigned the value `iter(tables)`, where `tables` is a sorted list. The previous values of `x`, `n`, and the length of `tables` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: If `x` is positive, after the loop execution, `n` will be equal to `int(x)`; `tables` is sorted, and the length of `tables` is printed; `iterator` is an iterator over `tables`.

Output State: **If `x` is positive, after the loop execution, `n` will be equal to `int(x)`; `tables` is sorted, and the length of `tables` is printed; `iterator` is an iterator over `tables`.**
