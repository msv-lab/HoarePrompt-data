To determine whether the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop's condition and the relevant variables. The loop condition is `m < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Loop Condition Analysis**: 
   - The loop will execute as long as `m` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   
2. **Current State Analysis**:
   - `x` is positive.
   - `m` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` increases by 1 and is less than `int(x)`.
   - `m` is `n`.
   - If `func(n, m) == x`, then a tuple `(n, m)` is appended to `tables`.

3. **Variables to Adjust**:
   - The primary variable we need to focus on is `m` in relation to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes Again**:
   - We need to ensure that `m` is still less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `m` is incremented by 1 and `m` is `n`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need `m` (which is now `n`) to be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Given the above analysis, we do not have enough information to determine the exact values of `x`, `m`, and `n`, but we can ensure that `m` (which is now equal to `n`) is still less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

State: **`x` is positive, `m` is incremented by 1, `n` increases by 1 and is less than `int(x)`, `m` is `n`, `m` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`**
