Given the initial state and the loop's code, let's analyze the output state step by step.

The loop executes while `m < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. This means that the loop will continue running as long as `m` is less than the integer square root of `x` plus one.

### Loop execution analysis:

#### Loop executes 1 time:
Initial State: The function `func` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `m`. According to the annotations, if `min(n, m)` is greater than 0, it calculates and returns the sum of `(n - i + 1) * (m - i + 1)` for `i` from `1` to `min(n, m)`. If `min(n, m)` is 0 or negative, it returns `0`, `x` is an input integer, `tables` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `m` is 1.
```
if func(n, m) == x:
    tables.append((n, m))

m += 1
```
Output State: The function `func` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `m`. According to the annotations, if `min(n, m)` is greater than 0, it calculates and returns the sum of `(n - i + 1) * (m - i + 1)` for `i` from `1` to `min(n, m)`. If `min(n, m)` is 0 or negative, it returns `0`. If the result of `func(n, m)` equals `x`, then `tables` will contain the tuple `(1, 1)`. Otherwise, `tables` remains an empty list. `x` is an input integer, `tables` is a list, `n` is 1, `m` is 2.

#### Loop executes 2 times:
Initial State: `n` is 1, `m` is 2, `x` is greater than 1, `tables` is a list.
```
if func(n, m) == x:
    tables.append((n, m))

m += 1
```
Output State: `n` is 1, `m` is 3, `x` is greater than 1, `tables` is a list.

#### Loop executes 3 times:
Initial State: `n` is 1, `m` is 3, `x` is greater than or equal to 9, `tables` is a list.
```
if func(n, m) == x:
    tables.append((n, m))

m += 1
```
Output State: `n` is 1, `m` is 4, `x` is greater than or equal to 9, `tables` is a list. If `func(n, m)` equals `x`, `(1, 3)` is appended to `tables`.

### Final Output State Analysis:

Based on the loop conditions and the function `func` behavior:
- The loop will continue as long as `m < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
- For each iteration, if `func(n, m)` equals `x`, the tuple `(n, m)` is appended to `tables`.
- `m` increments by 1 after each iteration.

Edge cases include:
- If `x` is 0 or negative, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` will be 1, so the loop will not execute.
- If `x` is positive but less than 1, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` will still be 1, so the loop will not execute.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **If `x` is positive, `m` will increment until it reaches `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` and `tables` will contain tuples `(n, m)` for which `func(n, m)` equals `x`. If `x` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute and `tables` will remain an empty list. After the loop, `m` will be `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.**
