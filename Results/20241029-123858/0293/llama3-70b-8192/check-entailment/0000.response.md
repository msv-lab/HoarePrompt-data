Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all cases as specified in the problem description. Here is an edge case where the program fails:

Consider the input `x = 9`.

Expected output:
```
2
1 9
9 1
```

Actual output from the program:
```
1
1 9
```

The code does not check beyond the range `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` for `m`, which means it misses pairs where one dimension is significantly larger than the other. For example, the pair `(9, 1)` is not found because the nested loop only runs up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, which is 4 in this case. Therefore, it misses valid pairs for larger values of `m`.

Additionally, the code should also consider the scenario where `n` and `m` can be larger than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` while still maintaining the condition `count_squares(n, m) == x`. This can occur because the number of squares in an `n x m` table is not strictly limited to the square root bounds provided by `int(x ** 0.5)`.

Hence, the program fails to meet the requirement for all potential cases described and is therefore incorrect.
