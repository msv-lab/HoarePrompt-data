RESULT: **Incorrect**

**Explanation:** The function does not correctly check all possible pairs of \( (n, m) \). It only considers pairs where both \( n \) and \( m \) are up to \( \sqrt{x} \). However, \( n \) and \( m \) can be much larger than \( \sqrt{x} \), as shown in the examples where the output includes pairs like \( (1, 26) \) and \( (26, 1) \). The current implementation will miss such pairs, leading to incorrect results.
