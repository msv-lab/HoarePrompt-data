To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Given State:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: After the loop finishes, `pleased` is equal to the number of friends' sets that are subsets of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]` in the last iteration where `j` was less than `m`. If `pleased` is greater than `max_pleased`, `max_pleased` is updated to `pleased`, `min_price` is set to the sum of `pizzas[i][0]` and `pizzas[j][0]`, and `ans` is updated to the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. If `pleased` is equal to `max_pleased` and the sum of `pizzas[i][0]` and `pizzas[j][0]` is less than `min_price`, `min_price` is updated to this sum and `ans` is set to the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Otherwise, `min_price` and `ans` remain unchanged. `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `m`. If `friends` is empty initially, the inner loop does not execute, and `pleased` remains 0. If `m` is less than or equal to `j`, the outer loop does not start. The variables `max_pleased`, `min_price`, and `ans` reflect the best found values according to the criteria during the iterations, variable `i` is increased by 1.

### While Loop:
```
while i < 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 0.

2. **Current State**:
   - Variable `i` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` must be less than 0. Since the value of `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to ensure that the initial value of `i` is less than -1 for it to increment by 1 and still be less than 0.

### Adjusted State:
State: **After the loop finishes, `pleased` is equal to the number of friends' sets that are subsets of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]` in the last iteration where `j` was less than `m`. If `pleased` is greater than `max_pleased`, `max_pleased` is updated to `pleased`, `min_price` is set to the sum of `pizzas[i][0]` and `pizzas[j][0]`, and `ans` is updated to the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. If `pleased` is equal to `max_pleased` and the sum of `pizzas[i][0]` and `pizzas[j][0]` is less than `min_price`, `min_price` is updated to this sum and `ans` is set to the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Otherwise, `min_price` and `ans` remain unchanged. `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `m`. If `friends` is empty initially, the inner loop does not execute, and `pleased` remains 0. If `m` is less than or equal to `j`, the outer loop does not start. The variables `max_pleased`, `min_price`, and `ans` reflect the best found values according to the criteria during the iterations, variable `i` is less than -1.**
