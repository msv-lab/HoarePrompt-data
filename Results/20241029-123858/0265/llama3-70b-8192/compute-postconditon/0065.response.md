Postcondition: **If `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]` is less than `min_price`, then `min_price` is updated to the sum of `pizzas[i][0]` and `pizzas[j][0]`, and `ans` is set to the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. If `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]` is not less than `min_price`, the values of `min_price` and `ans` remain unchanged.**
