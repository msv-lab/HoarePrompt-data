Since the loop condition is `while True`, the loop will always execute indefinitely, regardless of the internal state variables. Therefore, we do not need to adjust any states to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. We simply need to repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is incremented by 1, `pleased` is 0 or 1, `iterator` is a new iterator created from `friends`, `j` is less than `m`, `f` is the next value from `iterator` or `StopIteration` is raised and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `f` is a subset of `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, then `pleased` is incremented by 1.**
