Postcondition: **If `pleased` is equal to `max_pleased` and the sum of `pizzas[i][0]` and `pizzas[j][0]` is less than `min_price`, then `min_price` is updated to this sum and `ans` is set to the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Otherwise, if `pleased` is equal to `max_pleased` but the sum of `pizzas[i][0]` and `pizzas[j][0]` is not less than `min_price`, then `min_price` and `ans` remain unchanged. If `pleased` is not equal to `max_pleased`, the state remains unchanged.**
