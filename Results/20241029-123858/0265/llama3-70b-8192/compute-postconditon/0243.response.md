Postcondition: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is less than 0, `pleased` is 0 or 1, `iterator` is an iterator created from `friends`, `f` is the next item from `iterator`. If `f` is a subset of `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, then `pleased` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `pleased` remains unchanged.**
