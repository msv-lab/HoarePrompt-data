Output State: **`pleased` is 1 initially, `max_pleased`, `min_price`, `ans`, and `j` remain unchanged, `iterator` is assigned the iterator of `friends`, `f` is the next element of `iterator` if `iterator` has more elements, otherwise `StopIteration` is raised, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional block.**
