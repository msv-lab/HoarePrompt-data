To determine the output state after the loop has executed, we need to consider the values and relationships of the variables as they evolve through the iterations. Let's break down the steps and the output state based on whether `_` is initially less than 0 or not.

### Initial State:
- `_` is an integer.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5.
- `m` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5.
- `friends` contains sets created from the slices `f_i[1:]` of the input lines.
- `f_i` is a list of integers obtained from the final input.
- `pizzas` is an empty list.

### Loop Execution:
```
while _ < 0:
    c_j, r_j = map(int, input().split())
    a_jt = set(map(int, input().split()[1:]))
    pizzas.append((c_j, a_jt))
    _ += 1
```

### Analysis:

1. **Initial State Check**:
   - If `_` is initially 0 or greater, the loop will not be executed, and the initial state will remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - If `_` is initially less than 0, the loop will execute until `_` is no longer less than 0.
   - In each iteration of the loop:
     - Two integers, `c_j` and `r_j`, are read from input.
     - A set `a_jt` is created from the second element onward of another input line.
     - A tuple `(c_j, a_jt)` is appended to the `pizzas` list.
     - `_` is incremented by 1.

### Edge Cases:
1. **`_` is initially 0 or greater**:
   - The loop will not execute.
   - The initial state remains unchanged.

2. **`_` is less than 0**:
   - The loop will execute until `_` is no longer less than 0.
   - The number of iterations is equal to the absolute value of `_` initially.

### Output State:
- **If `_` is initially less than 0**:
  - The loop executes until `_` is no longer less than 0.
  - After the loop finishes:
    - `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5.
    - `m` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5.
    - `friends` contains sets created from the slices `f_i[1:]` of the input lines.
    - `f_i` is a list of integers obtained from the final input.
    - `pizzas` contains tuples `(c_j, a_jt)` for each iteration of the loop.
    - `_` is incremented to 0 (i.e., `_` equals its initial value plus the number of iterations).

- **If `_` is initially 0 or greater**:
  - The loop does not execute.
  - The initial state remains unchanged.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **If `_` is initially less than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `m` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5, `friends` contains sets created from the slices `f_i[1:]` of the input lines, `f_i` is a list of integers obtained from the final input, `pizzas` contains tuples `(c_j, a_jt)` for each iteration of the loop, and `_` is incremented to 0. If `_` is initially 0 or greater, the initial state remains unchanged.**
