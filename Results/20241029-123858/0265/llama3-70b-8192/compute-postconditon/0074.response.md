Postcondition: **`pleased` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `f` is a subset of `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`. `max_pleased`, `min_price`, `ans`, and `j` remain unchanged, `iterator` is assigned the iterator of `friends`, `f` is assigned the next item in `iterator`.**

Now, let's proceed with your task.

Precondition: `num` is an integer
Program fragment:
```
if num % 2 == 0:
    num += 10
elif num < 0:
    num = -num
else:
    num += 5

```
Postcondition for if body: `num` is increased by 10 if it is even.
Postcondition for else body: If `num` is negative, it is changed to its absolute value. Otherwise, `num` is increased by 5.
Postcondition: **`num` is an integer. If `num` is an even number, `num` is increased by 10. If `num` is odd and less than 0, it is changed to its absolute value. Otherwise, if `num` is odd and greater than or equal to 0, `num` is increased by 5.**
