Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer, `j` is less than `m` and increased by 1, `pleased` is the count of elements in `friends` that are subsets of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, `iterator` is exhausted. If `pleased` is greater than `max_pleased`, `max_pleased` is updated to `pleased`, `min_price` is updated to the sum of `pizzas[i][0]` and `pizzas[j][0]`, and `ans` is updated to the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. If `pleased` equals `max_pleased` and the sum of the prices of pizzas `i` and `j` is less than `min_price`, then `min_price` is updated to the sum of the prices of pizzas `i` and `j`, and `ans` is updated to the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. If the sum of the prices is not less than `min_price`, no changes are made. If `friends` is empty, `pleased` is 0.**
