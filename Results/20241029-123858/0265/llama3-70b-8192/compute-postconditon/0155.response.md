Given the `while True` loop, we know that the loop is designed to execute indefinitely unless a `StopIteration` exception is raised or another break condition is encountered within the loop body. Since the loop is guaranteed to potentially execute again under normal circumstances, we do not need to modify any state variables to ensure the loop can execute at least one more time.

The state at the end of the previous iteration will remain the same as it is already sufficient to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`max_pleased`, `min_price`, and `ans` reflect the best found values according to the criteria during the iterations, `i` is less than -1, `j` is less than 0, `iterator` is an iterator of `friends`, `f` is the next element from the iterator. If `f` is a subset of `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, `pleased` is increased by 1. If a `StopIteration` exception is raised, the loop breaks.**
