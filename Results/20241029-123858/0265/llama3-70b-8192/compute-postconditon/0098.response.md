Precondition: `a` and `b` are integers
Program fragment:
```
if a < b:
    a = b - a
else:
    a = a - b

```
Postcondition for if body: `a` is updated to `b - a`
Postcondition for else body: `a` is updated to `a - b`
Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are integers. If `a` is less than `b`, `a` is updated to `b - a`. Otherwise, `a` is updated to `a - b`.**
