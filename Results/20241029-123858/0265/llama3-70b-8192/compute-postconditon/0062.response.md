`ans` is assigned the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. The previous values of `ans`, `pleased`, `max_pleased`, and `min_price` are not changed. Therefore, the Output State is: `pleased` is a variable holding a specific integer value, `max_pleased` is assigned the value of `pleased`, `min_price` is `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]`, `ans` is a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`.

Output State: **`pleased` is a variable holding a specific integer value, `max_pleased` is assigned the value of `pleased`, `min_price` is `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]`, `ans` is a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`**
