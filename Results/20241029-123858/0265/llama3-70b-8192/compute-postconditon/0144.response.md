`f` is assigned the value of the next element from `iterator`, which is an iterator of `friends`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`max_pleased`, `min_price`, and `ans` reflect the best found values according to the criteria during the iterations, `i` is less than -1, `j` is less than 0, `iterator` is an iterator of `friends`, `f` is the next element from the iterator**
