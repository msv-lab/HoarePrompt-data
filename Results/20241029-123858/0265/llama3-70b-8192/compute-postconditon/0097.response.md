Postcondition: **If `pleased` equals `max_pleased`, then if the sum of `pizzas[i][0]` and `pizzas[j][0]` is less than `min_price`, `min_price` is updated to this sum, and `ans` is updated to `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Otherwise, `pleased` is the count of elements in `friends` that are subsets of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`; `max_pleased`, `min_price`, `ans`, and `j` remain unchanged. If `friends` is empty, `pleased` is 0. The loop terminates when `iterator` is exhausted.**

Now, here is your task:

Precondition: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer
Program fragment:
```
if a < b:
    a = b - a
else:
    a = a - b

```
Postcondition for if body: If `a < b`, `a` is updated to `b - a`
Postcondition for else body: If `a >= b`, `a` is updated to `a - b`
Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are integers. If `a` is less than `b`, `a` is updated to `b - a`. Otherwise, `a` is updated to `a - b`.**
