`ans` is assigned a tuple with values `i + 1` and `j + 1`. The values of `i` and `j` are less than -1 and less than 0, respectively. Therefore, `i + 1` is less than 0, and `j + 1` is less than 1.

Output State: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is less than 0, `pleased` is equal to the count of items in `friends` that are subsets of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, `iterator` is exhausted, `min_price` is the sum of `pizzas[i][0]` and `pizzas[j][0]`, `ans` is a tuple with values less than 0 and less than 1**
