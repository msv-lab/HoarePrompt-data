`pleased` is assigned the value `0`. The states of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `j` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer, `j` is less than `m`, `pleased` is 0.

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer, `j` is less than `m`, `pleased` is 0**
