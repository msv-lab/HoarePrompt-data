Given that the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will certainly execute again regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, we can simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration without making any adjustments.

State: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is less than or equal to 0, `iterator` is reset to a new iterator of `friends`, `f` is the next element from `iterator`, `pleased` is 0, `m` is greater than 0**
