According to the provided code, the `while True` loop will continue to execute indefinitely unless a `break` statement is encountered. This means that no specific conditions need to be met for the loop to execute again, given that it's an infinite loop by definition.

Therefore, the program state at the end of the previous iteration can simply be repeated to allow for the next iteration.

State: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is less than 0, `pleased` is 0 or 1, `iterator` is an iterator created from `friends`**
