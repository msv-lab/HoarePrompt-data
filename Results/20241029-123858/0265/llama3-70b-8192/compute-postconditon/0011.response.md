`f_i` is assigned the value of a list of integers obtained from `input().split()`, where `input()` accepts an input string and `split()` splits the string by whitespace into a list of strings. `map(int, ...)` then converts each string in the list to an integer, and `list(...)` converts the map object to a list.

The previous state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `m` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5, `friends` contains one set created from the slice `f_i[1:]` and has been appended with another set created from the slice `f_i[1:]`, `f_i` is a list of integers obtained from input, variable `_` is less than 0**
