`pleased` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 0, so after execution, `pleased` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is incremented by 1, `pleased` is 1, `iterator` is a new iterator created from `friends`, `j` is less than `m`, `f` is the next value from `iterator`**
