Postcondition: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is incremented by 2, `pleased` is the count of items in `iterator` that are subsets of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, `j` is less than `m`, `iterator` is exhausted. If `pleased` is greater than `max_pleased`, then `max_pleased` is assigned the value of `pleased`, `min_price` is assigned the value of `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]`, and `ans` is updated to `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Otherwise, if `pleased` equals `max_pleased` and `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]` is less than `min_price`, then `min_price` is updated to `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]` and `ans` is updated to `(i + 1, j + 1)`. If `iterator` is initially empty, the loop does not execute, and all variables remain in their initial state. If no items in `iterator` are subsets of `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, `pleased` remains 0.**
