Precondition: `pleased` is 0 initially, `max_pleased`, `min_price`, `ans`, and `j` remain unchanged, `iterator` is assigned the iterator of `friends`, `f` is the next element of `iterator` if it exists, or `StopIteration` is raised and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional block
Postcondition: **`pleased` is 0 initially, `max_pleased`, `min_price`, `ans`, and `j` remain unchanged, `iterator` is assigned the iterator of `friends`, `f` is the next element of `iterator` if it exists, or `StopIteration` is raised and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional block. If the set `f` is a subset of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, then `pleased` is increased by 1.**
