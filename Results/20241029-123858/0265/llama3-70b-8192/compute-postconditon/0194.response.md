Postcondition: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is less than or equal to 0, `iterator` is exhausted, `f` is the last element successfully retrieved from the `iterator`, `pleased` is the count of friends whose preferences are satisfied by either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, and `m` is greater than 0. If `pleased` equals `max_pleased` and `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]` is less than `min_price`, then `min_price` is updated to the sum of `pizzas[i][0]` and `pizzas[j][0]`, and `ans` is set to (i + 1, j + 1).**
