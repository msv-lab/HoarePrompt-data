To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the loop and the relevant states. The loop condition is `while _ < 0`.

### Analyzing the Condition
- The loop will continue executing as long as `_` is less than 0.
- At the end of the last iteration, `_` is less than -1.

### Determining the Required State
Since `_ < 0` is the condition for the loop to execute, and `_` is already less than -1 at the end of the last iteration, the loop can certainly execute one more time given the current condition.

### Conclusion
No changes to the state are necessary because the loop condition `while _ < 0` is already satisfied by `_` being less than -1.

State: **If `_` is initially less than 0, the loop will execute until `_` is no longer less than 0. After the loop finishes, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `m` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5, `friends` contains sets created from the slices `f_i[1:]` of the input lines, `f_i` is a list of integers obtained from the final input, and `_` is less than -1. If `_` is initially 0 or greater, the loop will not execute, and the initial state will remain unchanged. `pizzas` is [(c_j, a_jt)] plus the new tuple `(c_j, a_jt)`, `c_j` is an input integer, `r_j` is an input integer, `a_jt` is a set of integers from the second element onward of the input line, and `_` is incremented by 1. `c_j` is an input integer, `r_j` is an input integer, `pizzas` is [(c_j, a_jt)] plus the new tuple `(c_j, a_jt)`, `_` is incremented by 1.**
