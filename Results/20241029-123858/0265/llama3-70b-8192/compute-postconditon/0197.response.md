To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided `while` loop condition and the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

The `while` loop condition is:
```
while j < m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to continue executing, `j` must be less than `m`. We need to ensure that this condition is satisfied.

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `x` is a non-negative integer
- `y` and `z` are integers
- If `x` is 0, `y` is incremented by 1 and `z` is decremented by 1
- If `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5, `y` is decremented by 1 and `z` is incremented by 2
- Otherwise, `y` is set to 0 and `z` is set to 0
- `j` is increased by 1

Since the loop continuation depends on `j` and `m`, let's ensure that `j` is less than `m` for the loop to execute one more time. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` has been increased by 1. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `j + 1` must be less than `m`.

In other words, the initial state must have had `j` less than `m - 1`. 

So, if we want the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `j` is less than `m`.

State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer, `j` is less than `m`**
