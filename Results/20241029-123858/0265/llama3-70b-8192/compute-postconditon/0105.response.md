Precondition: `a` and `b` are integers, `j` is less than `m`, `pleased` is 0, `iterator` is an iterator of `friends`, `f` is the next value from `iterator`
Program fragment:
```
if f.issubset(pizzas[i][1]) or f.issubset(pizzas[j][1]):
    pleased += 1

```
Postcondition for if body: `a` and `b` are integers, `j` is less than `m`, `pleased` is 1, `iterator` is an iterator of `friends`, `f` is the next value from `iterator`
Postcondition for else body: there is no else part in the code
Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are integers, `j` is less than `m`, `pleased` is 0 or 1, `iterator` is an iterator of `friends`, `f` is the next value from `iterator`. If `f.issubset(pizzas[i][1])` or `f.issubset(pizzas[j][1])`, then `pleased` is incremented by 1.**
