The value of `_` is incremented by 1, and it is given that `_` is at most -1. Therefore, after incrementing, `_` would be 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `m` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5, `friends` contains one set created from the slice `f_i[1:]` and has been appended with another set created from the slice `f_i[1:]`, `f_i` is a list of integers obtained from input, variable `_` is 0**
