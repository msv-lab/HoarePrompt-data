Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again regardless of the condition of the program state. Therefore, the program state does not need to be modified in any specific way to ensure that the loop can proceed. The state can simply be repeated.

State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer, `j` is less than `m`, `pleased` is 0 or 1, `iterator` is an iterator created from `friends`, `f` is the next value from `iterator`**
