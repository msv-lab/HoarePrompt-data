Postcondition: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is incremented by 1, `pleased` is incremented by the number of `f` subsets found in either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]` before the `iterator` is exhausted, `iterator` is exhausted causing `StopIteration` to break the loop. If `friends` is empty, `pleased` remains 0. The loop will always start but will end when `iterator` is exhausted. If `pleased` equals `max_pleased` and `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]` is less than `min_price`, then `min_price` is updated to this sum and `ans` is set to `(i + 1, j + 1)`.**
