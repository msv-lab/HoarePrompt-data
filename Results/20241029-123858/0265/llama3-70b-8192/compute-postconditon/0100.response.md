According to the `while` loop condition, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `a` and `b` are integers.
- If `a` is less than `b`, `a` is updated to `b - a`.
- Otherwise, `a` is updated to `a - b`.
- `j` is increased by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `m`.

Step by step:
1. The current state of `a` and `b` is provided but does not affect the loop condition.
2. The state of `j` has been increased by 1 in the last iteration.
3. To ensure the loop can execute again, `j` must still be less than `m`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `j` is less than `m`.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers, and `j` is less than `m`**
