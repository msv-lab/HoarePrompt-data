`f_i` is assigned the list of integers obtained from the input, where `input()` accepts a space-separated string of integers, `split()` splits the string into individual strings, and `map(int, ...)` converts each string to an integer to form a list. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `m` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5, `friends` contains one set created from the slice `f_i[1:]`, `f_i` is a list of integers obtained from input, variable `_` is at most -1 and is increased by 1.
