The `break` statement does not change the state of any variables but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Without knowing the exact loop or control structure it is breaking out from, we can only state that it causes an exit from the loop or if statement.

Output State: **the state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
