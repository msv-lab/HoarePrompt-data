Since the `while` loop is `while True`, it will always execute the next iteration regardless of the current state. Therefore, we simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration without making any adjustments.

State: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is less than 0, `pleased` is 0 or 1, `iterator` is an iterator created from `friends`, `f` is the next item from `iterator`**
