The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside. Since the state of variables is unknown and `break` does not modify any variables, we can conclude that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **the state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
