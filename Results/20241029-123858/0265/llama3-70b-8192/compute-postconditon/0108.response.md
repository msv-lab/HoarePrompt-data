In this task, we need to ensure that the program state is modified so that the `while True` loop can execute one more time. Since the `while True` loop will always execute (unless a break condition or an exception is raised), we can simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration without modifications.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `j` is less than `m`, `pleased` is 0 or 1, `iterator` is an iterator of `friends`, and `f` is the next value from `iterator`**
