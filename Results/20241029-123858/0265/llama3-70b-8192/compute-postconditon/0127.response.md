Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are integers, `j` is less than `m`, `pleased` is incremented by the number of subsets of `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]` found in the `iterator`, `iterator` is exhausted, and the loop terminates when `StopIteration` is raised. If `iterator` is empty initially, the loop does not execute, and `pleased` remains 0. If `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]` is less than `min_price`, then `min_price` is updated to `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]`, and `ans` is set to the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`.**
