Given the initial state and the loop's code, let's analyze the potential output state.

Initial State: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5; each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9; `segments` is an empty list; `_` is assigned the value of `n`; `i` is -1; `j` is assigned the value of `n`.

Loop Code:
```python
while j < 0:
    if i != j and segments[i][0] >= segments[j][0] and segments[i][1] <= segments[j][1]:
        print(i + 1, j + 1)
        exit()
    j += 1
```

Now, let's analyze the loop execution step-by-step:

### Loop Execution Analysis

1. **Initial Check**:
   - The loop condition is `while j < 0`. 
   - Initially, `j` is assigned the value of `n`, which is a positive integer since 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5.
   - Therefore, the initial check `j < 0` will always be false.

Since `j` is always a positive integer within the given constraints and `j < 0` is always false, the loop will **never execute**.

### Output State

Considering the loop will never execute, the values of the variables will remain the same as their initial values.

### Missing Logic or Edge Cases

1. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition `while j < 0` is never satisfied given the constraints on `n`.
   - This condition can be re-evaluated to ensure it allows the loop to execute under the given constraints.

2. **Segments List**:
   - Since `segments` is an empty list, attempting to access `segments[i][0]` or `segments[j][0]` will result in an index error if the loop condition were to allow execution.

### Final Output State

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5; each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9; `segments` is an empty list; `_` is assigned the value of `n`; `i` is -1; `j` is assigned the value of `n`; the loop does not execute as the condition `j < 0` is never satisfied given the constraints.**
