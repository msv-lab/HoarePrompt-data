Given the initial state and the provided code, let's step through what happens.

Initial State: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5; each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9; `segments` is an empty list; `_` is assigned the value of `n`.

The loop:
```python
while _ < 0:
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    segments.append((l, r))
    _ += 1
```

The loop condition `while _ < 0` will determine whether the loop executes or not.

Given that `_` is initially set to `n` and `n` is guaranteed to be between 1 and `3·10^5`, it means that `_` will always be a positive integer initially. Consequently, the condition `_ < 0` will never be satisfied, and the loop will not execute even once.

Since the loop does not execute, the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

### Edge Cases and Missing Logic
1. The loop condition `_ < 0` ensures that the loop will never execute as `_` is always a positive integer initially. This is likely a logic error in the code, as it implies the intention might be to iterate based on a different condition.
2. If `_` were somehow negative initially (though this is against the given constraints), the loop might execute, but based on the constraints provided, this scenario is not applicable.

Thus, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5; each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9; `segments` is an empty list; `_` is assigned the value of `n`.**
