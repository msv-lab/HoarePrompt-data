The code attempts to print `i + 1` and `j + 1`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the variable `i`. Therefore, the program will encounter a `NameError` due to the undefined variable `i`.

Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1 and `j` is less than 0, `a` and `b` are integers, and `b` can be zero, and a NameError occurs due to `i` being undefined**
