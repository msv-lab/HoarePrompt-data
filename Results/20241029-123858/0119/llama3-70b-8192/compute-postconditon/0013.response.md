The value of `_` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `_` is less than -1, so after incrementing it will still be less than or equal to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5; each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9; `segments` contains the tuple (`l`, `r`) appended; `_` is less than or equal to 0; `l` and `r` are input integers**
