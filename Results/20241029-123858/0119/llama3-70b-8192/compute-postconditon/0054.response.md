Let's analyze the given task step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5
   - Each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9
   - `segments` is an empty list
   - `_` is assigned the value of `n`
   - `i` is 0
   - `j` is assigned the value of `n`

2. **Condition to Check:**
   - The `while` loop condition is `i < 0`

3. **Current Status:**
   - The loop does not execute because `i` is 0 and the condition `i < 0` is not satisfied.

4. **Required Adjustment:**
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than 0.
   - We need to modify `i` so that it meets the condition `i < 0`.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the value of `i` to be less than 0.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5; each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9; `segments` is an empty list; `_` is assigned the value of `n`; `i` is -1; `j` is assigned the value of `n`**
