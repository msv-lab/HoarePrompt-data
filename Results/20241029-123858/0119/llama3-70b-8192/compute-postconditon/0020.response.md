Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5; each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9; `segments` is an empty list; `_` is assigned the value of `n`; `i` is assigned the value of `n`; `j` is assigned the value of `n`. If `i` is not equal to `j` and the start of segment `i` is greater than or equal to the start of segment `j` and the end of segment `i` is less than or equal to the end of segment `j`, the program prints `i + 1` and `j + 1`, and the program terminates.**
