`segments` is a list containing tuples of the form (`l`, `r`). The values of `l` and `r` are input integers, and a new tuple (`l`, `r`) is appended to the `segments` list. The states of other variables (`n` and `_`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5; each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9; `segments` contains the tuple (`l`, `r`) appended; `_` is less than 0; `l` is an input integer; `r` is an input integer**
