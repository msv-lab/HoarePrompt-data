According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. However, the given state indicates that `j` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration.

Let's break down the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- If `i` is not equal to `j` and the segment at index `i` starts at or after the segment at index `j` starts, and the segment at index `i` ends at or before the segment at index `j` ends, then the function prints 0 and `n + 1` and exits.
- Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and `j` is increased by 1.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `j` must still be less than 0 after its increment. Therefore, the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration must be less than -1 (since `j` will be incremented by 1). 

No other states need to be adjusted as the loop condition only depends on `j`.

State: **If `i` is not equal to `j` and the segment at index `i` starts at or after the segment at index `j` starts, and the segment at index `i` ends at or before the segment at index `j` ends, then the function prints 0 and `n + 1` and exits. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and `j` is less than -1.**
