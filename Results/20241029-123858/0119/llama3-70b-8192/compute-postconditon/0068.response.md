Precondition: `a` and `b` are integers
Program fragment:
```
if a > b:
    a = a - b
else:
    b = b - a

```
Postcondition for if body: `a` is updated to `a - b`
Postcondition for else body: `b` is updated to `b - a`
Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are integers. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` is updated to `a - b`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `b - a`.**
