To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to look at the condition of the loop:

```
while _ < 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will only execute if `_` is less than 0. After the previous iteration, `_` is assigned the value of `n` + 1. Given the constraint that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5, `_` will always be greater than or equal to 2, hence the loop cannot execute as `_` is not less than 0.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `_` so that it is less than 0. This adjustment does not affect the other variables `n`, `l`, `r`, or `segments`.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5; each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9; `segments` contains the tuple (`l`, `r`); `_` is less than 0; `l` is an input integer; `r` is an input integer**
