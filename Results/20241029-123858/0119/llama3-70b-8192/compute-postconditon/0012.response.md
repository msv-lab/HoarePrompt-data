`segments` is a list that contains tuples (`l`, `r`) and a new tuple (`l`, `r`) will be appended to it. Variables `n`, `_`, `l`, and `r` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5; each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9; `segments` contains the tuple (`l`, `r`) appended; `_` is less than -1; `l` and `r` are input integers**
