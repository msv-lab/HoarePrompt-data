Precondition: `a` and `b` are integers, and `b` can be zero
Program fragment:
```
if b == 0:
    return "Division by zero"
else:
    return a / b

```
Postcondition for if body: The function returns "Division by zero"
Postcondition for else body: The function returns the result of `a` divided by `b`
Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are integers, and `b` can be zero. If `b` is zero, the function returns "Division by zero". Otherwise, the function returns the result of `a` divided by `b`.**
