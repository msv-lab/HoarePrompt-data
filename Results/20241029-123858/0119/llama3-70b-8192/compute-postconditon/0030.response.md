Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5; each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9; `segments` is an empty list; `_` is assigned the value of `n`; `i` is assigned the value of `n`; `j` is assigned the value of `n + 2`. If `i` is not equal to `j` and the starting point of segment `i` is greater than or equal to the starting point of segment `j` and the ending point of segment `i` is less than or equal to the ending point of segment `j`, then `i + 1` and `j + 1` are printed and the program exits.**
