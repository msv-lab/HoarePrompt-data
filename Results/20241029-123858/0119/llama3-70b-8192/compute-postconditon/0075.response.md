Output State: **`n` remains the same positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5); `segments` remains an empty list; `_` remains the same value as `n`; `i` remains the same value as `n`; `j` is not initialized since the loops do not execute. The loops do not execute because the condition `i < 0` is never satisfied. print(-1, -1) outputs -1 -1**
