Based on the provided initial state and the loop's code, let's analyze the behavior and state of the variables after the loop's execution.

Initial State: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5; each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9; `segments` is an empty list; `_` is assigned the value of `n`; `i` is -1; `j` is assigned the value of `n`.

Loop Code:
```
while j < 0:
    if i != j and segments[i][0] >= segments[j][0] and segments[i][1
        ] <= segments[j][1]:
        print(i + 1, j + 1)
        exit()
    j += 1
```

To determine the output state, we need to consider the loop's condition and the operations inside the loop.

1. The loop condition is `while j < 0`.
2. Variable `j` is initially assigned the value of `n`, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5).

Given that `j` starts as a positive integer, the condition `while j < 0` will immediately evaluate to false because `j` is never less than 0 initially.

Therefore, the loop will never execute, and the state of the variables will remain unchanged from their initial values.

Output State: **`n` remains the same positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5), `segments` remains an empty list, `_` remains the same value as `n`, `i` remains -1, `j` remains the same value as `n`.**
