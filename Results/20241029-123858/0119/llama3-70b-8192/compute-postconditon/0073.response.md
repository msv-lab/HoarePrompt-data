According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which does not satisfy the condition `i < 0`. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to a value less than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted since they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`n` remains the same positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5), `segments` remains an empty list, `_` remains the same value as `n`, `i` is less than 0, `j` remains the same value as `n`**
