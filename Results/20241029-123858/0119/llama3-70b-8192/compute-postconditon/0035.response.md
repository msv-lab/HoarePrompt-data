To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the `while` loop statement.

Given:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5; each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9; `segments` is an empty list; `_` is assigned the value of `n`; `i` is assigned the value of `n` + 1; `j` is assigned the value of `n`.
- The loop condition is `while i < 0:`.

To ensure the loop can execute once more, the condition `i < 0` must hold true. Currently, `i` is assigned the value of `n + 1`. Given the constraint that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5, `n + 1` will always be greater than or equal to 2, which means `i` will always be greater than 0. Hence, the loop will never execute with the current state.

To modify the state such that the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than 0. We can achieve this by setting `i` to a negative value. Let's choose `i = -1` to satisfy the condition `i < 0`.

Here is the adjusted state to allow the loop to execute one more time:

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5; each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9; `segments` is an empty list; `_` is assigned the value of `n`; `i` is -1; `j` is assigned the value of `n`**
