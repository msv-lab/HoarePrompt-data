Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly identifies two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that segment \(a_i\) lies within segment \(a_j\). Let's go through the logic and verify its correctness:

1. **Input Reading and Segment Storage:**
   The program reads input values correctly and stores each segment as a tuple \((l_i, r_i, i)\) in the `segments` list, where \(l_i\) is the left endpoint, \(r_i\) is the right endpoint, and \(i\) is the original index.

2. **Sorting:**
   The program sorts the segments first by the left endpoint \(l_i\) in ascending order, and in case of a tie, by the right endpoint \(r_i\) in descending order. This sorting ensures that for any segment \(a_i\) to be within \(a_j\), \(a_j\) must appear before \(a_i\) in the sorted list.

3. **Finding Containment:**
   The program iterates through the sorted segments while keeping track of the maximum right endpoint (`max_right`) and its corresponding index (`max_index`). For each segment, it checks if the current segment's right endpoint \(r_i\) is less than or equal to `max_right`. If true, it prints the indices indicating that the current segment \(a_i\) lies within the segment corresponding to `max_index`. If no such pair is found, it prints \(-1 -1\).

4. **Edge Cases Considered:**
   - **Single Segment:** When \(n = 1\), the program correctly outputs \(-1 -1\) as there are no pairs of segments to compare.
   - **Multiple Segments:** The program correctly handles cases with multiple segments, including those with overlapping and identical segments.

The program's logic and structure ensure that all potential cases are covered, and it meets the problem specification as described in the prompt. Thus, the program is correct.
