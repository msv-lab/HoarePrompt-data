Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop condition to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5
- `segments` contains one tuple (l, r, i + 1)
- `i` is the same input integer such that 2 ≤ i + 1 ≤ 3·10^5 + 1
- `l` and `r` are input integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9

Loop condition:
```
while i < 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check if the condition `i < 0` holds true. 

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition Check**:
   - The loop condition is `i < 0`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 0.

2. **Current Value of `i`**:
   - The current value of `i` is such that `2 ≤ i + 1 ≤ 3·10^5 + 1`.
   - This implies `1 ≤ i ≤ 3·10^5` (since `2 - 1 ≤ i ≤ (3·10^5 + 1) - 1`).

3. **Adjusting `i`**:
   - Given the current range of `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ 3·10^5), `i` is always positive, and it cannot be less than 0.
   - Therefore, to make the loop execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to be less than 0.

4. **Adjusting Other Variables**:
   - The other variables (`n`, `segments`, `l`, and `r`) do not affect the loop condition directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, the value of `i` must be adjusted to be less than 0.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `segments` contains one tuple (l, r, i + 1), `i` is less than 0, `l` and `r` are input integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9**
