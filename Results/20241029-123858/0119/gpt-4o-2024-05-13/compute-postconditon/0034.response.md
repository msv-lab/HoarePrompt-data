`max_index` is assigned the value of `index`. The previous state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: segments remains an empty list, `i` remains the same input integer (1 ≤ i ≤ 3·10^5), `l` and `index` are assigned the next values from `iterator`, `r` and `max_right` are assigned the next value from `iterator`, `max_index` is `index`.
