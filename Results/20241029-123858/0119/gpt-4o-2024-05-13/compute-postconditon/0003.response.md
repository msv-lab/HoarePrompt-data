`l` and `r` are assigned values from the input, which are split and converted to integers. Since the initial state indicates that `segments` is an empty list and `i` is an input integer, the output state after the execution of the code will reflect these changes.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `segments` is an empty list, `i` is the same input integer such that 1 ≤ i ≤ 3·10^5, `l` and `r` are input integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9**
