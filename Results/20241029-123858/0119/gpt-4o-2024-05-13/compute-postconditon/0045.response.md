The `StopIteration` exception might be triggered at the `l, r, index = next(iterator)` statement. This occurs if there are no more items to return from the iterator. If such an exception is raised, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If no exception is raised, the program proceeds to check if `r` is less than or equal to `max_right`. If this condition is true, the program prints `index` and `max_index`, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `max_right` is updated to `r`, and `max_index` is updated to `index`.

Therefore, the output state is: segments remain an empty list, `i` remains the same input integer (1 ≤ i ≤ 3·10^5), `l`, `r`, and `index` are assigned the next values from `iterator`. If `r` is less than or equal to `max_right`, the function prints `index` and `max_index`, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `max_right` is updated to `r`, and `max_index` is updated to `index`. If the iterator has no more items, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
