`i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is less than 0. Therefore, the new value of `i` is less than or equal to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `segments` contains two tuples (l, r, i + 1), `i` is less than or equal to 0, `l` and `r` are input integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, `l` and `r` are input integers**
