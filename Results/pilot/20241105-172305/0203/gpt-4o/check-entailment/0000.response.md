Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly initializes the queues to track the positions of 'D' and 'R'.
- It populates the initial queues with the index of each 'D' and 'R' characters in the input string.
- The code then processes the queues until one of them is empty, following the rules of the voting procedure where the employee with the smaller index eliminates the other.
- Finally, it determines the winner based on the remaining non-empty queue.
- The code logic aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases as described.
