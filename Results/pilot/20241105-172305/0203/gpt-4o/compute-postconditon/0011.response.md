Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. If the next character in `votes` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains indices of 'D' characters in the `votes` string along with the new index `i`. If the next character is 'R', then `r_queue` contains indices of 'R' characters in the `votes` string along with the new index `i`. In both cases, `i` is incremented by 1, and `v` takes the value of the next character in the `votes` string.***
