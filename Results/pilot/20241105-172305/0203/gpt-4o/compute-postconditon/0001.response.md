Example Answer: 
The input is stored in the variable `votes` after removing any leading or trailing whitespaces. The length of the string `votes` is equal to the value of `n`, which is a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**
