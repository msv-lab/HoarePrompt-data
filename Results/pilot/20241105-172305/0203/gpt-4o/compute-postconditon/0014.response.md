Example Answer:
The index `i` is appended to the `r_queue` list. The previous state of `r_queue` is unknown, so after the execution, the `r_queue` contains the appended index `i`. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `r_queue` contains the appended index `i`**
