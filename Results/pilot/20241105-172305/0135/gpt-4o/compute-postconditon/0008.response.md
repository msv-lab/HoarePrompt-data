According to the code, the loop will execute `k` times where `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set. Since there is no change in the state of the variables after the execution of the program fragment, the loop will execute one more time without any adjustments.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
