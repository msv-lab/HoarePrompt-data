Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set. If the `remainder` is already present in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables after the execution of the program fragment.***
