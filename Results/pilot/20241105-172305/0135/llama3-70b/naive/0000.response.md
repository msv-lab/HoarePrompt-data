Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly checks if all the remainders of division of n by integers 1 to k are distinct. It uses a set to keep track of seen remainders and exits the loop as soon as it encounters a duplicate remainder, printing "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes" indicating that all remainders are distinct. The program covers all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
