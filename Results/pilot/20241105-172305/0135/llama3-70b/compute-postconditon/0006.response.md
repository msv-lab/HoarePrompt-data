Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i`. If the value of `remainder` is present in the set `seen`, then the program prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, no changes occur in the variables `n`, `k`, `seen`, and `remainder`.***
