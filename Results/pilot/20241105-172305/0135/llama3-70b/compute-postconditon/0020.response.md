According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i + 1, `i` is increased by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration.
- The new `remainder` obtained in the next iteration should be added to the `seen` set.
- If the new `remainder` is already present in the `seen` set, the program will print 'No' and exit.

State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder` obtained so far, `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i + 1`, `i` is increased by 1**.
