According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `assigned` set. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is 1, the smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the `assigned` set, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is True, `assigned` set is not empty, and `x` is the first element in the `assigned` set. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in the `assigned` set, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop is broken.

To execute the loop one more time, the `assigned` set must still have elements in it, and the next `x` used in the loop should be the next element after the current `x` in the `assigned` set.

State: **`m` is 1, the smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the `assigned` set, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is True, `assigned` set is not empty with the next `x` element, and all other conditions remain the same**.
