Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem description. The program does not handle the case where it is not possible to perform the sequence of operations, resulting in an incorrect output. For example, for the input:
```
3
3 6 5
```
The program should output -1, but it will output 2 instead. This shows that the program does not work as expected for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
