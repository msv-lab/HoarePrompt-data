According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. 
Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are distinct positive integers in ascending order, and `m` is 1. Since the loop starts from 1, the value of `i` should be 1 at the beginning.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are distinct positive integers in ascending order, `m` is 1, `i` is 1**
