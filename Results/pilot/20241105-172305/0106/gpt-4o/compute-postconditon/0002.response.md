Example Answer:
The value of `floor` is calculated by dividing `floor_within_block` by `k` and adding 1. Since the initial values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are not provided, the specific output state cannot be determined.
Output State: **No specific output state can be determined without the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`**
