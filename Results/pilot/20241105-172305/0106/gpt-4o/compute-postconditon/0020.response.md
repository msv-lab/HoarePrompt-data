Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input. The values obtained from splitting the input are assigned to `a` and `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input**
