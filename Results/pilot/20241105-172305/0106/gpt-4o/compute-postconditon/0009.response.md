Example Answer:
`time_to_exit` is assigned the value 10 + (floor_a - 1). The value of `floor_a` is not provided in the initial state, so the calculation cannot be performed. Therefore, the output state is: block_b is the block number, floor_b is the floor number returned by the function `func` for apartment `b`.
Output State: **block_b is the block number, floor_b is the floor number returned by the function `func` for apartment `b**.
