Example Answer:
The variable `block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. Given the precondition that `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, and `a` and `b` are not equal, the output state can be determined based on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **No specific output state can be determined without the values of `apartment`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`**
