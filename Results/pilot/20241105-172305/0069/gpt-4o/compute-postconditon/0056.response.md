According to the code, the loop will execute if there is at least one element in the prefix_balances list. Since the loop does not execute in the initial state, we need to adjust the state to have at least one element in the prefix_balances list. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `prefix_balances` has at least one element.
State: **The loop does not execute, prefix_balances has at least one element**
