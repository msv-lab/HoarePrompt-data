According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is already incremented by 1, so no adjustment is needed there. The other states that need adjustment are `results`, `x`, `s`, `balance`, and `prefix_balances`.

1. `results` may need to be modified based on the loop body operations.
2. `x` should be assigned the integer value at `data[index + 1]` corresponding to the next index.
3. `s` should be assigned the value at `data[index + 2]` corresponding to the next index.
4. `balance` should be recalculated based on the new values of `x` and `s`.
5. `prefix_balances` should be updated to include the new balance calculation for the next iteration.

State: **`T` is updated according to loop body, `n` is already incremented by 1, `results`, `x`, `s`, `balance`, and `prefix_balances` are adjusted for the next iteration**.
