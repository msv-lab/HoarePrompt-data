Example Answer: 
A new value of -1 is appended to the results list. The loop will not execute if n is less than 1, so prefix_balances will remain initialized to 0. Therefore, the Output State is: The loop does not execute, prefix_balances is initialized to 0, results has a new value of -1.
Output State: **The loop does not execute, prefix_balances is initialized to 0, results has a new value of -1**
