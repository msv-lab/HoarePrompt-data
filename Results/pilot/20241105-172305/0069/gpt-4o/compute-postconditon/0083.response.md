Output State: **The loop calculates the prefix sum of the balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s`. If `n` is at least 1, then `prefix_balances` will be updated for each element. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop won't execute and `prefix_balances` will remain a list of zeros with a length of 1.**
