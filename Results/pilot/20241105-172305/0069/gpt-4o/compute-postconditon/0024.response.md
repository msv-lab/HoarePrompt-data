According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `prefix_balances`. If `prefix_balances` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `count` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `prefix_balances` has at least 1 element and `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`.
State: **`count` is 0, `prefix_balances` has at least 1 element, `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`**
