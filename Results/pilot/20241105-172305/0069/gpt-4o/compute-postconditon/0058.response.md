Postcondition: ***The loop does not execute, prefix_balances has at least one element. If both conditions (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 are satisfied, then count is increased by 1. This implies that the element in prefix_balances meets the specified conditions. No changes are made to any other variables or elements in the program.***
