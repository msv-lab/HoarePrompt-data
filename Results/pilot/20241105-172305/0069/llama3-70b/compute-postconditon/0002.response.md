Example Answer:
`n` and `x` are assigned values from the input after splitting. Since `T` is already defined as a positive integer and not affected by the code, the output state is: `T` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `x` is an integer from input.
Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `x` is an integer from input**
