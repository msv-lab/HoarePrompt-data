Example Answer:
The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the count of '0' and '1' characters in the string `s` respectively. The values of `s` are not provided in the initial state, so the output state will be `T` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `x` is an integer from input, `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the counts of '0' and '1' characters in `s`.
Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `x` is an integer from input, `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the counts of '0' and '1' characters in `s`**
