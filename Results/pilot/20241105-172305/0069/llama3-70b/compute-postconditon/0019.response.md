Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `x` is an integer from input, `cnt0` is the count of '0' characters in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' characters in `s`, `balance` is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`, `n` and `x` are assigned the integers from input.split(), `s` is assigned the input string. If the condition (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0 is met, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is printed. This covers all possible scenarios including the edge cases.***
