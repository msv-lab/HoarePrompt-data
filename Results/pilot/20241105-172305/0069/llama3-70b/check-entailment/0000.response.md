Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be handling all the cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly calculates the balance of the string `s` and then based on the balance and the desired balance `x`, it calculates the number of prefixes of `t` with the given balance. The code also correctly identifies cases where there might be an infinite number of prefixes. The output hints also align with the code logic and support the correctness of the program. Overall, the code seems to be correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
