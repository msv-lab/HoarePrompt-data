Example Answer: 
`result` is assigned the value of `n + (10 - remainder)`, where `n` is a non-negative integer input and `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 10. Since `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 10, it will be between 0 and 9. The value of `result` will be the sum of `n` and the difference between 10 and the remainder of n divided by 10. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input non-negative integer, remainder is the remainder of n divided by 10, and result is the sum of n and (10 - remainder).
Output State: **n is an input non-negative integer, remainder is the remainder of n divided by 10, result is the sum of n and (10 - remainder)**
