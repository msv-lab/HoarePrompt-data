Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of string `s`, `n // 2` is greater than 0, and `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. This condition covers all cases where the characters at symmetric positions in the string `s` are not equal.***
