Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly checks if a string is an "s-palindrome" by iterating through the first half of the string and comparing each character with its mirror reflection in the second half. If there is a mismatch, it returns False, otherwise, it returns True. This logic covers all potential cases of checking if a string is symmetric about the middle, making the program correct.
