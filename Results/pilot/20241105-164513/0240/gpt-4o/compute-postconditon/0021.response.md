Example Answer: 
`sub_counter` is assigned the frequency of characters in the `sub` string using the Counter function. The previous state of the variables is unknown, so the output state is: `s_counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of characters in string `s`, `sub_counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of characters in string `sub`.
Output State: **`s_counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of characters in string `s`, `sub_counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of characters in string `sub`**
