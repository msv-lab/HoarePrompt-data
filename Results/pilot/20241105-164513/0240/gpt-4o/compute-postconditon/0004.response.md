According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `chars`, which is not provided in the initial state. The loop can execute if `chars` is not empty. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to include `chars` as a non-empty string.
State: **`num_str` is a string, `sub` is a string, `chars` is a non-empty string**
