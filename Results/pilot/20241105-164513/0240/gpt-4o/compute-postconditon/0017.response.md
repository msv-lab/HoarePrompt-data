Output State: 
- `num_str`, `sub`, `chars` are strings. 
- `candidate` is the result of joining the permutations of `chars`. 
- If `func2(candidate, sub)` evaluates to true, the function yields `candidate`. 
- If the length of `num_str` is not equal to the length of `sub`, or if `chars` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and nothing is yielded.
