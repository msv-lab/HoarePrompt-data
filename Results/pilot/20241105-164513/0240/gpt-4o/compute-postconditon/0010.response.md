Example Answer: 
The code snippet yields the `candidate` value, which is the result of joining the next permutation of `chars`. The values of `num_str`, `sub`, and `chars` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `num_str`, `sub`, `chars` are strings, `candidate` is the result of joining the next permutation of `chars`.
Output State: **`num_str`, `sub`, `chars` are strings, `candidate` is the result of joining the next permutation of `chars`**
