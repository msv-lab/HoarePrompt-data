Example Answer:
The value of `n` is appended with the value of `t`. The loop iterates through each character in `s`, and if the character is in `t_set`, it is appended to `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an empty string, `n` is an empty string concatenated with the value of `t`.
Output State: **`t` is an empty string, `n` is an empty string concatenated with the value of `t`**
