Example Answer:
The variable `left` is assigned the value of 0. The values of `desired_counts` and `current_counts` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `desired_counts` is a dictionary where keys range from 1 to `m` with corresponding values from list `k`; `current_counts` is a default dictionary with integer values; `left` is 0.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary where keys range from 1 to `m` with corresponding values from list `k`; `current_counts` is a default dictionary with integer values; `left` is 0**
