Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary where keys range from 1 to `m` with corresponding values from list `k`, `current_counts` is updated to be different from `desired_counts`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. If all values in `current_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `desired_counts` for all colors in `desired_counts`, then the function returns 'YES'.***
