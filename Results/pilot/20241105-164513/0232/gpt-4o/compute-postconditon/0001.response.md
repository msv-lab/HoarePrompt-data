Example Answer: 
`current_counts` is initialized as a default dictionary with integer values. The keys and corresponding values in `desired_counts` are not affected by this initialization. 
Output State: **desired_counts is a dictionary where keys range from 1 to m with corresponding values from list k; current_counts is a default dictionary with integer values**
