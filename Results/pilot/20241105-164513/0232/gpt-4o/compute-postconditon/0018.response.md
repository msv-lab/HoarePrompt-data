Example Answer:
The value of the element at index `right` in the `colors` list is used as a key to increment the value in the `current_counts` dictionary by 1. The previous state of the `current_counts` dictionary and the `colors` list are not provided, so the output state is not determinable.
Output State: **Output state is not determinable**
