Example Answer: 
`counts` is assigned the list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting each element to an integer. The variable `colors` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights where n is the input integer.
Output State: **colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights where n is the input integer**
