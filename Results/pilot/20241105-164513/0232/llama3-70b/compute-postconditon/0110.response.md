Output State: **The loop calculates the count of each unique color in the `colors` list and updates the `window_counts` dictionary accordingly. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop is terminated. The variables `n` remains greater than 0, `i` remains less than `n`, `color_counts` dictionary contains the count of each unique color in the `colors` list. If the loop does not execute due to `n` being less than or equal to 0, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state where `color_counts` is an empty dictionary and `found` is False. After the if statement executes, the loop is terminated and `found` is set to True. All other variables retain their initial values.**
