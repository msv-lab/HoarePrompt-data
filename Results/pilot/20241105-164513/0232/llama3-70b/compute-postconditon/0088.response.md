Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `window_counts` is a dictionary where `color` is mapped to 1 if `color` was not previously in `window_counts`, `found` is True, `colors` is a list with at least `n` elements, and `color` is assigned the value at index `j` in the `colors` list. If `color` was not in `window_counts`, it is added to the dictionary with a value of 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. After the execution of the if statement, if all the counts in `window_counts` are equal to their corresponding targets, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks. The overall state of the program variables is consistent with the initial precondition, ensuring that all edge cases and conditions are handled appropriately.***
