Example Answer:
The count of the color represented by the variable `color` in the `color_counts` dictionary is incremented by 1. The initial state includes `colors` as a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers. After the execution of the if statement, if the color is not already in `color_counts`, it is added as a key with the value 0 in the dictionary `color_counts`. Therefore, the Output State is: colors is a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers; `color_counts` dictionary may have other colors as keys with their respective counts, and the count of the color represented by `color` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **colors is a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers; `color_counts` dictionary may have other colors as keys with their respective counts, and the count of the color represented by `color` is incremented by 1**
