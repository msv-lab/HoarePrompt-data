Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 1`, `window_counts` is a dictionary where `color` is a key with value 1 if `color` was not already in `window_counts`, `found` is True, `colors` is a list with at least `n` elements, `j` is adjusted to `j+1`, `color` is assigned the value at index `j+1`. If `color` was not present in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
