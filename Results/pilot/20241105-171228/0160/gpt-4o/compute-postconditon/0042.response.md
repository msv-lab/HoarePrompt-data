Postcondition: ***`divisors` is a non-empty set of distinct divisors of `sum_A` up to its square root, in sorted order in reverse, excluding the current divisor. If all elements `a` in `A` satisfy the condition that `a % d == 0` or `(sum_A - a) % d <= K` for the current divisor `d`, then the program prints `d` and breaks. Otherwise, there is no else part in the code.***
