Postcondition: ***`divisors` is a non-empty set of distinct divisors of `sum_A` up to its square root, in sorted order in reverse, excluding the current divisor and at least one more divisor. If all elements `a` in list `A` satisfy the condition `a % d == 0` or `(sum_A - a) % d <= K`, then the program will print `d` and break out of the loop or if statement.***
