According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the divisors set. If the divisors set is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, divisors is a non-empty set of distinct divisors of `sum_A` up to its square root, in sorted order in reverse, excluding the current divisor and at least one more divisor. For the loop to execute one more time, the set of divisors should have at least one more divisor excluding the current one.
State: **`divisors` is a non-empty set of distinct divisors of `sum_A` up to its square root, in sorted order in reverse, excluding the current divisor and at least two more divisors**
