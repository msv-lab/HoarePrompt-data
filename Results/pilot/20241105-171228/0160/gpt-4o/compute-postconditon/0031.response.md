The function `func` accepts a list `lst`. The function calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list starting from the second element. If the list has only one element, the function returns the first element as the `gcd_result`. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty or contains non-integer elements, which could lead to potential errors.

If the input list `lst` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, the loop inside the function will execute at least once. The loop updates the set `divisors` with all possible divisors of the input integer `x` up to its square root. If `x` is not divisible by any integer in the range of 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, then `divisors` remains an empty set. The final state of `divisors` will contain all unique divisors of `x` found during the loop execution and will be returned in sorted order in reverse.
