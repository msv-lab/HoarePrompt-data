Example Answer:
`A` is assigned a list of integers obtained by splitting the input. The values of `N` and `K` are not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: N and K are integers satisfying the preconditions, A is a list of integers.
Output State: **N and K are integers satisfying the preconditions, A is a list of integers**
