According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than 1. To execute the loop one more time, `N` needs to be adjusted to `N` is greater than or equal to 2. No other states need adjustment.
State: **N is greater than or equal to 2, K is an integer satisfying the preconditions, A is a list of integers, gcd is updated based on the gcd calculation**
