Example Answer:
The code returns the value at the index `n // 10` in the list `tens`. Since `n` is not defined in the initial state, we can't determine the exact value to be returned. Therefore, the output state is `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99; the list `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine.
Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99; the list `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine**
