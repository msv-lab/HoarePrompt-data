Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly converts an integer score to its word representation based on the specified ranges. If the score is between 0 and 9, it returns the word representation from the `ones` list. If the score is between 11 and 19, it returns the word representation from the `teens` list. For scores between 10 and 99, it returns the word representation of the tens place followed by a hyphen and the word representation of the ones place. The code handles all possible edge cases and scenarios accurately, as described in the problem statement. The output hints also agree with the code and confirm that it works as expected for all valid inputs.
