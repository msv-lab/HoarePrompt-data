Example Answer:
`dist1` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`, where `max_pos` is n-1. Since `n` is between 2 and 100, `max_pos` is between 1 and 99. Therefore, the value of `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and a number between 1 and 99. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is the position of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is n-1, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and a number between 1 and 99**
