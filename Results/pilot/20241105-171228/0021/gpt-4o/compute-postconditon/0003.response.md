Example Answer:
`max_pos` is assigned the position of `n` in list `a` using the `index` function. The value of `n` is known to be between 2 and 100, and the list `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`. Therefore, the position of `n` in `a` is the last index, which is `n-1`. Hence, `max_pos` is `n-1`. The other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is the position of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is n-1**
