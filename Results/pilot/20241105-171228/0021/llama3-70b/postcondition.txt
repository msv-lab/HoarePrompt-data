`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` stores the index of 1 in the list `a`, `posn` stores the index of `n` in the list `a`, `max_dist` is the maximum distance between 1 and n in the list `a`, and `min_dist` is the minimum distance between 1 and n in the list `a`. The code prints the maximum of `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`.
