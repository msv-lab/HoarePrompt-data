Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values and stores them in a list.
- It then finds the indices of the minimum and maximum elements in the list.
- It calculates the maximum and minimum distances between the minimum and maximum elements.
- Finally, it prints the maximum possible distance Nicholas can achieve after one swap.
- The code follows the problem description for all potential cases, as it correctly handles finding the minimum and maximum elements and calculating the distances between them.
