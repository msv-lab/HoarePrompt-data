Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, where n ranges from 1 to 10^9 and k ranges from 0 to 8. It calculates a multiplier based on the value of `k` and then computes the result `x` by multiplying `n` with the calculated multiplier. The function returns the final result `x`. **
