Example Answer:
`multiplier` is assigned the value `10 ** k`, where `k` can range from 0 to 8. Depending on the value of `k`, `multiplier` will be 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000**
