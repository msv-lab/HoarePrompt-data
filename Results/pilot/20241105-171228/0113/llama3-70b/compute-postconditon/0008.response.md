Output State: **If k is 0, the loop will not execute as n % x will always be 0. Therefore, n, k, and x remain the same. If k is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once and n will be the smallest multiple of x greater than the initial n, k remains the same, x is a value based on the new value of k that makes n % x not equal to 0**
