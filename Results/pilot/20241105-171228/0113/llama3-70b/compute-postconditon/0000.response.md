Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values from the result of `map(int, input().split())`, where the input is split by spaces, converted to integers, and assigned to `n` and `k` respectively. Since the values of `n` and `k` are not provided, the output state is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
