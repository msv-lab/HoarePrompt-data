Example Answer:
The value of `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`. After that, `min_time` is assigned the value of `time`. Therefore, the output state is: `min_time` is the result of `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is -1, `buses` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `s` is the first value of the first element in `buses`, `d` is the second value of the first element in `buses`.
Output State: **`min_time` is the result of `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is -1, `buses` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `s` is the first value of the first element in `buses`, `d` is the second value of the first element in `buses`**
