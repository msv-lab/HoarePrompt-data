Example Answer:
`bus_routes` is a list containing routes. `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of `bus_routes[i]`, where `i` is 2. Therefore, `s_i` and `d_i` now hold the values corresponding to the route at index 2 in `bus_routes`. The other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is either -1 or 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` now hold the values of the route at index 2 in `bus_routes`**
