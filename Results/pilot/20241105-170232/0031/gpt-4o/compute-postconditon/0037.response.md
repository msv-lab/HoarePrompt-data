The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The function follows the given constraints where if the initial value of `b` is non-zero, a loop will execute where `a` will hold the initial value of `b`, and `b` will hold the remainder of the initial `a` divided by the initial `b`. If the initial value of `b` is zero, the loop will not execute, and the function will return the unchanged value of `a` while `b` will be zero. The function returns the final value of `a` after the loop.

The function also has an additional condition where if `k` is greater than 1 shifted left by `n`, then the program prints 1, 1 and returns. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state after the execution of the if-else block.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, performs a loop based on the constraints provided for `a` and `b`, and returns the final value of `a` after the loop. If `k` is greater than 1 shifted left by `n`, it prints 1, 1 and returns.**
