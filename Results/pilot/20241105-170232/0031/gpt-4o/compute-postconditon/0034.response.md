Example Answer: 
The value of A is divided by g using the floor division operator. The previous value of A is the calculated value of p_shared. Therefore, after execution, the value of A is updated accordingly. The variables p_no_shared and p_total remain unchanged. 
Output State: **p_no_shared is either assigned the value of numerator if k is greater than 0, or it remains unchanged if k is 0 or lower; p_total is assigned the value of denominator; A is the updated calculated value of p_shared, B is the value of p_total**
