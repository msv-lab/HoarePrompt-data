Output State: If initial `b` is non-zero, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop, `a` will hold the initial value of `b`, and `b` will hold the remainder of the initial `a` divided by the initial `b`. If initial `b` is zero, the loop will not execute and `a` will remain unchanged while `b` will be zero. The function returns the final value of `a` after the loop.
