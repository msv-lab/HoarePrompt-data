Functionality: The function func takes two parameters, n and k. It calculates various values based on the input parameters and performs specific operations. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, the function prints 1, 1, and returns. Otherwise, it computes p_shared, A, B, and g based on the calculations involving total_days, numerator, and denominator. Then it calls itself recursively with A and B, updates A and B, and finally prints the modulo of A and B with MOD. It seems the function aims to perform a series of calculations recursively based on the input parameters n and k.
