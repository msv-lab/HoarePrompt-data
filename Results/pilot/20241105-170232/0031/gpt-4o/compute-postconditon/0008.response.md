The function `func` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. The precondition for these parameters is that `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^18. Depending on the initial value of `b`, the function will either enter a loop or not. If initial `b` is non-zero, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop, `a` will hold the initial value of `b`, and `b` will hold the remainder of the initial `a` divided by the initial `b`. If initial `b` is zero, the loop will not execute, and `a` will remain unchanged while `b` will be zero. The function returns the final value of `a` after the loop.
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b. If initial b is non-zero, a loop will execute at least once where a will hold the initial value of b, and b will hold the remainder of the initial a divided by the initial b. If initial b is zero, the function returns a unchanged while b will be zero. The function returns the final value of a after the loop.**
