Example Answer: 
`total_days` is assigned the value `2 ** n`, where `n` is an integer with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The calculation of `2 ** n` results in a very large number, which might exceed the constraints of the variable. Therefore, the output state is: `total_days` is a very large number.
Output State: **`total_days` is a very large number**
