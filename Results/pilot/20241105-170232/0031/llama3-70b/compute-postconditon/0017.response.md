Output State: **If k is greater than or equal to 0, `numerator` is the result of multiplying the product of total_days - i for each i in the range of k, `denominator` is total_days raised to the power of k, `i` is k, `total_days` is a very large number, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`, and then `denominator` is updated by dividing it by `gcd`. If k is less than 0, `numerator` and `denominator` will remain 1. The function returns numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3) and denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3)**
