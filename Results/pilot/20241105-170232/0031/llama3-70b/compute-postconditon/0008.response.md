Example Answer:
`denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`, and `denominator` was initially equal to `total_days`. After execution, `denominator` is now equal to `total_days^2`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is a very large number, `numerator` is the result of multiplying `numerator` by `(total_days - 1) * total_days`, `denominator` is `total_days^2`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`total_days` is a very large number, `numerator` is the result of multiplying `numerator` by `(total_days - 1) * total_days`, `denominator` is `total_days^2`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
