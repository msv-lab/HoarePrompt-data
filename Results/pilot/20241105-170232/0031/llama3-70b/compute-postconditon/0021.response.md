Example Answer: 
The function `func` takes in two integers `n` and `k`, calculates the numerator and denominator based on these values, finds the gcd of the numerator and denominator, updates both numerator and denominator accordingly, and finally returns the result of numerator modulo (10^6 + 3) and denominator modulo (10^6 + 3). If `k` is less than 0, the function returns 1 as both the numerator and denominator.

Output State: **The function `func` calculates the numerator and denominator based on the values of `n` and `k`, finds the gcd, updates both values, and returns the result of numerator modulo (10^6 + 3) and denominator modulo (10^6 + 3). If `k` is less than 0, the function returns 1 as both the numerator and denominator.**
