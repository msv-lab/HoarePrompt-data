Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seq` is a list containing the element 2 if `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and 3, `i` is 3. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the element 3 is appended to `seq` and `n` is decreased by 3. If `n` is less than 3, the program breaks out of the loop. If `n` is less than 2, `seq` remains an empty list.***
