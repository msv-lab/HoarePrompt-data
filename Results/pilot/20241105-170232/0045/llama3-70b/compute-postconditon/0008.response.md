The function `func` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^10. If b is greater than 1, then a and b will be updated based on the swapping and modulo operation until b becomes 0. Once b becomes 0, the loop will terminate. If b is 1 or 0 initially, the loop will not start. The function returns the final value of a after the loop terminates. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers a and b, updates them based on swapping and modulo operation until b becomes 0. Returns the final value of a after the loop terminates.**
