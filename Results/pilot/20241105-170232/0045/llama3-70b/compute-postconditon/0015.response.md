Example Answer:
The value of `n` is decremented by the value of `i`, which is 1. The previous value of `n` is the first integer input, and `i` is 1. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `n` is the first integer input minus 1. The value of `k` and `seq` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is the first integer input minus 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seq` contains 1, `i` is 1**
