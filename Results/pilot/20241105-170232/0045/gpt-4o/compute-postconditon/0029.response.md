Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the elements of the `result` list separated by a space after converting each element to a string. The values of `n` and `k` are assigned from the input after splitting them, and the result of the function call is stored in the variable `result`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting them, and the elements of `result` are printed as strings separated by a space.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting them, and the elements of `result` are printed as strings separated by a space**
