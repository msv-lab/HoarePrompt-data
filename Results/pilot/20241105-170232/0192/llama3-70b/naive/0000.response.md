Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program takes the input values for the side lengths of the equilateral triangles, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints the result. This logic correctly determines the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y starting from the equilateral triangle of side length x. 

For all the given examples in the problem description:
1. For input (6, 3), the program correctly calculates the absolute difference as 4, which is the minimum number of seconds required.
2. For input (8, 5), the program again correctly calculates the absolute difference as 3, which is the minimum number of seconds required.
3. For input (22, 4), the program accurately calculates the absolute difference as 6, which is the minimum number of seconds required.

Since the program provides the correct output for all the examples given in the problem description, we can conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements specified.
