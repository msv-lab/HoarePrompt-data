Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes two integers x and y as input and prints the absolute difference between them, which represents the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length x. 

The output hints state that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the code indeed handles this constraint. The code also correctly calculates the minimum number of steps needed to transform the triangle from length x to length y, as shown in the examples provided. 

Therefore, based on the code logic and the description provided, the code works correctly for all potential cases.
