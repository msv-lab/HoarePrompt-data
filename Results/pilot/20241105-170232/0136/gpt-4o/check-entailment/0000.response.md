Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two large integers a and b, removes leading zeros from both, and then compares them. It correctly prints '<' if a < b, '>' if a > b, and '=' if a = b. The code handles the case where both a and b are zero by assigning them a value of '0' if they become empty after stripping leading zeros. The logic of comparing the lengths of a and b first, and then comparing the actual values if the lengths are equal, aligns with the problem description. The code also efficiently reads the input using sys.stdin.read() to handle very large input sizes. The output hints confirm that the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
