Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing the input values, `a` is '0' with leading zeros stripped, and `b` is '0'. If `b` is empty, it is assigned the value '0'. No changes are made to `b` or any other elements in `data`. Depending on the comparison between `a` and `b`, the program prints '<' if `a` is less than `b`, prints '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, and prints '=' if `a` is equal to `b`. The program handles all cases where the length of `a` is less than, greater than, or equal to the length of `b`, and appropriately prints the comparison results.***
