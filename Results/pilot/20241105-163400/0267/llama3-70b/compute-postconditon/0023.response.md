The function `func` accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`. `l` and `r` are integers representing the range of values, and `k` is also an integer. The function performs certain calculations and updates a dictionary `dp` during its execution. The final result of the expression is returned after the calculation. The output is split into four cases, each denoted by Case_1, Case_2, Case_3, and Case_4, where the final result is returned based on the conditions evaluated within the function.
