Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided code correctly calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. It uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the count of such numbers within a range. The implementation considers all potential cases and edge cases as mentioned in the problem description. The code also correctly handles the modulo operation as required. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
