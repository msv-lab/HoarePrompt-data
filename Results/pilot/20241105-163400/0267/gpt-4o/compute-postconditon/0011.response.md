According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range of `num` from `l` to `r`. If `num` is less than `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l`, `r`, and `num` are integers with `l` being less than or equal to `r`. The update of `total_sum` depends on the evaluation of `func(num, k)`. If `func(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + l + 1) % MOD`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `num` should be less than `r`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num` are integers with `l` being less than `r` and `num` less than `r`**
