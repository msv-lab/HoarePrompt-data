Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` and then taking the modulo `MOD` of the sum. `num` is initially equal to `l`, so `total_sum` is updated accordingly. The states of `l` and `r` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_sum` is updated based on the calculation, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `num` is equal to `l`.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated based on the calculation, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `l`**
