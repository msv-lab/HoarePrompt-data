Output State: **The function accepts three parameters l, r, and k. It iterates through the range of numbers from l to r inclusive, calls func(num, k) for each number, and updates total_sum by adding the number and taking the modulo of MOD if the result is true. If l is greater than r, the loop does not execute. The function returns the final total_sum.**
