According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the result of `func2(x + 1)`. If `func2(x + 1)` evaluates to `True`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, variable `x` is increased by 3. To ensure that the loop can execute again, `x + 1` needs to be evaluated by `func2` as `True`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `x` should be increased by 2 to satisfy the condition for the next iteration.
State: **variable `x` is increased by 5**
