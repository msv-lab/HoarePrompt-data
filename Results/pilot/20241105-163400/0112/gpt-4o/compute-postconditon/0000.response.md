Example Answer:
Each cube has 6 faces with integers from 0 to 9. The list comprehension iterates over each cube and converts the faces into sets. Since the initial state does not mention the specific cubes or their faces, we can only say that each set in `cube_faces` contains the unique integers present on the faces of the corresponding cube.
Output State: **Each set in `cube_faces` contains the unique integers present on the faces of the corresponding cube**
