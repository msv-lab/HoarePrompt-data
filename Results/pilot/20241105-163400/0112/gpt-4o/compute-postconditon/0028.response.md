According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more characters left in the `digits` string to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 3 characters and `digit` is the third character. This means the loop can execute again. Additionally, the loop involves manipulating the `used_cubes` list based on certain conditions, so the size of the `used_cubes` list should also be adjusted to accommodate another iteration. The `found` variable being False and `n` being at least 1 do not affect the loop execution directly. 
State: **`digits` has at least 4 characters, `digit` is the fourth character in `digits`, `cube_faces` contains unique integers of corresponding cubes, `used_cubes` is a list of `n + 1` elements where some elements may be True based on the conditions met in the loop, `found` is False, `n` is at least 1**
