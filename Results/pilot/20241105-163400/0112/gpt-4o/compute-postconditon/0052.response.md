According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `data` is a list containing user input values split by whitespace, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `cubes` contains the sublist from index 1 to index 7 of `data`, `index` is 7, `i` is 0. 
To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be adjusted to 1.
State: **`data` is a list containing user input values split by whitespace, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `cubes` contains the sublist from index 1 to index 7 of `data`, `index` is 7, `i` is 1**
