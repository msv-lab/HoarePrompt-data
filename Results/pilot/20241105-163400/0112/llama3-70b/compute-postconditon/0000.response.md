Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` represents the number of cubes, which are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes. Each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers where each integer is between 0 and 9 inclusive.**
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes. Each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers where each integer is between 0 and 9 inclusive.**
