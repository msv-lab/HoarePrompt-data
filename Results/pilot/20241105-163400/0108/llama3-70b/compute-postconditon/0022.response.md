Example Answer:
The `replace` function replaces the next occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet. The replaced character is then stored in `res`. The `alphabet` remains defined and not empty. 
Output State: **`s` has the next character after `char` replaced with it, `res` has the newly appended character, `alphabet` remains defined and not empty**
