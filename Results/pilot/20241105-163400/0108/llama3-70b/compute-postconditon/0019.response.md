Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet. The replaced character is stored in the variable `res`. As `s` contains at least one more character from the alphabet, after the replacement, `res` contains the newly appended character. The variable `alphabet` remains defined and not empty. 
Output State: **`s` has `char` replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet, `res` has the newly appended character, `alphabet` remains defined and not empty**
