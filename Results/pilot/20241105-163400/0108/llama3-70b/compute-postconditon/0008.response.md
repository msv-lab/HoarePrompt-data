Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet. The replacement is done only once. The initial state does not provide information about the specific value of `char`, so the result will vary based on the actual value. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is a string with the appended character, `alphabet` is defined and not empty.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is a string with the appended character, `alphabet` is defined and not empty**
