Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the `res` string. The value of `char` is not specified, but assuming it's a lowercase English letter, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^5; `res` is a string with the appended character; `alphabet` is defined and not empty.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^5; `res` is a string with the appended character; `alphabet` is defined and not empty**
