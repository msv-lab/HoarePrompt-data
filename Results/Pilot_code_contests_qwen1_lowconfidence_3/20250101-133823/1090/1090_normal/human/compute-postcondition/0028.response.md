`maxSubLen` is assigned the value of the maximum between `j` and `maxSubLen`. The value of `j` must be at least 2, so the new value of `maxSubLen` will be the maximum of `j` and the previous value of `maxSubLen`, which is 1. Since `j` must be at least 2, the new value of `maxSubLen` will be `j` because `j` is at least 2 and thus greater than 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `len(str)` is at least 1, `j` must be at least 2, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is at least 1, `maxSubLen` is `j`, `t` is 0, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`**
