Output State: **`j` is `i + 1`, `k` is the minimum of its original value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]` where `t` is `0` if it was originally 0 or less, otherwise `t` remains the same, `maxSubLen` is the maximum value of `j` and `maxSubLen` during the loop iterations, `dp[i]` is the final value calculated by the loop and it is the result of the loop operations performed on `dp[i]` and `dp[i - j]` modulo `MOD`, `t` is `0` if it was originally 0 or less, otherwise `t` remains the same, `lastMatch[t + 1]` is the maximum value it was updated to during the loop iterations.**
