According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `1` to `len(str) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least `1` and up to `len(str)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and should still be within the bounds of `1` to `len(str) + 1`.

Given that `len(str)` is at least `1`, the next value of `i` would be `len(str) + 1`.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `dp[i]` is updated to the final value calculated by iterating through the loop.
- `len(str)` is at least `1`.
- `j` is the final value after all iterations.
- `k` is the final value after all iterations.
- `i` is now `len(str) + 1` (the next value for `i`).
- `maxSubLen` remains the same as it is not dependent on `i`.
- `t` is `i - j - 1` if `i - j - 1` is greater than 0, else 0. Since `i` is now `len(str) + 1`, `t` will be `(len(str) + 1) - j - 1 = len(str) - j`.
- `lastMatch[t + 1]` and `lastMatch[i - j]` are the maximum values they were updated to during the loop iterations.
- `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum value it was updated to during the loop iterations.
- `arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]` is the initial value used to assign `k`.

State: **`dp[i]` is updated to the final value calculated by iterating through the loop, `len(str)` is at least 1, `j` is the final value after all iterations, `k` is the final value after all iterations, `i` is `len(str) + 1`, `maxSubLen` is the maximum value of `j` during the loop iterations, `t` is `len(str) - j` if `len(str) - j` is greater than 0, else 0, `lastMatch[t + 1]` and `lastMatch[i - j]` are the maximum values they were updated to during the loop iterations, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum value it was updated to during the loop iterations, `arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]` is the initial value used to assign `k`.**
