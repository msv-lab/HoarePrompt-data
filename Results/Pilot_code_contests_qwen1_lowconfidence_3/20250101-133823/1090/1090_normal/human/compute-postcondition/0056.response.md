`maxSubLen` is updated to be the maximum of `j` and `maxSubLen`. Since `j` is increased by 1 from the previous iteration, the new value of `j` is `j_prev + 1`. However, without knowing the exact value of `maxSubLen` from the previous state, we can express `maxSubLen` as either `j_prev` or `j_prev + 1`, depending on which is larger.

The output state will include the updated value of `maxSubLen` and the fact that `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`maxSubLen` is the maximum of `j_prev + 1` and `maxSubLen`; `j` is increased by 1**
