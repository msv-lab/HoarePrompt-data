The code updates the value of `lastMatch[t + 1]` to be the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

- `maxSubLen` remains the maximum of `j_prev + 1` and `maxSubLen`.
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`.
- `t` is set to `i - j - 1`.
- `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`maxSubLen` is the maximum of `j_prev + 1` and `maxSubLen`; `j` is `j + 1`; `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`; `t` is `i - j - 1`; `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.**
