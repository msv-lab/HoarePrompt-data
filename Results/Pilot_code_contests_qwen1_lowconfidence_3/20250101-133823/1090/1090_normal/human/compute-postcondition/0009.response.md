`lastMatch[i]` is assigned the value `i`. This means every element in the `lastMatch` list is now set to its index. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters, `str` is a string (the input from the user), `arr` is a list of evaluated expressions, `MOD` is `1000000007.0`, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is its index `i`, and `len(lastMatch)` is 3200.**
