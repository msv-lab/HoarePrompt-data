The code assigns the value of `i - j - 1` to the variable `t`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly used in this assignment, so they remain unchanged. The value of `t` is calculated based on the given values of `i` and `j`. The `len(str)`, `dp[i]`, `MOD`, and `maxSubLen` variables are not affected.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `len(str)` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, `maxSubLen` is 1, `t` is `i - j - 1`**
