The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`. However, the initial state does not provide the values of `dp`, `i`, `j`, `MOD`, and `k`. Since `j` is given as 1, the code simplifies to:

\[ dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - 1]) \% MOD \]

Given that `j` is 1, the impact of the code on the program is that `dp[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `dp[i - 1]`. The values of other variables like `k` and `i` are not specified in the initial state, so they remain unknown.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `k` must be at least 1, `i` must be at least 1, `maxSubLen` is 1, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - 1]) \% MOD`**
