The code initializes `maxSubLen` to 0. This variable is used to store the maximum length of a substring, but it is not modified by the given code snippet. All other variables remain in their initial state as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters, `str` is a string (the input from the user), `arr` is a list of evaluated expressions, `MOD` is `1000000007.0`, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is its index `i`, `len(lastMatch)` is 3200, `maxSubLen` is 0.**
