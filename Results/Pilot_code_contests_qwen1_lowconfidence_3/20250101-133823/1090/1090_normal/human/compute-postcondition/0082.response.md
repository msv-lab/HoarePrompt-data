The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` was 1, so now `j` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 2, `k` is `min(k, arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')])`, `i` must be at least 1, `maxSubLen` is 1, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - 1]) % MOD`, `t` is 0, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `k` is `min(k, arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')])`, `i` must be at least 1, `maxSubLen` is 1, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - 1]) % MOD`, `t` is 0, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`**
