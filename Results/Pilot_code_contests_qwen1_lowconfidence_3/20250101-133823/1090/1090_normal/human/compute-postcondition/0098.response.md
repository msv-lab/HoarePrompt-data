`j` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` is the original value of `j` plus 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is the minimum of its current value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of `j` and its current value and `maxSubLen`, `j` is increased by 1, `t` is `0` if it was originally 0 or less, `t` is unchanged if it was originally greater than 0, `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`**
