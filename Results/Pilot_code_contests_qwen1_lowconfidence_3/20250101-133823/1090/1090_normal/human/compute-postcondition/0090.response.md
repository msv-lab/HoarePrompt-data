`j` is incremented by 1, which means its new value is its original value plus 1. The values of the other variables (`k`, `dp[i]`, `maxSubLen`, `t`, `lastMatch[t + 1]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `j`, `j` is increased by 1, `t` is `i - j - 1` if `i - j - 1 > 0` else `0`, `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.**
