Let's break down the given loop condition and the state at the end of the previous iteration step by step:

### Given Loop Condition:
```python
while j <= k and i - j >= 0:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`
- `len(str)` is at least 1
- `j` is increased by 1 (meaning `j` is now `j + 1`)
- `k` is the minimum of its original value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`
- `i` is at least 1
- `maxSubLen` is `j`
- `t` is `i - j - 1` if `i - j - 1` is greater than 0, else 0
- `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`
- `lastMatch[i - j]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j <= k` and `i - j >= 0`.
   - We need to ensure both conditions are met for the next iteration.

2. **Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is increased by 1, so the new value of `j` is `j + 1`.
   - `k` remains as it was, but we know `k` is the minimum of its original value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`.

3. **Check the Conditions**:
   - For `j <= k` to be true in the next iteration, `j + 1` must be less than or equal to `k`. Therefore, `k` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1`.
   - For `i - j >= 0` to be true in the next iteration, `i - (j + 1)` must be greater than or equal to 0. This means `i - j - 1 >= 0`, which simplifies to `i - j >= 1`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - We need to ensure that `k >= j + 1` for the loop to continue.
   - We also need to ensure that `i - j >= 1` for the loop to continue.

Given these conditions, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1`.
- `i - j` must be greater than or equal to 1.

### Final State:
State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `len(str)` is at least 1, `j` is increased by 1, `k` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1`, `i` is at least 1, `maxSubLen` is `j`, `t` is `i - j - 1` if `i - j - 1` is greater than 0, else 0, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`, `lastMatch[i - j]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`**.
