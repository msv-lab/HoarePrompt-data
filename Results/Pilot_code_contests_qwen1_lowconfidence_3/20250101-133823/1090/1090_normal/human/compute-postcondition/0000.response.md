`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which reads a string from the user and converts it to an integer. The value of `s` and the list of integers `a1, a2, ..., a26` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10³, `s` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase English letters, and `a1, a2, ..., a26` are 26 integers such that 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10³.**
