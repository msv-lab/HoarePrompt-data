Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `maxSubLen` is the maximum of `j_prev + 1` and `maxSubLen`.
   - `j` is `j + 1`.
   - `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`.
   - `t` is `i - j - 1`.
   - `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.
   - `t` is `t if t > 0 else 0`.
   - `k` is the minimum of its original value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`.
   - `j` is incremented by 1.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `while j <= k and i - j >= 0`.

3. **Analyzing the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, two conditions must be met:
     - `j` must be less than or equal to `k`.
     - `i - j` must be greater than or equal to 0.

4. **State Analysis**:
   - From the previous iteration, we know:
     - `j` is `j + 1` (incremented by 1 from the previous state).
     - `i` remains unchanged as no explicit update is mentioned.
     - `k` is the minimum of its original value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`, so it could have changed based on the value of `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`.
     - `j` is now `j + 1`.

5. **Ensuring the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - To ensure `j <= k`, `k` must be at least `j + 1`.
   - To ensure `i - j >= 0`, `j` must be less than or equal to `i`.

6. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least `j + 1` to satisfy `j <= k`.
   - Additionally, `i` should be such that `i - (j + 1) >= 0`.

Therefore, the state adjustments required are:
- `k` must be at least `j + 1`.
- `i` must be such that `i - (j + 1) >= 0`.

State: **`maxSubLen` is the maximum of `j_prev + 1` and `maxSubLen`; `j` is `j + 1`; `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`; `t` is `i - j - 1`; `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`; `t` is `t if t > 0 else 0`; `k` is the minimum of its original value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`; `j` is incremented by 1; `k` must be at least `j + 1`; `i` must be such that `i - (j + 1) >= 0`.
