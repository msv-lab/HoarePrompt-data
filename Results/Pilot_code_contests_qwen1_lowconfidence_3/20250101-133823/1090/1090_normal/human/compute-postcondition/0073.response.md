The code snippet sets `j` to 1, changing its value from its initial state. The other variables (`maxSubLen`, `dp[i]`, `t`, `lastMatch[t + 1]`, `lastMatch[i - 1]`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `maxSubLen` is the maximum length of the valid substring found during the loop iterations, `dp[i]` is the final value calculated by the loop, `t` is 0, `lastMatch[t + 1]` is the maximum value it was updated to during the loop iterations, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum value it was updated to during the loop iterations, `k` is the minimum value it was updated to during the loop iterations**
