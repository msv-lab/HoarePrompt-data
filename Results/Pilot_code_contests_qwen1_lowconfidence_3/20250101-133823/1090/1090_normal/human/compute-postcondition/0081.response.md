The code updates the value of `k` to the minimum between the current value of `k` and the value of `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`. However, since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `arr`, we cannot determine the exact value of `k` after the operation. We only know that `k` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `k` is min(k, arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]), `i` must be at least 1, `maxSubLen` is 1, `dp[i]` is updated to (dp[i] + dp[i - 1]) % MOD, `t` is 0, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and i - 1**
