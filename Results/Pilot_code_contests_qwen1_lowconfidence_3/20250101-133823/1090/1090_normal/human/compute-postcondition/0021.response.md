The code snippet `dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD` updates the value of `dp[i]`. However, the initial values and the specific values of `dp[i]`, `dp[i - j]`, and `MOD` are not provided. Since the initial state only specifies that `len(str)` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, and `maxSubLen` is 1, these variables are not directly affected by the code. The only variable that changes is `dp[i]`, which is updated based on the value of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - j]`.

Since the exact values of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - j]` are not specified, we can only say that `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `len(str)` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, `maxSubLen` is 1**
