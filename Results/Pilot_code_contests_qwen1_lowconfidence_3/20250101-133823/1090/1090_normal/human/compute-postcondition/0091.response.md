To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the `while` loop will continue to execute. The loop condition is `j <= k and i - j >= 0`.

Let's break down the loop condition:

1. `j <= k`: This means that `j` must be less than or equal to `k` for the loop to continue.
2. `i - j >= 0`: This means that `i - j` must be non-negative for the loop to continue.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `k` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`.
- `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`.
- `maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `j`.
- `j` is increased by 1.
- `t` is `i - j - 1` if `i - j - 1 > 0` else `0`.
- `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.

We need to ensure that both conditions of the loop (`j <= k` and `i - j >= 0`) are satisfied for the loop to continue.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition `j <= k`**:
   - Since `j` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to continue, `j` must be less than or equal to `k` after the update.
   - Therefore, `j` must be less than or equal to `k` at the start of the next iteration.

2. **Condition `i - j >= 0`**:
   - This condition ensures that `i - j` is non-negative.
   - Given that `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for `i - j >= 0` to hold, `j` must be less than `i` at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since `i` does not change within the loop, we need to ensure that `j` is less than `i`.

### Adjusted States:

- `j` must be less than or equal to `k` to satisfy the first condition.
- `j` must be less than `i` to satisfy the second condition.

Therefore, we need to adjust the states to ensure these conditions hold for the next iteration.

### Final Answer:

State: **`k` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `j`, `j` is increased by 1, `t` is `i - j - 1` if `i - j - 1 > 0` else `0`, `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`, `j` must be less than or equal to `k` and less than `i`**.
