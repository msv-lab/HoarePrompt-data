The code snippet `lastMatch[i] = i` assigns the value of `i` to the index `i` in the list `lastMatch`. Given that `i` is 3200, this assignment updates the value of `lastMatch[3200]` to 3200. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters, `str` is a string (the input from the user), `arr` is a list of evaluated expressions, `MOD` is `1000000007.0`, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where `lastMatch[3200]` is 3200, `i` is 3200, and `len(lastMatch)` is 3200**
