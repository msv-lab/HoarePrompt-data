The variable `subNum` is assigned the value `0`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State, except for the new assignment to `subNum`.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is the final value calculated by the loop operations, `j` is `i + 1`, `k` is the minimum value it was updated to during the loop iterations, `maxSubLen` is the maximum value of `j` during the loop iterations, `t` is `0` if `i - j - 1` is 0 or less, otherwise `t` is `i - j - 1`, `lastMatch` contains the maximum values it was updated to during the loop iterations, `arr`, `MOD`, `n`, `s`, `str`, `lastStrIndex` is `len(str) - 1`, `maxSubLen`, `dp[0]`, and `lastIndex` is 0, `subNum` is 0.**
