The code updates the variable `k` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`.
- `len(str)` is at least 1.
- `j` is increased by 1.
- `k` is updated to `min(k, arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')])`.
- `i` is at least 1.
- `maxSubLen` is `max(j + 1, maxSubLen)`.
- `t` is `i - j - 1` if `i - j - 1` is greater than 0, else 0.
- `lastMatch[t + 1]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.

The output state is:

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `len(str)` is at least 1, `j` is increased by 1, `k` is updated to `min(k, arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')])`, `i` is at least 1, `maxSubLen` is `max(j + 1, maxSubLen)`, `t` is `i - j - 1` if `i - j - 1` is greater than 0, else 0, `lastMatch[t + 1]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.**
