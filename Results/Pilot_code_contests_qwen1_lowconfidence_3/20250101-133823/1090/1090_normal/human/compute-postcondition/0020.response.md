The code updates `maxSubLen` to be the maximum value between `j` and `maxSubLen`. Since `maxSubLen` was initially undefined, it will take the value of `j`, which is 1. The states of the other variables (`len(str)`, `i`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(str)` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, `maxSubLen` is 1**
