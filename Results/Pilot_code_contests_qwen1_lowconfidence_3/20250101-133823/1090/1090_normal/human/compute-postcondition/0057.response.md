The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`. However, the initial values of `dp`, `i`, `j`, `j_prev`, `maxSubLen`, and `MOD` are not specified in the initial state. Given the initial state, we can only describe the changes made by the code.

- `j` is increased by 1.
- `dp[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - j]`.

Since the exact values of `dp`, `i`, `j`, `j_prev`, `maxSubLen`, and `MOD` are not provided, we can only describe the general state after the code execution.

Output State: **`maxSubLen` is the maximum of `j_prev + 1` and `maxSubLen`; `j` is `j + 1`; `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`.**
