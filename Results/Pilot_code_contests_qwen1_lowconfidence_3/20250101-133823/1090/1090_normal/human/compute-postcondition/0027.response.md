Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`
- `len(str)` is at least 1
- `j` is 1 increased by 1
- `k` is `min(k, arr[ord(str[0]) - ord('a')])`
- `i` is at least 1
- `maxSubLen` is 1
- `t` is 0
- `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```
while j <= k and i - j >= 0:
```

### Analysis of the Loop Condition
For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions inside the while loop need to be true:
1. `j <= k`
2. `i - j >= 0`

### Current States
- `j` is 1 increased by 1 (let's assume it's `j = 2` for simplicity)
- `k` is `min(k, arr[ord(str[0]) - ord('a')])`
- `i` is at least 1 (let's assume it's `i = 3` for simplicity)

Given these values:
- `j = 2`
- `i = 3`
- `i - j = 3 - 2 = 1`, which is >= 0

Since `j = 2` and `k` could be any value, let's consider the critical point where the loop will stop executing. The loop will stop when `j > k` or `i - j < 0`.

### Conditions to Ensure One More Execution
To ensure the loop executes one more time:
1. We need to make sure `j` is still less than or equal to `k`.
2. We need to ensure `i - j` remains non-negative.

### Adjusting the States
- `j` must be such that `j <= k`.
- `i` must be such that `i - j >= 0`.

Since `j` is already incremented by 1 (let's say `j = 2`), we need to ensure that `k` is at least 2. Also, since `i` is at least 1, we need to ensure `i` is at least 2 to keep `i - j` non-negative.

### Final Adjusted States
State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `len(str)` is at least 1, `j` must be at least 2, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is at least 1, `maxSubLen` is 1, `t` is 0, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`**

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `len(str)` is at least 1, `j` must be at least 2, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is at least 1, `maxSubLen` is 1, `t` is 0, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`**
