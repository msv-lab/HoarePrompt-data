`t` is assigned the value `i - j - 1`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `dp[i]` are updated according to the previous operations, but the exact values of these variables are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we only know that `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, and the other variables follow their respective updates.

Output State: **`maxSubLen` is the maximum of `j_prev + 1` and `maxSubLen`; `j` is `j + 1`; `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`; `t` is `i - j - 1`.**
