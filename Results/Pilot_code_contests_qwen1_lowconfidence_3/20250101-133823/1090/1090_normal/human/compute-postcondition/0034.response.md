`j` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `j` is now one more than its original value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `len(str)` is at least 1, `j` is increased by 1, `k` is the minimum of its original value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`, `i` is at least 1, `maxSubLen` is `j`, `t` is `i - j - 1` if `i - j - 1` is greater than 0, else 0, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`, `lastMatch[i - j]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.**
