The given line of code `maxSubLen = max(j, maxSubLen)` updates the value of `maxSubLen` based on the maximum of `j` and `maxSubLen`. However, without knowing the current values of `maxSubLen` and `j`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `maxSubLen`. But we know that `maxSubLen` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `j`.

Output State: **`maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `j`; `j` retains its original value.**
