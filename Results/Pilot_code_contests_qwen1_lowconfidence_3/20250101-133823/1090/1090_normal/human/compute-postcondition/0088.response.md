The code `t = t if t > 0 else 0` checks if `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is greater than 0, `t` remains unchanged. If `t` is not greater than 0 (i.e., `t` is 0 or less), `t` is set to 0. 

Given the initial state:
- `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`.
- `maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `j`.
- `j` retains its original value.
- `t` is `i - j - 1`.

Since the code only modifies `t` based on its condition, the values of `dp[i]`, `maxSubLen`, `j`, and the relationship between `t` and `i`, `j` remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state is:

**`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `j`, `j` retains its original value, `t` is `i - j - 1` if `i - j - 1 > 0` else `0`, `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.**
