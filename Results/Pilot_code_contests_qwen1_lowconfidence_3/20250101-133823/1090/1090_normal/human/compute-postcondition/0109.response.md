`lastIndex` is reassigned the value of `lastMatch[lastIndex]`. This means that `lastIndex` now holds the value that was previously stored in `lastMatch` at the index specified by the current `lastIndex`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is the final value calculated by the loop operations, `j` is `i + 1`, `k` is the minimum value it was updated to during the loop iterations, `maxSubLen` is the maximum value of `j` during the loop iterations, `t` is `0` if `i - j - 1` is 0 or less, otherwise `t` is `i - j - 1`, `lastMatch` contains the maximum values it was updated to during the loop iterations, `arr`, `MOD`, `n`, `s`, `str`, `lastStrIndex` is `len(str) - 1`, `maxSubLen`, `dp[0]`, and `lastIndex` must be less than `len(str) - 1`, `subNum` is `subNum + 1`, and `lastIndex` is equal to the value stored in `lastMatch` at its own index**.
