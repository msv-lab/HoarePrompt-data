The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. The other variables (`maxSubLen`, `dp[i]`, `t`, `lastMatch[t + 1]`, `k`, `arr`, `str`, `MOD`, and `ord`) are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`maxSubLen` is the maximum of `j_prev + 1` and `maxSubLen`; `j` is `j + 1`; `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`; `t` is `i - j - 1`; `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`; `t` is `t if t > 0 else 0`; `k` is the minimum of its original value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`; `j` is incremented by 1.**
