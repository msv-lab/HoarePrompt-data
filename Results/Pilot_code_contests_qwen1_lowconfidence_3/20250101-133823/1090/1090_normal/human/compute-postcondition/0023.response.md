The code updates the value of `lastMatch[t + 1]` to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`. Since `t` is defined as `i - j - 1` and `j` is 1, we can simplify `t` to `i - 2`. Thus, `lastMatch[t + 1]` translates to `lastMatch[i - 1]`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`
- `len(str)` is at least 1
- `j` is 1
- `k` is at least 1
- `i` is at least 1
- `maxSubLen` is 1
- `t` is `i - j - 1`

After the code execution, the only change is to `lastMatch[i - 1]`, which is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `len(str)` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, `maxSubLen` is 1, `t` is `i - 2`, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.**
