The code snippet updates the value of `k` to the minimum between the current value of `k` and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. 

Let's break it down:

- `k` is updated to `min(k, arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')])`.
- The value of `k` is now the smaller of its original value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`.
- No other variables are directly impacted.

Therefore, the Output State is: `maxSubLen` is the maximum of `j_prev + 1` and `maxSubLen`; `j` is `j + 1`; `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`; `t` is `i - j - 1`; `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`; `t` is `t if t > 0 else 0`; `k` is the minimum of its original value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`.

Output State: **`maxSubLen` is the maximum of `j_prev + 1` and `maxSubLen`; `j` is `j + 1`; `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`; `t` is `i - j - 1`; `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`; `t` is `t if t > 0 else 0`; `k` is the minimum of its original value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`.**
