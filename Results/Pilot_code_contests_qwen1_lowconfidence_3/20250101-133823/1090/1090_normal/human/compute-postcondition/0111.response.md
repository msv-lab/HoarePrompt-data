Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while lastIndex != lastStrIndex:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Initial States
- `dp[i]` is the final value calculated by the loop operations.
- `j` is `i + 1`.
- `k` is the minimum value it was updated to during the loop iterations.
- `maxSubLen` is the maximum value of `j` during the loop iterations.
- `t` is `0` if `i - j - 1` is 0 or less, otherwise `t` is `i - j - 1`.
- `lastMatch` contains the maximum values it was updated to during the loop iterations.
- `arr`, `MOD`, `n`, `s`, `str`, `lastStrIndex` is `len(str) - 1`.
- `maxSubLen`, `dp[0]`, and `lastIndex` must be less than `len(str) - 1`.
- `subNum` is `subNum + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `lastIndex != lastStrIndex`.
2. **Initial States**:
   - `lastIndex` must be less than `len(str) - 1`.
   - `lastStrIndex` is `len(str) - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `lastIndex` must be incremented by 1 (because `lastIndex` must be less than `lastStrIndex` initially, and the loop increments `lastIndex` until it equals `lastStrIndex`).

### Required Adjustments
- To ensure the loop executes one more time, `lastIndex` must be less than `lastStrIndex` (which is `len(str) - 1`).
- Since `lastStrIndex` is fixed, we need to adjust `lastIndex` such that it is still within the bounds but can be incremented to reach `lastStrIndex`.

### Final Answer
State: **`dp[i]` is the final value calculated by the loop operations, `j` is `i + 1`, `k` is the minimum value it was updated to during the loop iterations, `maxSubLen` is the maximum value of `j` during the loop iterations, `t` is `0` if `i - j - 1` is 0 or less, otherwise `t` is `i - j - 1`, `lastMatch` contains the maximum values it was updated to during the loop iterations, `arr`, `MOD`, `n`, `s`, `str`, `lastStrIndex` is `len(str) - 1`, `maxSubLen`, `dp[0]`, and `lastIndex` must be less than `len(str) - 1` and `lastIndex` must be incremented to be equal to `lastStrIndex` before the loop exits.**

Thus, the state should be:
State: **`dp[i]` is the final value calculated by the loop operations, `j` is `i + 1`, `k` is the minimum value it was updated to during the loop iterations, `maxSubLen` is the maximum value of `j` during the loop iterations, `t` is `0` if `i - j - 1` is 0 or less, otherwise `t` is `i - j - 1`, `lastMatch` contains the maximum values it was updated to during the loop iterations, `arr`, `MOD`, `n`, `s`, `str`, `lastStrIndex` is `len(str) - 1`, `maxSubLen`, `dp[0]`, and `lastIndex` must be less than `len(str) - 1` and `lastIndex` must be equal to `lastStrIndex` for the loop to exit.**
