`t` is assigned the value `i - j - 1`. The value of `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, and `maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `j`. The value of `j` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to (dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD, `maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `j`, `j` retains its original value, `t` is `i - j - 1`.**
