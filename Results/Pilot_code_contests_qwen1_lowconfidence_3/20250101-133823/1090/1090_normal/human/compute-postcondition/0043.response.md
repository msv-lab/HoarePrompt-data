Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to the final value calculated by iterating through the loop, `len(str)` is at least 1, `j` is the final value after all iterations, `k` is the final value after all iterations, `i` is at least 1, `maxSubLen` is the maximum value of `j` during the loop iterations, `t` is `i - j - 1` if `i - j - 1` is greater than 0, else 0, `lastMatch[t + 1]` and `lastMatch[i - j]` are the maximum values they were updated to during the loop iterations, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum value it was updated to during the loop iterations, `arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]` is the initial value used to assign `k`.**
