The code assigns the value of `arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]` to the variable `k`. Given that `str[i - 1]` is a character in the string `str` and `ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')` calculates the index of this character in the alphabet (considering 'a' as 0), the value of `k` will be determined by the value at that index in the array `arr`.

Since the initial state does not provide the actual values of `arr`, we can't determine the exact value of `k`. However, we know that `k` is now assigned the value from `arr` based on the character `str[i - 1]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `maxSubLen` is the maximum length of the valid substring found during the loop iterations, `dp[i]` is the final value calculated by the loop, `t` is 0, `lastMatch[t + 1]` is the maximum value it was updated to during the loop iterations, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum value it was updated to during the loop iterations, `k` is `arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]`**
