The code updates the value of `dp[i]` to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `maxSubLen` is the maximum of `j` and `maxSubLen`.
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`.
- `t` is updated to `i - j - 1`.
- `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.
- `t` is updated to `t if t > 0 else 0`.
- `k` is updated to the minimum of its original value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`.
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `k` must be at least `j + 1`.
- `i` must be such that `i - (j + 1) >= 0`.

Given these impacts, the Output State is:

Output State: **`maxSubLen` is the maximum of `j` and `maxSubLen`; `j` is `j + 1`; `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`; `t` is updated to `i - j - 1`; `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`; `t` is updated to `t if t > 0 else 0`; `k` is updated to the minimum of its original value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`; `j` is incremented by 1; `k` must be at least `j + 1`; `i` must be such that `i - (j + 1) >= 0`.**
