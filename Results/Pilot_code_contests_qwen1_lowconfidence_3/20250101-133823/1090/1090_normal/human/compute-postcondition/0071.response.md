Output State: **`j` is equal to `len(str) + 1`, `maxSubLen` is the maximum length of the valid substring found during the loop iterations, `dp[i]` is the final value calculated by the loop, `t` is 0, `lastMatch[t + 1]` is the maximum value it was updated to during the loop iterations, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum value it was updated to during the loop iterations, `k` is the minimum value it was updated to during the loop iterations, and the condition `j <= k and i - j >= 0` must hold true for the loop to execute at least once.**
