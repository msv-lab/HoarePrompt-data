Output State: **`maxSubLen` is the maximum of `j` and `maxSubLen`; `j` is `j + 1`; `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`; `t` is `t if t > 0 else 0`; `lastMatch[t + 1]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`; `t` is `t if t > 0 else 0`; `k` is updated to the minimum of its original value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`; `j` is incremented by 1; `k` must be at least `j + 1`; `i` must be such that `i - (j + 1) >= 0`. `k` is updated to the minimum of `k` and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`**.
