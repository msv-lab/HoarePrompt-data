The code updates `maxSubLen` to the maximum of `j` and `maxSubLen`. Given that `j` is 1 and `maxSubLen` is the maximum value of `j` during the loop iterations, `maxSubLen` could have been updated to a value that is at least 1. However, without knowing the exact value of `maxSubLen` before this line of code, we know that `maxSubLen` will be the maximum of its current value (which is at least 1) and `j` (which is 1). Therefore, `maxSubLen` will remain at least 1.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to the final value calculated by iterating through the loop, `len(str)` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `i` is `len(str) + 1`, `maxSubLen` is at least 1, `t` is `len(str) - j` if `len(str) - j` is greater than 0, else 0, `lastMatch[t + 1]` and `lastMatch[i - j]` are the maximum values they were updated to during the loop iterations, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum value it was updated to during the loop iterations, `arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]` is the initial value used to assign `k`.**
