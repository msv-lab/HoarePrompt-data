Let's break down the conditions for the loop to execute at least once:

The loop condition is:
```
while j <= k and i - j >= 0:
```

Given the current state before the loop:
- `j` is 1
- `k` is `arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]`
- `i` is `len(str) + 1`

We need to check the loop condition:
1. `j <= k`: Since `j` is 1, this part depends on the value of `k`.
2. `i - j >= 0`: Given `i = len(str) + 1` and `j = 1`, `i - j` is `len(str)`, which is always greater than or equal to 0 because `len(str) >= 0`.

So, the only condition that needs to be checked is `j <= k`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need `k` to be at least 1. The current state doesn't provide information about `k`, but since `k` is derived from `arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]` and `str[i - 1]` is a valid character in `str`, `k` should generally be set appropriately.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring `k` is at least 1.

State: **`dp[i]` is updated to the final value calculated by iterating through the loop, `len(str)` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `i` is `len(str) + 1`, `maxSubLen` is the maximum value of `j` during the loop iterations, `t` is `len(str) - j` if `len(str) - j` is greater than 0, else 0, `lastMatch[t + 1]` and `lastMatch[i - j]` are the maximum values they were updated to during the loop iterations, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum value it was updated to during the loop iterations, `arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]` is the initial value used to assign `k`.**
