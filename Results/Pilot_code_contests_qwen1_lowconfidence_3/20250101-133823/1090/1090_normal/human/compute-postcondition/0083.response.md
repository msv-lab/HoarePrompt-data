To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```
while j <= k and i - j >= 0:
```

### Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `j` is 2
- `k` is `min(k, arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')])`
- `i` must be at least 1
- `maxSubLen` is 1
- `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - 1]) % MOD`
- `t` is 0
- `lastMatch[i - 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition Breakdown:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j <= k` and `i - j >= 0`.
   - We need to ensure that both conditions hold true for the next iteration.

2. **Condition 1: `j <= k`**
   - Currently, `j` is 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `k` must be greater than or equal to `j` (which is 2).
   - Therefore, we need to adjust `k` to ensure `k >= 2`.

3. **Condition 2: `i - j >= 0`**
   - `i` must be at least 1 (given in the problem statement).
   - Since `j` is 2, `i` must be at least 3 to satisfy `i - j >= 0`.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to ensure `i >= 3`.

### Adjusted States
- `j` is 2 (no change needed as we only need to ensure the loop condition holds).
- `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` must be at least 3.

### Final State Adjustment
The final state adjustment ensures that the loop can execute one more time based on the conditions given.

**State:**
**`j` is 2, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` must be at least 3, `maxSubLen` is 1, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - 1]) % MOD`, `t` is 0, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`**
