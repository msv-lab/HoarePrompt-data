To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `j <= k and i - j >= 0`.

Given the current state right before the loop:
- `j` is 1
- `maxSubLen` is the maximum length of the valid substring found during the loop iterations (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `dp[i]` is the final value calculated by the loop (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `t` is 0
- `lastMatch[t + 1]` is the maximum value it was updated to during the loop iterations (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum value it was updated to during the loop iterations (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `k` is `arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]`

Let's break down the loop condition:

1. **Condition 1: `j <= k`**
   - Currently, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to proceed, `1 <= k` must be true.
   - This means `k` must be at least 1.

2. **Condition 2: `i - j >= 0`**
   - Given `j` is 1, this becomes `i - 1 >= 0`.
   - Simplifying, we get `i >= 1`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `k` must be at least 1.
- `i` must be at least 1.

The other states (`maxSubLen`, `dp[i]`, `t`, `lastMatch[t + 1]`, `lastMatch[i - 1]`) do not affect the loop condition directly and do not need adjustment.

Therefore, the required adjustments are:
State: **`j` is 1, `k` must be at least 1, `i` must be at least 1**
