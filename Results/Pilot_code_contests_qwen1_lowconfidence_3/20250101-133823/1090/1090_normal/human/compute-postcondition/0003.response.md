The code snippet `arr = map(eval, arr)` will convert each element in the list `arr` to its corresponding evaluated value using the `eval` function. Since `arr` was originally a list of strings, each string in `arr` will be evaluated as a Python expression.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters
- `str` is a string (the input from the user)
- `arr` is a list of strings obtained from splitting `raw_input()`

After the code `arr = map(eval, arr)` is executed, each string in `arr` will be converted to its evaluated form. However, without knowing the specific contents of `arr`, we cannot determine the exact values after evaluation. But we can state that each string in `arr` has been evaluated.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters, `str` is a string (the input from the user), `arr` is a list of evaluated expressions**
