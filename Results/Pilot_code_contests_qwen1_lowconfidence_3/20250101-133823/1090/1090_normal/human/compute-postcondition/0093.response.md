The given code snippet updates `dp[i]` to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`. This operation affects the value of `dp[i]`, but the initial values of other variables such as `k`, `maxSubLen`, `j`, `t`, and `lastMatch[t + 1]` remain unchanged unless they are directly assigned new values in this code snippet.

Since the code only updates `dp[i]` and does not assign new values to `k`, `maxSubLen`, `j`, `t`, and `lastMatch[t + 1]`, these variables retain their initial states from the precondition.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`k` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of `j` and its current value and `maxSubLen`, `j` is increased by 1, `t` is `i - j - 1` if `i - j - 1 > 0` else `0`, `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`, `j` is less than or equal to `k` and less than `i`**
