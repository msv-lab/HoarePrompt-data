The code updates `maxSubLen` to be the maximum of `j` and the current value of `maxSubLen`. The value of `maxSubLen` will be updated to ensure it is at least `j` since `j` is increased by 1 and `k` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1`. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Given the precondition that `maxSubLen` is initially `j`, and considering that `j` is increased by 1, the new value of `maxSubLen` will be the maximum of the new `j` and the old `maxSubLen`.

Since `j` is increased by 1, let's denote the new value of `j` as `j_new`. Therefore, `maxSubLen` will be updated to `max(j_new, maxSubLen)`. Given that `maxSubLen` was previously `j`, and now `j` is `j_new = j + 1`, the new value of `maxSubLen` will be `max(j + 1, maxSubLen)`.

The states of the other variables (`dp[i]`, `len(str)`, `k`, `i`, `t`, `lastMatch[i - 1]`, `lastMatch[i - j]`) are not affected.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `len(str)` is at least 1, `j` is increased by 1, `k` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1`, `i` is at least 1, `maxSubLen` is `max(j + 1, maxSubLen)`, `t` is `i - j - 1` if `i - j - 1` is greater than 0, else 0, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`, `lastMatch[i - j]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`**
