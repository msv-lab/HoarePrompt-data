The code `t = t if t > 0 else 0` does not actually change the value of `t` because the value of `t` is already set to `t if t > 0 else 0`. This means that `t` remains unchanged from its previous value. All other variables remain unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `len(str)` is at least 1, `j` is increased by 1, `k` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1`, `i` is at least 1, `maxSubLen` is `max(j + 1, maxSubLen)`, `t` is `i - j - 1` if `i - j - 1` is greater than 0, else 0, `lastMatch[t + 1]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.**
