`t` is assigned the value of `i - j - 1`. The value of `i` is at least 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `i - j - 1` is calculated. If `i - j - 1` is greater than 0, `t` is assigned `i - j - 1`, otherwise, `t` is assigned 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `len(str)` is at least 1, `j` is increased by 1, `k` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1`, `i` is at least 1, `maxSubLen` is `max(j + 1, maxSubLen)`, `t` is `i - j - 1` if `i - j - 1` is greater than 0, else 0, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`, `lastMatch[i - j]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`**
