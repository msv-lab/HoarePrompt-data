The code updates `lastMatch[t + 1]` to be the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`. The other variables (`dp[i]`, `maxSubLen`, `j`, and `t`) are not directly affected by this line of code.

- `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`.
- `maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `j`.
- `j` retains its original value.
- `t` is `i - j - 1`.

The variable `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `j`, `j` retains its original value, `t` is `i - j - 1`, `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.**
