The code `arr = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns it to `arr`. The initial state of `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters. The value of `str` remains unchanged as it is the input from the user.

After executing the code, `n`, `s`, and `str` remain as per their initial conditions, but a new variable `arr` is introduced which contains the split input from the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters; `str` is a string (the input from the user); `arr` is a list of strings obtained from splitting `raw_input()`**
