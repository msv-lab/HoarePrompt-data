`t` is assigned the value `i - j - 1`. The value of `i`, `j`, and `MOD` remain unchanged from the initial state. The states of other variables such as `dp`, `len(str)`, `k`, `maxSubLen`, `t`, and `lastMatch` are updated according to the assignment.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `len(str)` is at least 1, `j` must be at least 2, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is at least 1, `maxSubLen` is `j`, `t` is `i - j - 1`, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`**
