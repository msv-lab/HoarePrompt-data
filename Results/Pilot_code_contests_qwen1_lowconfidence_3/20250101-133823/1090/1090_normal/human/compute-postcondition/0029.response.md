`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`. This means the value of `dp[i]` is now `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `len(str)` is at least 1, `j` must be at least 2, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is at least 1, `maxSubLen` is `j`, `t` is 0, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`**
