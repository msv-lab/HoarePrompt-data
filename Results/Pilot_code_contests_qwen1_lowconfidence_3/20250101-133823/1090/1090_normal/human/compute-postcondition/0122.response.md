The given code snippet is a print statement that outputs three values separated by newlines: `dp[len(str)]`, `maxSubLen`, and `subNum`. 

- `dp[len(str)]` refers to the final value of `dp[i]` where `i` is `len(str)`.
- `maxSubLen` remains unchanged as it is already computed and stored in the variable.
- `subNum` also remains unchanged as it is already computed and stored in the variable.

No new variables are assigned or modified within this snippet. Therefore, the only changes are the output of the three values mentioned above.

Output State: **`dp[len(str)]` is the final value calculated by the loop operations, `maxSubLen` is the maximum value of `j` during the loop iterations, `subNum` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed.**
