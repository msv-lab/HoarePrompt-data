`t` is assigned the value of `i - j - 1`. Given the initial state where `j` is 1, `i` must be at least 1, and `j` is 1, the value of `t` will be `i - 1 - 1 = i - 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 1, `k` must be at least 1, `i` must be at least 1, `maxSubLen` is 1, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - 1]) % MOD`, `t` is `i - 2`.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `k` must be at least 1, `i` must be at least 1, `maxSubLen` is 1, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - 1]) % MOD`, `t` is `i - 2`**
