`maxSubLen` is assigned the maximum value between `j` and `maxSubLen`. Initially, `j` is 1 and `k` must be at least 1, `i` must be at least 1. Since the value of `maxSubLen` is not specified in the initial state, we assume it could be any value. However, after the assignment, `maxSubLen` will take the maximum value between its current value (which we assume to be less than or equal to 1 for the sake of this example) and `j`, which is 1. Therefore, `maxSubLen` will be 1.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `k` must be at least 1, `i` must be at least 1, `maxSubLen` is 1**
