The code updates the value of `t` using a conditional statement. It checks if `t` is greater than 0, and if true, it keeps `t` as it is; otherwise, it sets `t` to 0. Since `t` is defined as `i - j - 1`, we need to consider the condition under which `t` might become 0.

- If `i - j - 1` is greater than 0, then `t` remains `i - j - 1`.
- If `i - j - 1` is less than or equal to 0, then `t` is set to 0.

Given the initial conditions:
- `j` must be at least 2
- `i` is at least 1
- Therefore, the minimum value of `i - j - 1` is `-1` (when `i = 1` and `j = 2`), making `t` 0 in this case.

The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `len(str)` is at least 1, `j` must be at least 2, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is at least 1, `maxSubLen` is `j`, `t` is `i - j - 1` if `i - j - 1` is greater than 0, else 0, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`, `lastMatch[i - j]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.**
