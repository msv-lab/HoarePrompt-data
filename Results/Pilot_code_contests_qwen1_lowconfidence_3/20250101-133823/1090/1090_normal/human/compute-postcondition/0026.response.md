The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `len(str)` is at least 1, `j` is 1 increased by 1, `k` is `min(k, arr[ord(str[0]) - ord('a')])`, `i` is at least 1, `maxSubLen` is 1, `t` is 0, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.**
