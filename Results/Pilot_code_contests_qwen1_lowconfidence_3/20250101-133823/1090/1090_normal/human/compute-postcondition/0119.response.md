The code `lastIndex = lastMatch[lastIndex]` updates the value of `lastIndex` to the value stored in `lastMatch` at the index `lastIndex`. Since the value of `lastIndex` before the assignment is less than `len(str) - 1` (precondition), and `lastMatch` contains the maximum values it was updated to during the loop iterations, the new value of `lastIndex` will be a value that was previously stored in `lastMatch`.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is the final value calculated by the loop operations, `j` is `i + 1`, `k` is the minimum value it was updated to during the loop iterations, `maxSubLen` is the maximum value of `j` during the loop iterations, `t` is `0` if `i - j - 1` is 0 or less, otherwise `t` is `i - j - 1`, `lastMatch` contains the maximum values it was updated to during the loop iterations, `arr`, `MOD`, `n`, `s`, `str`, `lastStrIndex` is `len(str) - 1`, `maxSubLen`, `dp[0]`, and `lastIndex` is updated to the value in `lastMatch` at the index `lastIndex`, and `subNum` is incremented by 1.**
