Let's break down the conditions of the `while` loop and the given states to determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Given:
- The loop condition is `j <= k and i - j >= 0`.
- `len(str)` is at least 1.
- `j` is 1.
- `k` is assigned the value `arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: `j <= k and i - j >= 0`
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both parts of the condition need to be true.
   - The first part `j <= k` requires `j` to be less than or equal to `k`.
   - The second part `i - j >= 0` requires `i` to be greater than or equal to `j`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `len(str)` is at least 1.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `k` is assigned the value `arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `j` is already 1, we need to ensure `j <= k` holds true. This means `k` must be at least 1 (since `j` is 1).
   - We also need to ensure `i - j >= 0`, which simplifies to `i - 1 >= 0` because `j` is 1. Therefore, `i` must be at least 1.

4. **Combining Conditions**:
   - `len(str) >= 1` is already satisfied.
   - `k` must be at least 1.
   - `i` must be at least 1.

### Final State Adjustment:

The current state is:
- `len(str)` is at least 1.
- `j` is 1.
- `k` is assigned the value `arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust:
- `k` must be at least 1.
- `i` must be at least 1.

Thus, the final state should be:

State: **`len(str)` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, and `i` is at least 1**
