The code updates the variable `k` to the value of `arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]`. Here, `str[i - 1]` refers to the character at index `i - 1` in the string `str`, and `arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]` is the initial value used to assign `k`.

The previous state of `k` was the final value calculated after all iterations, which is `k`. After executing the code, `k` is reassigned to the value of `arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to the final value calculated by iterating through the loop, `len(str)` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is now `arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]`, `i` is `len(str) + 1`, `maxSubLen` is the maximum value of `j` during the loop iterations, `t` is `len(str) - j` if `len(str) - j` is greater than 0, else 0, `lastMatch[t + 1]` and `lastMatch[i - j]` are the maximum values they were updated to during the loop iterations, `lastMatch[i - 1]` is the maximum value it was updated to during the loop iterations, `arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]` is the initial value used to assign `k`.**
