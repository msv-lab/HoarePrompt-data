Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State**: 
   - `j` is increased by 1.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `j <= k and i - j >= 0`.

3. **Analyzing the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both parts of the condition must be true:
     - `j <= k`
     - `i - j >= 0`

4. **Condition Analysis**:
   - After the previous iteration, `j` has been increased by 1.
   - Letâ€™s denote the previous value of `j` as `j_prev`. So, `j = j_prev + 1`.
   - The condition `j <= k` means that `j_prev + 1 <= k`, which simplifies to `j_prev <= k - 1`.
   - The condition `i - j >= 0` means that `i - (j_prev + 1) >= 0`, which simplifies to `i - j_prev - 1 >= 0` or `i - j_prev >= 1`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still satisfy `j <= k` and `i - j >= 0`.
   - Since `j` is now `j_prev + 1`, we need to ensure that `j_prev` is such that `j_prev <= k - 1` and `i - j_prev >= 1`.
   - Therefore, `j_prev` must be in the range where both conditions hold true.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The state after the previous iteration (`j` is increased by 1) already satisfies the condition for the next iteration as long as `j_prev` was within the correct range.
   - There is no need to adjust any additional states beyond ensuring that `j_prev` was valid.

Therefore, the state remains the same as given, but we must confirm that the previous value of `j` (denoted as `j_prev`) was within the required range.

**State**: **`j` is increased by 1**
