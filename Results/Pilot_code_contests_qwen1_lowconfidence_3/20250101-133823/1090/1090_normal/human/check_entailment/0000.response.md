Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program uses `input()` and `raw_input()` functions which are not standard Python 3 functions. Instead, it should use `int(input())` for reading integers and `input().strip()` for reading strings. However, the main issue here is that the program does not properly handle the input types and lengths as specified.

2. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The dynamic programming logic used in the program is incorrect. It attempts to count the number of ways to split the string based on the constraints, but it does not correctly implement the logic to ensure substrings do not exceed the allowed lengths for each character.

3. **Variable Naming and Initialization**: The variable names and initializations are not consistent with the problem description. For example, `arr` should be initialized to store the maximum lengths for each character, but the program does not properly update these values based on the input.

4. **Calculation of Maximum Substring Length**: The logic to calculate the maximum substring length (`maxSubLen`) is flawed. The program updates `maxSubLen` based on the current position `i` and the length `j`, but it does not correctly account for the constraints of the magical paper.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    MOD = 1000000007
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    max_sub_len = 0
    last_match = [0] * (n + 1)

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        j = 1
        k = a[ord(s[i - 1]) - ord('a')]
        while j <= k and i - j >= 0:
            max_sub_len = max(j, max_sub_len)
            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD
            t = i - j - 1
            last_match[t + 1] = max(last_match[t + 1], i - 1)
            j += 1

    last_index = 0
    sub_num = 0
    while last_index < n:
        sub_num += 1
        if last_index == last_match[last_index]:
            last_index += 1
        else:
            last_index = last_match[last_index]

    print(dp[n], max_sub_len, sub_num, sep='\n')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly handles the input, implements the dynamic programming logic to count the number of valid splits, and calculates the maximum substring length and minimum number of substrings.
