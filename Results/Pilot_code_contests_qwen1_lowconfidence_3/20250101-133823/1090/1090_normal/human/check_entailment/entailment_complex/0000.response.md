Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program follows the problem description:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the input as expected. `n` is read as an integer, `s` as a string, and `arr` as a list of integers representing the maximum allowed lengths for each character.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a DP array `dp` with size 3200 (more than sufficient for the problem constraints) and sets `dp[0]` to 1, indicating one way to form an empty substring.
   - `lastMatch` is initialized to store the last position where each prefix of the string could end a valid substring.

3. **DP Array Update**:
   - The main loop iterates over the string `s`. For each character, it updates the DP array and `lastMatch` to ensure that the substring conditions are met.
   - The variable `k` stores the current maximum allowed length for the current character.
   - The inner loop checks for valid substrings ending at the current position and updates the DP array accordingly.

4. **Tracking Maximum Substring Length**:
   - During the DP array update, the maximum length of valid substrings (`maxSubLen`) is tracked.

5. **Counting Minimum Number of Substrings**:
   - After the DP array is fully computed, the program determines the minimum number of substrings needed by using the `lastMatch` array to find the last positions where valid substrings end.

6. **Output Calculation**:
   - Finally, the program prints the number of ways to split the string (`dp[len(s)]`), the maximum length of a valid substring (`maxSubLen`), and the minimum number of substrings (`subNum`).

Given that the program follows the exact steps described in the problem statement and handles all necessary aspects (input reading, DP array computation, maximum substring length tracking, and output calculation), it correctly implements the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
