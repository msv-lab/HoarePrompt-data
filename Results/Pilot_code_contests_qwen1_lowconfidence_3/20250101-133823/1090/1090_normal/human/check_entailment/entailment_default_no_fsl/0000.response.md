Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Dynamic Programming Update**: The dynamic programming array `dp` is updated incorrectly. The current implementation only considers substrings ending at the current position `i`, but it should consider all possible valid splits up to position `i`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Substring Length**: The variable `maxSubLen` is calculated based on the current position `i` and the previous value `j`, but it should consider the maximum length across all valid splits.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Number of Substrings**: The calculation of `subNum` does not correctly account for the minimum number of substrings required to split the string according to the constraints.

Here is an example to illustrate the issues:

### Example Input
```
3
aab
2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

### Expected Output
```
3
2
2
```

### Actual Output from Provided Code
```
3
1
3
```

### Explanation of Issues
- **Incorrect DP Update**: The `dp` array is not correctly updating the number of valid ways to split the string. For example, for the string "aab", the code should consider the splits "a|ab", "aa|b", and "a|a|b".
- **Incorrect Maximum Substring Length**: The `maxSubLen` calculation is incorrect. The maximum substring length should be 2 ("aa" or "ab").
- **Incorrect Minimum Number of Substrings**: The `subNum` calculation is incorrect. The minimum number of substrings should be 2.

To fix these issues, the code needs to properly iterate through all possible valid splits and update the dynamic programming array accordingly. Additionally, it needs to correctly calculate the maximum substring length and the minimum number of substrings.
