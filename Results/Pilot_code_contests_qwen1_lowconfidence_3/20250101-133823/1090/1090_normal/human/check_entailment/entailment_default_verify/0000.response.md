Final: **True**

Reasoning:
Based on the provided output hints and the analysis of the code, the program now correctly processes the input string and the list of integers representing the maximum lengths for each character. It uses dynamic programming to count the number of valid ways to split the string, find the maximum length of a valid substring, and determine the minimum number of substrings needed. The logic for updating the dynamic programming array `dp` and tracking the last occurrence of valid substrings in `lastMatch` appears to be implemented correctly. The program also correctly counts the number of distinct valid substrings and prints the required outputs.

Given that the output hints align with the problem description and the provided code seems to address all the necessary steps to solve the problem correctly, the original assessment of the program being incorrect is no longer valid. Therefore, the final assessment is that the program is correct.
