The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of rows), `m` (the number of columns), and `num` (the value to fill the 2D list). It returns a 2D list of size `n x m`, where every element in the list is equal to `num`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the code itself, but it handles the general case of creating a rectangular 2D list filled with a specified value. No missing functionality is noted in the provided code.
