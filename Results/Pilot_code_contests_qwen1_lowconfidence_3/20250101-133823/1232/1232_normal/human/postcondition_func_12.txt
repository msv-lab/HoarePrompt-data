The function `func_13` takes three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `p` are integers, and `y` is an integer representing the exponent. The function computes `(x^y) % p` using an efficient method known as modular exponentiation. Specifically, it updates `res` to the result of the expression `res * x^(y & 1) % p` after each iteration of the loop, where `res` is initialized to 1. The function iterates through the bits of `y` (from least significant to most significant), squaring `x` and reducing it modulo `p` at each step, and multiplying `res` by `x` if the current bit of `y` is 1. After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `res`, which is equivalent to `(x^y) % p`. Potential edge cases include when `y` is 0, in which case the function effectively returns `res`, which is 1, since no multiplications are performed. If `p` is 1, the result is always 0 regardless of `x` and `y`. The function also handles negative exponents by ensuring `x` is reduced modulo `p` before the loop starts.
