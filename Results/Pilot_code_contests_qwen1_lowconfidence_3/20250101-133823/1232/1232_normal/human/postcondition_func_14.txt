The function `func_15` accepts an integer `n` representing the number of columns in a Young diagram. It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, less than or equal to 3 and not 2, or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. Additionally, it returns `False` if `n` has any divisors other than 1 and itself within the range up to the square root of `n`. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns `True`. The function checks specific divisibility rules and the primality of `n` by checking for divisors up to the square root of `n`, skipping even numbers and multiples of 3.
