Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code in `func_17` calculates two sums, `w` and `b`, based on the input list `a` and then passes the minimum of these two sums to `func_18`. However, the logic for calculating `w` and `b` does not correctly account for the maximum number of non-overlapping dominos that can be placed in the Young diagram.

The correct approach to solve this problem involves a more sophisticated algorithm that maximizes the number of dominos placed horizontally and vertically. The current implementation only considers placing dominos in a checkerboard pattern, which may not yield the maximum number of dominos.

A correct solution would involve iterating through the columns and deciding the best way to place dominos based on the remaining height of the columns. For example, one common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that prioritizes placing dominos horizontally first and then vertically if necessary.

Here is a simplified version of what a correct solution might look like:

```python
def func_17():
    n = func_1()
    a = func_5()
    
    total_dominos = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] >= 2:
            a[i] -= 2
            total_dominos += 1
        elif a[i] == 1 and i + 1 < n and a[i + 1] >= 1:
            a[i + 1] -= 1
            total_dominos += 1
    
    func_18(total_dominos)
```

This code attempts to place as many horizontal dominos as possible first and then fills any gaps with vertical dominos. However, the actual implementation would need to handle all edge cases and ensure the maximum number of dominos is placed.

Since the given code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the number of non-overlapping dominos, the program is incorrect.
