The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `l`, which is a list of non-negative integers sorted in non-increasing order. It returns a new list that is sorted in non-decreasing order using the `getKey` function as the sorting key. Given the initial state of `l`, the function performs the following actions:

1. The function uses the built-in `sorted` function to sort the list `l`.
2. The `sorted` function sorts the list in non-decreasing order based on the key returned by the `getKey` function.
3. The function does not modify the original list `l`; instead, it returns a new sorted list.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If the `getKey` function is not defined or does not return a valid sorting key, the behavior of the function is undefined. However, the provided code does not handle this case.
- The function assumes that the `getKey` function is correctly implemented and will always return a valid sorting key for the elements in `l`.

After the function concludes, the program will have a new list that is sorted in non-decreasing order based on the key returned by the `getKey` function. The original list `l` remains unchanged.
