The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and stack size for a new thread, then starts a new thread named `thread` which targets the `main` function. The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000, and `a`, a list of `n` integers where each element is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 300,000 and a_i ≥ a_{i+1}. After starting the thread, the function does not directly manipulate or return any values from the `main` function. The final state of the program is that a new thread has been started to execute the `main` function, and the original calling thread continues its execution.
