The function `func_12` accepts an integer `n` and returns a list of its individual digits. The function converts the integer `n` into a string, iterates over each character in the string, converts each character back into an integer, and collects these integers into a list. This process works for any non-negative integer `n`. However, the function does not handle negative integers, as converting a negative integer to a string results in a string that includes a '-' sign, which would be included in the list of digits. Therefore, the function should only be used with non-negative integers. Additionally, the function does not modify the input `n` and returns a new list of digits without altering the original integer.
