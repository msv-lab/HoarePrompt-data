The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` and returns a binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix. The function directly converts the integer `n` to its binary form using the `bin()` function and then removes the '0b' prefix by replacing it with an empty string. There are no additional actions performed beyond this conversion and removal. The function handles valid inputs within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000) and correctly processes all integers within this range, including edge cases such as the smallest and largest possible values.
