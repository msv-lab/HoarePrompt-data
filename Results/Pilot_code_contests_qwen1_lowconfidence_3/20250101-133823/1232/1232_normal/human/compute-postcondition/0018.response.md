The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of `x` or `args`, nor does it change the content of `sys.stdout`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `at_start`.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `x` is now the next element in `args`, and `args` has one fewer element; sys.stdout will contain a space followed by the string representation of `x` written into the file.**
