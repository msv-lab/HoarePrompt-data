Postcondition: ***`sep` is ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` is an empty iterable; `sys.stdout` contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `\n`; the call to `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is made, and the value of `flush` remains unchanged.***
