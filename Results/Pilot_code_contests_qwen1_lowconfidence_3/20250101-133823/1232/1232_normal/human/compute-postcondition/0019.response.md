Output State: **`sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty iterable, `sys.stdout` contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `x` in `args`.
- Initially, `at_start` is `True`, but it gets set to `False` after the first iteration.
- On each iteration, if `at_start` is `False`, `sep` is written to `file`.
- `str(x)` is then written to `file`.
- After the loop completes, `at_start` will be `False` because it gets set to `False` in every iteration (and never reverts back to `True`).
- If `args` is non-empty, `file` will contain the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by `sep`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `args` is empty from the start), `at_start` will still be `False` after the condition to set it to `False` fails, but no content will be written to `file`. However, the format of the final state should reflect that `args` is empty, and no additional elements are added to `sys.stdout`.
