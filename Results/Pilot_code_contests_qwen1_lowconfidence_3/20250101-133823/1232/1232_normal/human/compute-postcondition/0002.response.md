The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of the other variables (`sep` and `file`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `True`.

Output State: **`sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `True`**
