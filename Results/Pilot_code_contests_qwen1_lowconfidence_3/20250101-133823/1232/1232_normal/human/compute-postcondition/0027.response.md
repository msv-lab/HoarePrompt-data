Functionality: **The function `func_17` accepts a parameter `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000) and a parameter `a` (a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 300,000 and `a_i` ≥ `a_{i+1}`), and processes them according to the description of a Young diagram. It calculates two sums, `w` and `b`, based on the elements of `a`. Specifically, for even indices `i`, `w` accumulates `(a[i] + 1) // 2` and `b` accumulates `a[i] // 2`, while for odd indices `i`, `w` accumulates `a[i] // 2` and `b` accumulates `(a[i] + 1) // 2`. After the loop, it calls `func_18` with the minimum of `w` and `b`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has computed these two sums based on the given rules and passed the smaller one to `func_18`.**

Edge Cases:
- If `n` is 1, the loop will not execute, and `w` and `b` will remain 0. Therefore, `func_18(min(0, 0))` will be called, which simplifies to `func_18(0)`.

Missing Functionality:
- The annotations suggest that the initial state of `n` and `a` is provided before the function call, but the actual function body does not modify `n` or `a`. Therefore, it is assumed that `n` and `a` are correctly initialized and within the specified ranges when the function is called.
