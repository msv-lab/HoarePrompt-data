The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to `file`. Given that `sep` is `' '`, this operation will write a space character to `sys.stdout`. The variables `at_start`, `args`, and `file` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`, `args` is a non-empty iterable with one fewer element, `sys.stdout` has a space written to it**
