In the provided code, two variables `sep` and `file` are assigned values from the dictionary `kwargs` using the `pop` method with default values. However, since the initial state mentions no variables are changed, we assume `kwargs` is not explicitly defined before this code, and thus, `sep` and `file` are assigned default values.

- `sep` is assigned the value `' '`, which is the default value for the `sep` parameter in the `pop` method.
- `file` is assigned the value `sys.stdout`, which is the default value for the `file` parameter in the `pop` method.

Since no variables were initially defined, their states are effectively set by this code. The other variables remain undefined as per the initial state.

Output State: **`sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`**
