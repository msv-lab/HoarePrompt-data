The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to `file`, which is `sys.stdout` in this case. Since `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` returns the value of the key 'end' from `kwargs` if it exists, or '\n' if it doesn't, and there's no mention of `kwargs` before this line, we assume `kwargs` does not contain the key 'end'. Therefore, `'\n'` is written to `sys.stdout`. The other variables (`sep`, `file`, `at_start`, `args`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty iterable, `sys.stdout` contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `\n`.**
