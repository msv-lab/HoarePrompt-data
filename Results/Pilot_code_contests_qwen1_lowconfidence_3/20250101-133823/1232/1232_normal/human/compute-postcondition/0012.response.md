The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file object `file`. Since `file` is initially set to `sys.stdout`, this will write the string representation of `x` to `sys.stdout`.

Given the initial state:
- `sep` is `' '`
- `file` is `sys.stdout`
- `at_start` is `False`
- `args` is a non-empty iterable with one fewer element
- `sys.stdout` has a space written to it if `at_start` is `False`. Otherwise, `at_start` remains `True`.

Since `at_start` is `False`, `sys.stdout` already has a space written to it. Writing to `sys.stdout` will add the string representation of `x` without an additional space.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `sep` is `' '`
- `file` is `sys.stdout`
- `at_start` remains `False` (since `write` does not affect it)
- `args` is a non-empty iterable with one fewer element
- `sys.stdout` now contains a space followed by the string representation of `x`

Output State: **`sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is a non-empty iterable with one fewer element, `sys.stdout` contains a space followed by the string representation of `x`.**
