`file.flush()` is called, which flushes the output buffer of `file`. However, the exact `file` object is `sys.stdout`, and the precondition does not specify whether flushing `sys.stdout` changes its content or state. The value of `flush` remains unchanged because it is derived from `kwargs.pop('flush', False)`, and no new value is assigned to it. The other variables (`sep`, `at_start`, `args`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`sep` is ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` is an empty iterable; `sys.stdout` contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `\n`; the call to `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is made, and the value of `flush` remains unchanged.**
