`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is `' '` in the initial state) to `file` (which is `sys.stdout` in the initial state). After this operation, the `file` and `sep` variables remain unchanged, but `sys.stdout` will have written a space. The `at_start` and `args` variables are not affected.

Output State: **`sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `sys.stdout` has written a space**
