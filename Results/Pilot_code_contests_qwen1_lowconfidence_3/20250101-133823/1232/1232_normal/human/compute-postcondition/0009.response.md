According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `args` iterable. The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `args`. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and `sys.stdout` has written a space followed by the string representation of `x`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what changes will occur:

1. **`sep`**: This remains `' '` since the separator does not change between iterations.
2. **`file`**: This remains `sys.stdout` since the output file does not change between iterations.
3. **`at_start`**: This changes from `False` to `True` because after printing an item, the next item starts without a preceding space.
4. **`args`**: One element is consumed from the iterable, so the remaining elements are considered for the next iteration.

Given these points, at the start of the next iteration, `at_start` will be `True`, and `args` will have one fewer element than it did at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`, `args` is a non-empty iterable with one fewer element**.
