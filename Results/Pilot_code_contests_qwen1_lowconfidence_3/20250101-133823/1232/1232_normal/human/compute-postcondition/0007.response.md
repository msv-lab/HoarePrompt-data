The code writes the string representation of `x` into `file`. Since `file` is set to `sys.stdout`, this will print `x` to the standard output. The initial state indicates that `sys.stdout` has written a space if `at_start` is `False`. However, since `at_start` is `False`, a space has already been written, and writing another string (the string representation of `x`) will follow this space.

Output State: **`sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `sys.stdout` has written a space followed by the string representation of `x`.**
