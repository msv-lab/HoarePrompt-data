According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop will execute if `args` is a non-empty iterable.

Let's break down the initial state and what needs to be adjusted:

- `sep` is `' '` (a space character)
- `file` is `sys.stdout` (the standard output stream)
- `at_start` is `True`

For the loop to execute, `args` must be a non-empty iterable. The values of `sep`, `file`, and `at_start` do not affect the execution of the loop directly. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `args` to ensure it is a non-empty iterable.

State: **`sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`, `args` must be a non-empty iterable**
