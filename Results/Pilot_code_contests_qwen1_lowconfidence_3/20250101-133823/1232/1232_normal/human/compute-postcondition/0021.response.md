Postcondition: **`sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty iterable, `sys.stdout` contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `\n`. The call to `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is made, but the value of `flush` is not specified in the precondition and thus remains unchanged.**
