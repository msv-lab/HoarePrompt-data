Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `sep` is `' '`
   - `file` is `sys.stdout`
   - `at_start` is `False`
   - `args` is a non-empty iterable with one fewer element
   - `sys.stdout` contains a space followed by the string representation of `x`

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `args`.

3. **What Happens in Each Iteration:**
   - `x` takes the value of the current element from `args`.
   - The loop appends `x` to what was previously printed (which includes a space), and then moves to the next element in `args`.

4. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since we are moving to the next element in `args`, `args` now has one fewer element.
   - `x` is the next element in `args`.
   - `at_start` is updated to `False` because it is not the first element being processed anymore.
   - `sep` remains `' '` as it is the separator between elements.
   - `file` remains `sys.stdout` as it is where the output is written.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `args` is a non-empty iterable with one fewer element.
   - `x` is the next element in `args`.
   - `at_start` is `False`.
   - `sep` is `' '`.
   - `file` is `sys.stdout`.
   - `sys.stdout` will contain the previous output plus the new `x` with a space.

6. **Final State:**
   - The state needs to reflect that `x` is now the next element in `args`, and `args` has one fewer element.
   - `sys.stdout` will contain a space followed by the string representation of `x` after the next iteration.

State: **`sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is a non-empty iterable with one fewer element, `sys.stdout` contains a space followed by the string representation of `x` and potentially other elements from `args`.**
