`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` into the file. This operation does not affect the value of `x` or the contents of `args`. However, it changes the content of `sys.stdout` to reflect the write operation.

- The value of `x` remains unchanged.
- The value of `args` remains unchanged (still has one fewer element).
- The content of `sys.stdout` is updated to show a space followed by the string representation of `x`.

Output State: **`x` is now the next element in `args`, and `args` has one fewer element; sys.stdout will contain a space followed by the string representation of `x` written into the file.**
