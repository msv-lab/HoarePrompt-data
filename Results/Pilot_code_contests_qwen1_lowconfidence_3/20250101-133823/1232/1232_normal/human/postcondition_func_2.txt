The function reads a single line of input from the standard input, which includes an integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 300,000 \)) followed by \( n \) space-separated integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) (where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 300,000 \) and \( a_i \geq a_{i+1} \)). It then splits this input string into separate elements, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and converts these elements into integers. The function returns a map object containing these integers. Potential edge cases include the input string being empty or containing invalid characters, which would result in a ValueError when attempting to convert the input to integers. However, the provided code does not handle such cases, so an exception might occur if the input format is not strictly adhered to.
