The function reads an integer `n` followed by `n` space-separated integers from standard input. It then converts these integers into strings and returns a list of these string representations. This list contains exactly `n` elements, each being a string representation of one of the original integers. The function assumes that `1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000` and that each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 300,000` and `a_i ≥ a_{i+1}`. No edge cases are explicitly handled within the function; however, it is assumed that the input adheres to the given constraints.
