The function `func_14` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. After the computation, the function returns `x` as the GCD and sets `y` to 0. This process handles all edge cases, including when either `x` or `y` is 0 initially, and when both are equal to 0.
