The code reads an integer from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to `size`. This integer represents the number of elements in the array. The initial state of the array (which is an iterable of integers) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`size` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, array is an iterable of integers representing the initial state of the binary heap.**
