Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `size` is 5.

2. **Understand the For Loop:**
   - The loop uses `reversed(range(0, func_3(size)))`.
   - This means the loop will iterate over the range generated by `func_3(size)` in reverse order.

3. **Determine the Range:**
   - `func_3(size)` returns some value, let's call it `k`.
   - The range is `range(k, 0)`, which includes all integers from `k-1` down to 0.

4. **Determine the Value of `k`:**
   - Since `size` is 5, `k = func_3(5)`.
   - Let's assume `func_3(5)` returns a specific value, say `k = 3` (we'll confirm this later).

5. **Initial Values for the Loop:**
   - The loop starts with `i` being the largest number in the range, which is `k-1`.
   - Therefore, initially, `i` would be 2 (if `k = 3`).

6. **Step Through Each Iteration:**
   - In each iteration, `i` decreases by 1 until it reaches 0.

7. **Determine the State After One More Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 (since `i` started at 2 and decreased by 1).
   - For the next iteration, `i` will decrease by 1 again, making it 0.
   - `func_3(size)` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.

8. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - `size` remains 5.
   - `i` will be 0 for the next iteration.
   - `func_3(size)` remains the same, which we assumed to be 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`size` is 5, `i` is 0, `func_3(size)` must return a value that allows the loop to continue. Assuming `func_3(size)` returns 3, it must still return 3.**
