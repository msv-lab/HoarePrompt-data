The function `func_4` accepts three parameters: `array`, `i`, and `item_num`. `array` is a list of integers representing the initial state of the binary heap, `i` is an integer such that 1 <= i < item_num // 2 + 1, and `item_num` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the heap. The function returns a value based on the specified cases.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept a list of integers `array`, an integer `i`, and a positive integer `item_num`, and based on the value of `i`, return either a specific value or handle an error if the conditions are not met.
