Output State: **`size` is 5, `i` is 0, `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called with parameters `array`, `i`, and `size`.**

The function `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called with the provided parameters, but since no specific changes to the variables `size` and `i` are mentioned within the call to `func_4`, their values remain unchanged. The function itself is not defined, so no specific values or outcomes from its execution are known. Thus, only the fact that the function was called is noted in the output state.
