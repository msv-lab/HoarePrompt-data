The code reads integers from standard input, splits them by spaces, and then maps each element to an integer using a lambda function. This means that the `array` variable is now an iterable (typically a list) of integers. The `size` variable remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.

Let's assume the input from `sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')` is "1 2 3 4 5" for demonstration purposes. After the code is executed, `array` will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `size` will remain an integer representing the number of elements in the array, which is 5.

Output State: **`size` is 5; `array` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]**
