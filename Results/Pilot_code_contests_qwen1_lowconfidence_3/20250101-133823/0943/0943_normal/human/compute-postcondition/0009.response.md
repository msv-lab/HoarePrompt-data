The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters, as indicated by the definition `def func_5():`. Given the constraints, the function should work with an internal array and its size, but since these are not passed as parameters, they must be defined within the function.

Output: The function does not have a specified output in the given information, but based on the constraints, it seems the function might modify or work with an internal binary heap represented by an array of integers.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.**
