Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of integers maintaining the max-heap property. If `largest` is not equal to `i`, the value at index `i` is swapped with the value at index `largest`, and `largest` may be different. `i` is an integer such that \(1 \leq i < \text{item\_num} // 2 + 1\), `left` is the index of the left child of the node at index `i`, `right` is the index of the right child of the node at index `i`, `item_num` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the heap, and `tmp` is equal to `array[i]`.***
