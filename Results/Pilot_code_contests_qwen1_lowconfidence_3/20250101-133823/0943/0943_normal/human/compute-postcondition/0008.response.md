Output State: **`size` is 5, `i` is 0, `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called with parameters `array`, `i`, and `size` for each index from `size-1` to 0.**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `size` is 5
   - `array` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `reversed(range(0, func_3(size)))`.
   - Since `size` is 5, `func_3(size)` must return 5 (since `range(0, 5)` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]).
   - Therefore, the loop iterates over `reversed(range(0, 5))`, which is [4, 3, 2, 1, 0].

3. **First Iteration**:
   - `i` is 4
   - `func_4(array, 4, size)` is called
   - After this call, `i` becomes 3 (as per the reversed range).

4. **Second Iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `func_4(array, 3, size)` is called
   - After this call, `i` becomes 2.

5. **Third Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `func_4(array, 2, size)` is called
   - After this call, `i` becomes 1.

6. **Fourth Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `func_4(array, 1, size)` is called
   - After this call, `i` becomes 0.

7. **Fifth Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `func_4(array, 0, size)` is called
   - After this call, `i` is no longer within the range and the loop terminates.

8. **Final State**:
   - `size` remains 5.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called with `array`, `i`, and `size` for each index from `size-1` to 0.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations of the loop have finished, `size` remains unchanged at 5, `i` is 0, and `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called for each index from `size-1` to 0. Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`size` is 5, `i` is 0, `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called with parameters `array`, `i`, and `size` for each index from `size-1` to 0.**
