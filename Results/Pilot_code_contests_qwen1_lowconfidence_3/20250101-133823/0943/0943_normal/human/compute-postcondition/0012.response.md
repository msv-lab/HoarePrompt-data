The code assigns the value of `tmp` to `array[largest]`. Given that `tmp` is equal to `array[i]`, the value at index `i` in the `array` is moved to the `largest` index. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers where the element at index `largest` is now equal to the original element at index `i`, `i` is an integer such that \(1 \leq i < \text{item\_num} // 2 + 1\), `left` is the index of the left child of the node at index `i`, `right` is the index of the right child of the node at index `i`, `item_num` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the heap, `largest` is the index of the largest element among the node at index `i`, its left child, and its right child (if it exists), and `tmp` is equal to `array[i]`.**
