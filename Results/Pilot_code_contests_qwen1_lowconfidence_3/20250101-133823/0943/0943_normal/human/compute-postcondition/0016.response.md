Functionality: **The function `func_4` accepts a list of integers `array`, an integer `i`, and a positive integer `item_num`. It ensures that the sub-tree rooted at index `i` satisfies the max-heap property. Specifically, it finds the largest element among the node at index `i`, its left child, and its right child (if they exist). If the largest element is not the node at index `i`, it swaps the values and recursively calls itself on the affected child node. After the recursive call, the function ensures that the entire sub-tree rooted at index `i` maintains the max-heap property. If `i` is out of bounds or if no valid children exist, no action is taken.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `i` is out of bounds (i.e., `i` is less than 0 or `i` is equal to or greater than `item_num // 2 + 1`), the function will not perform any operations and simply return, leaving the `array` unchanged.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotations suggest that the function might return a specific value or handle an error if the conditions are not met, but the actual code does not include any return statement or error handling. Therefore, the function does not return any value and does not explicitly handle invalid inputs beyond the bounds check.
