The code snippet assigns the value of `array[largest]` to `array[i]`. This means the value at index `i` in the `array` is updated to the value stored at the index `largest`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the conditions:
- `largest` is the index of the largest element among the node at index `i`, its left child, and its right child (if it exists).
- `largest != i` holds true, meaning the largest element is not the element at index `i`.

The output state will be:

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers where the element at index `i` is now equal to the element at index `largest`; `i` is an integer such that \(1 \leq i < \text{item\_num} // 2 + 1\); `left` is the index of the left child of the node at index `i`; `right` is the index of the right child of the node at index `i`; `item_num` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the heap; `largest` is the index of the largest element among the node at index `i`, its left child, and its right child (if it exists); `tmp` is equal to `array[i]`.**
