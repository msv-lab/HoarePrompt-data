Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state given is `size` is 5, `i` is 0, and `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called with parameters `array`, `i`, and `size`.

2. **Loop Definition**: The for loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in reversed(range(0, func_3(size))):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop**: 
   - The `range(0, func_3(size))` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to (but not including) `func_3(size)`.
   - The `reversed()` function reverses this sequence, meaning the loop starts from `func_3(size) - 1` and goes down to 0.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - We know `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration.
   - Since the loop iterates in reverse order, the value of `i` before the current iteration was `func_3(size) - 1`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decreased by 1 from its current value of 0.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `-1` if the loop were to continue, but since `i` is an index and cannot be negative, the loop would stop.

6. **Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop condition is based on the value generated by `reversed(range(0, func_3(size)))`.
   - Since `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the next valid value for `i` before it reaches 0 would be `func_3(size) - 1`.

7. **Determining `func_3(size)`**:
   - Given `size` is 5, we need to find the value of `func_3(5)`.
   - Without the exact implementation of `func_3`, we assume it returns a positive integer value.

8. **Final State**:
   - If `func_3(5)` returns a value, say `k`, then the next valid value for `i` would be `k - 1`.

Since `func_3(size)` is not specified, let's denote it as `k`. The next valid state for the loop to execute one more time would be:
- `i` becomes `k - 1`.
- `size` remains 5.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`size` is 5, `i` is k - 1**, where `k = func_3(5)`.

However, since `func_3(5)` is not explicitly known, we'll keep it in terms of `k`.

Final Answer:
State: **`size` is 5, `i` is k - 1**, where `k = func_3(5)`
