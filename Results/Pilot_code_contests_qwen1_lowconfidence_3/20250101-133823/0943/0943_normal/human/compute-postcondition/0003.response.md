The function `func_4(array, i, size)` is called with parameters `array`, `i`, and `size`. However, the exact definition and behavior of `func_4` are not provided, so we cannot determine the changes it makes to the variables. The only information we have is that `size` is initially 5, and `func_3(5)` must return a value greater than or equal to 1. Since `func_4` is called with `size` as one of its arguments, it does not change the value of `size`. 

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of the variables mentioned:

Output State: **`size` is 5**
