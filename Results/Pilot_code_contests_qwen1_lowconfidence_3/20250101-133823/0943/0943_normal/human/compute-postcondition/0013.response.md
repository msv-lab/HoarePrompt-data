The function `func_4(array, largest, item_num)` is called, but the exact implementation of this function is not provided. However, based on the typical behavior of functions dealing with heaps, especially in the context of maintaining the max-heap property, we can infer that the function might swap the element at index `i` with the largest element among itself, its left child, and its right child, and then recursively call itself on the affected subtree to ensure the heap property is maintained.

Given the initial state:
- `array` is a list of integers.
- The element at index `largest` is equal to the original element at index `i`.
- `i` is an integer such that \(1 \leq i < \text{item\_num} // 2 + 1\).
- `left` is the index of the left child of the node at index `i`.
- `right` is the index of the right child of the node at index `i`.
- `item_num` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the heap.
- `largest` is the index of the largest element among the node at index `i`, its left child, and its right child (if it exists).
- `tmp` is equal to `array[i]`.

Since the function `func_4` is called and assuming it maintains the max-heap property, the following changes could occur:
- The element at index `i` in `array` will be swapped with the element at index `largest`.
- The value of `largest` might change if the swap results in a different largest element among the node at index `i`, its left child, and its right child.
- The function will then recursively call itself on the affected subtree (either the left or right subtree depending on which child became the new largest).

However, without the exact implementation of `func_4`, we can only state that `array` will be updated according to the max-heap property, and the value of `largest` might change. The values of `i`, `left`, `right`, `item_num`, and `tmp` remain unchanged because they are not directly modified by the function call.

Output State: **`array` is updated to maintain the max-heap property, `largest` may be different, `i` is an integer such that \(1 \leq i < \text{item\_num} // 2 + 1\), `left` is the index of the left child of the node at index `i`, `right` is the index of the right child of the node at index `i`, `item_num` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the heap, `tmp` is equal to `array[i]`.**
