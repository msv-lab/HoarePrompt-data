State before the loop starts: `size` is 5; `array` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement.

The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in reversed(range(0, func_3(size))):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means:
1. The loop will iterate over the range generated by `reversed(range(0, func_3(size)))`.
2. The loop variable `i` will take values from `func_3(size) - 1` down to 0.

For the loop to execute, the expression inside `reversed(range(0, func_3(size)))` must generate at least one value. This requires:
- `func_3(size)` to return a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.

Given that `size` is 5, we need to evaluate `func_3(5)`:
- `func_3(5)` must return a value greater than or equal to 1.

Since `size` is fixed at 5, we need to adjust the state such that `func_3(5)` returns a value that ensures the loop body is executed at least once.

Thus, the state should be adjusted to reflect:
- `size` is 5
- `func_3(5)` must return a value greater than or equal to 1

State: **`size` is 5, `func_3(5)` must return a value greater than or equal to 1**
