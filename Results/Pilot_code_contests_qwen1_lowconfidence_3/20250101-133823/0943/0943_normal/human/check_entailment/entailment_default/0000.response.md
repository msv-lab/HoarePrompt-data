Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the buildMaxHeap algorithm to transform an array into a max-heap. Let's break down the verification:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the left child index of a node.
   - The output hints confirm that it works correctly for all valid indices.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the right child index of a node.
   - The output hints confirm that it works correctly for all valid indices.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function calculates the parent index of a node.
   - The output hints confirm that it works correctly for all valid indices.

4. **Function `func_4`:**
   - This function ensures that the sub-tree rooted at a given node satisfies the max-heap property.
   - The output hints confirm that it works correctly by comparing the node with its children and swapping if necessary, then recursively applying the same process to the affected child.

5. **Function `func_5`:**
   - This function reads the size of the heap and the array from input.
   - It then calls `func_4` for each node in a bottom-up manner to build the max-heap.
   - The output hints confirm that it works correctly by iterating over the nodes in reverse order and ensuring the max-heap property for each node.

Given the problem description and the output hints, the code appears to correctly implement the buildMaxHeap algorithm. The functions handle all potential cases as described, and the overall logic follows the steps outlined in the pseudo-code. Therefore, the program is correct.
