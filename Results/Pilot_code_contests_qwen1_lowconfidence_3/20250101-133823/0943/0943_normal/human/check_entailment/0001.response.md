Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program follows the max-heapify and buildMaxHeap procedures described in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. The `func_1` and `func_2` functions correctly compute the left and right child indices of a node.
2. The `func_3` function correctly computes the parent index of a node.
3. The `func_4` function correctly performs the max-heapify operation by comparing the current node with its children and swapping if necessary, and then recursively calling itself on the swapped node if needed.
4. The `func_5` function reads the input, processes it to create an array of heap elements, and then calls `func_4` in a bottom-up manner to construct a max-heap.

Given these functions, the program correctly implements the max-heap construction process as described in the problem statement. There is no apparent issue with the logic or any edge cases that would cause the program to fail according to the provided description and examples.
