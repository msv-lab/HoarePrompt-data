Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program does not fully implement the `maxHeapify` and `buildMaxHeap` procedures as described in the problem description. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - Functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly calculate the indices of the left and right children of a node.
   - Function `func_3` calculates the index of the parent node, which is correct.
   - Function `func_4` is intended to perform `maxHeapify`, but there are discrepancies between the provided code and the problem description.

2. **`func_4` Implementation**:
   - According to the problem description, `func_4` should take an array `A`, an index `i`, and the heap size `H` as arguments. It should find the largest value among the node at index `i` and its children, and if necessary, swap the node with the largest child and recursively call `maxHeapify` on the affected child.
   - However, in the provided code, `func_4` is defined with three arguments: `array`, `i`, and `item_num`. While `item_num` is used instead of `H`, the logic inside the function is correct.

3. **Key Discrepancy**:
   - The main issue lies in the fact that the provided code does not contain the `buildMaxHeap` procedure. The problem description explicitly mentions that the program should construct a max-heap using `buildMaxHeap`, which iterates from the last non-leaf node up to the root and calls `maxHeapify` on each node.
   - The provided code only includes `func_4`, which performs the `maxHeapify` operation, but it does not include the `buildMaxHeap` procedure or any code to initialize the heap construction process.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided code does not include the `buildMaxHeap` procedure, which is a crucial part of the implementation according to the problem description, the program cannot be considered correct. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
