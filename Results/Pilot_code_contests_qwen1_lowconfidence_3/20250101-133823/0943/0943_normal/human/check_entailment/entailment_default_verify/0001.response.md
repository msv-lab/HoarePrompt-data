Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The program correctly implements the max-heap construction process as described in the problem statement. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to calculate the indices of the left child, right child, and parent of a node, respectively, which are essential for the `maxHeapify` operation. The `func_4` function correctly performs the max-heapify operation, ensuring that the heap property is maintained. The `func_5` function reads the input size and the array, then iteratively calls `func_4` starting from the last non-leaf node up to the root, effectively building a max-heap.

The output hints confirm that the program processes the input correctly, transforming the given array into a max-heap. Since the program adheres to the problem description and the output hints align with the expected behavior, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
