Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code for `func_4` does not include a recursive call after swapping the values. According to the max-heapify algorithm, after swapping the value of the current node with its largest child, the function needs to be called recursively on the new position of the swapped value to ensure that the sub-tree rooted at this new position also satisfies the max-heap property. However, the provided code only performs the swap and does not recursively call itself, which can lead to an incomplete max-heap construction. This is evident from the example provided in the problem description and the output hints, which indicate that the heap property might not be fully restored after the initial call to `func_4`.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided code and the problem description, the program does not fully implement the max-heapify operation, leading to a potential violation of the max-heap property. Hence, the final assessment remains **False**.
