Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the `maxHeapify` function. Specifically, the `func_4` function does not recursively call itself after swapping the values to ensure that the sub-tree rooted at `largest` is also a max-heap. This means that after a swap, the heap property might not be maintained in the subtree. 

For example, consider the input:
```
10
4 1 3 2 16 9 10 14 8 7
```

The correct output should be:
```
16 14 10 8 7 9 3 2 4 1
```

However, due to the lack of recursive call in `func_4`, the program might not fully restore the max-heap property, leading to an incorrect output. For instance, the initial call to `func_4` with `i=0` (assuming index starts from 0) will only perform the swap but won't recursively check and fix the subtrees. This results in an incomplete max-heap construction.
