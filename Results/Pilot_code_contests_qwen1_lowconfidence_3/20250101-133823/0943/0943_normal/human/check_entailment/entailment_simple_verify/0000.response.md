Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the annotated version of the code shows that the `func_4` function does not correctly implement the `maxHeapify` algorithm. Specifically, the function does not include a recursive call after swapping the values, which is crucial to ensure that the sub-tree rooted at `largest` is also a max-heap. Without this recursive call, the heap property might not be fully restored, leading to an incorrect output.

For example, consider the input:
```
10
4 1 3 2 16 9 10 14 8 7
```

The correct output should be:
```
16 14 10 8 7 9 3 2 4 1
```

However, due to the lack of recursive call in `func_4`, the program might not fully restore the max-heap property, resulting in an incorrect output. The annotated version confirms that the recursive call is missing, which is why the original assessment is correct.
