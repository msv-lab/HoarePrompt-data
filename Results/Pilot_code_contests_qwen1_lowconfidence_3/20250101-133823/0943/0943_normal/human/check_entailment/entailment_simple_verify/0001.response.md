Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The annotated version provides detailed insights into the state of the program at different points, which aligns well with the problem description and the intended functionality.

1. **Function Definitions**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are correctly defined and implemented according to the problem statement. They accurately compute indices for the left and right children and the parent of a node, and they perform the necessary comparisons and swaps to maintain the max-heap property.

2. **Main Functionality**: The `func_5` function correctly reads the input, processes it to create an array of heap elements, and then calls `func_4` in a bottom-up manner to construct a max-heap. The annotations provided confirm that the program correctly iterates over the relevant indices starting from the last non-leaf node and calls `func_4` to ensure the max-heap property is maintained.

3. **Annotations Support Correctness**: The annotations provide a clear understanding of the state of the program at each step, indicating that the program correctly identifies the largest element among the node, its left child, and its right child, and performs the necessary swaps to maintain the max-heap property.

Based on the detailed annotations and the logic of the functions, the program correctly constructs a max-heap from the given array. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
