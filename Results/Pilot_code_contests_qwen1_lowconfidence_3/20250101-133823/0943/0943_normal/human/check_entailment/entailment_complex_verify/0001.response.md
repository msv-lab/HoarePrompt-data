Final: **True**

Reasoning:
Based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment appears to be accurate. Let's break down the key components:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1(i)`: Computes the left child index correctly as \(2i + 1\).
   - `func_2(i)`: Computes the right child index correctly as \(2i + 2\).
   - `func_3(i)`: Computes the parent index correctly as \(\text{int}((i - 1) / 2)\).
   - These functions are used consistently throughout the program and do not introduce any errors.

2. **`func_4(array, i, item_num)`**:
   - This function correctly identifies the largest element among the node at index `i`, its left child, and its right child.
   - It swaps the values if necessary and recursively ensures that the sub-tree rooted at `i` satisfies the max-heap property.
   - The function handles all cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring the max-heap property is maintained.

3. **`func_5()`**:
   - Reads the size of the heap and the array from input.
   - Calls `func_4` in a bottom-up manner to ensure the entire heap satisfies the max-heap property.
   - The function correctly processes the input and ensures that the heap is built as per the problem requirements.

Given the annotations and the original assessment, there is no evidence to suggest that the program does not meet the problem description. The program correctly implements the max-heapify and buildMaxHeap procedures, ensuring that the heap property is maintained throughout the process. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
