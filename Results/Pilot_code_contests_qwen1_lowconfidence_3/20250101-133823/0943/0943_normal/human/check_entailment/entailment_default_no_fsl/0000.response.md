Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the construction of a max-heap from an input array. The `func_5` function reads the size of the heap and the array from standard input, then calls `func_4` for each index from `size-1` to `0` in a bottom-up manner, ensuring that each node satisfies the max-heap property. The `func_4` function correctly identifies the largest element among a node and its children, and if necessary, swaps values and recursively calls itself to maintain the max-heap property.

The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are implemented according to the problem description and perform the necessary calculations to find left child, right child, and parent indices, respectively. These functions handle all valid input cases without any missing functionalities or edge cases.

Given the problem description and the provided function descriptions, the code appears to handle all necessary operations to construct a max-heap correctly. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
