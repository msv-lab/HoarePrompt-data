Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not fully implement the `maxHeapify` function as described in the problem description. Specifically, the `maxHeapify` function should be called for each node in a bottom-up manner, starting from the last non-leaf node. However, the provided code calls `func_4` for each node from `size-1` to `0` using the `for` loop in `func_5`. While this approach aims to ensure the entire heap satisfies the max-heap property, it misses the key point that the `maxHeapify` function needs to be called recursively to propagate the max-heap property down the tree.

The `maxHeapify` function in the pseudo-code provided should be called recursively to ensure that the subtree rooted at the node satisfies the max-heap property. The `func_4` function in the code attempts to perform this operation but does not include a call to itself recursively for the affected child node when a swap occurs. Therefore, the code fails to guarantee that the entire heap is transformed into a max-heap by recursively ensuring the max-heap property for each subtree.

To correct this, the `func_4` function should include a recursive call to itself after swapping the values to ensure the subtree rooted at the new position of the swapped node satisfies the max-heap property. This recursive call is missing in the current implementation, leading to a partially correct or incorrect program depending on the input.
