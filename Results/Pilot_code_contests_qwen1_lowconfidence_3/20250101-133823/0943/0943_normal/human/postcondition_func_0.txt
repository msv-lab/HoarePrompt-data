The function `func_1` accepts an integer `i` such that \(0 \leq i < H\), where \(H\) is the number of elements in a binary heap. It returns an integer that is calculated as \(2 \times i + 1\). There are no edge cases to consider beyond the given constraint on `i`. The function performs a simple arithmetic operation without any additional actions or validations.
