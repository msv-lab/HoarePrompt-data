This function accepts an integer `i` such that \(1 \leq i \leq H\), where \(H\) is the number of elements in the binary heap. It returns the integer value of \((i - 1) / 2\). This calculation corresponds to finding the parent index of the node at position `i` in a zero-indexed binary heap representation. The function handles all valid inputs within the specified range, ensuring that the returned value is always a non-negative integer. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code; the function correctly implements the required operation without any redundancies.
