Precondition: **size is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array, and array is an iterable of integers representing the initial state of the binary heap.** 

Note: It seems there are some inconsistencies in the provided function `func_5` with respect to the problem description. Typically, we would expect the function to use the `maxHeapify` and `buildMaxHeap` procedures to construct a max-heap. However, the given function does not include these procedures directly. Instead, it reads input and calls another function (`func_3` and `func_4`) which are not defined in the provided code snippet. Based on the problem description and the expected behavior, the precondition is derived from the input and the expected usage of the functions.
