You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: A binary heap which satisfies max-heap property is called max-heap. In a max-heap, for every node $i$ other than the root, $A[i] \leq A[parent(i)]$, that is, the value of a node is at most the value of its parent. The largest element in a max-heap is stored at the root, and the subtree rooted at a node contains values no larger than that contained at the node itself.

Here is an example of a max-heap.

<image>


Write a program which reads an array and constructs a max-heap from the array based on the following pseudo code.

$maxHeapify(A, i)$ move the value of $A[i]$ down to leaves to make a sub-tree of node $i$ a max-heap. Here, $H$ is the size of the heap.


1  maxHeapify(A, i)
2      l = left(i)
3      r = right(i)
4      // select the node which has the maximum value
5      if l ≤ H and A[l] > A[i]
6          largest = l
7      else
8          largest = i
9      if r ≤ H and A[r] > A[largest]
10         largest = r
11
12     if largest ≠ i　// value of children is larger than that of i
13         swap A[i] and A[largest]
14         maxHeapify(A, largest) // call recursively


The following procedure buildMaxHeap(A) makes $A$ a max-heap by performing maxHeapify in a bottom-up manner.


1 buildMaxHeap(A)
2    for i = H/2 downto 1
3        maxHeapify(A, i)




Input

In the first line, an integer $H$ is given. In the second line, $H$ integers which represent elements in the binary heap are given in order of node id (from $1$ to $H$).

Output

Print values of nodes in the max-heap in order of their id (from $1$ to $H$). Print a single space character before each value.

Example

Input

10
4 1 3 2 16 9 10 14 8 7


Output

16 14 10 8 7 9 3 2 4 1
Program:
```
def func_5():
    size = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    array = map(lambda x: int(x), sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' '))
    for i in reversed(range(0, func_3(size))):
        func_4(array, i, size)
```
