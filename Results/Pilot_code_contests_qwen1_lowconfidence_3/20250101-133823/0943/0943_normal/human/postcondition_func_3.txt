The function `func_4` accepts a list of integers `array`, an integer `i`, and a positive integer `item_num`. It ensures that the sub-tree rooted at index `i` satisfies the max-heap property. Specifically, it finds the largest element among the node at index `i`, its left child, and its right child (if they exist). If the largest element is not the node at index `i`, it swaps the values and recursively calls itself on the affected child node. After the recursive call, the function ensures that the entire sub-tree rooted at index `i` maintains the max-heap property. If `i` is out of bounds or if no valid children exist, no action is taken.
