The function reads the size of a binary heap and its initial state from standard input, then calls `func_4` for each index from `size-1` to `0`. After executing the for loop, the binary heap is transformed such that each node is greater than or equal to its children (satisfying the max-heap property). The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. Note that the function assumes valid input where `size` is a positive integer and the array represents a valid binary heap structure before calling `func_4`. If the input does not meet these assumptions, the behavior of `func_4` could be undefined.
