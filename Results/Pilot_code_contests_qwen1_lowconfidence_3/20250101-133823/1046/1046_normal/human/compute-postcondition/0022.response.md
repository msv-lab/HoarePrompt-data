Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\)
   - `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\)
   - `portal_jumps` is \(1 + (n + 1) \% 1000000007 + 1 + dp[j] \% (1000000000.0 + 7)\)
   - `i` is `n`
   - `p[i]` is less than `n`

2. The code snippet to be executed is:
   ```python
   portal_jumps += 1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)
   ```

3. Breaking down the operations in the code snippet:
   - `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` evaluates to 1 because 1 modulo any large number (greater than 1) is 1.
   - Therefore, `portal_jumps += 1` increments `portal_jumps` by 1.

4. Updating the `portal_jumps` variable:
   - Initially, `portal_jumps` is calculated as \(1 + (n + 1) \% 1000000007 + 1 + dp[j] \% (1000000000.0 + 7)\).
   - After executing `portal_jumps += 1`, `portal_jumps` becomes \(1 + (n + 1) \% 1000000007 + 1 + dp[j] \% (1000000000.0 + 7) + 1\).

5. The rest of the variables remain unchanged according to the provided initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\); `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\); `portal_jumps` is \(1 + (n + 1) \% 1000000007 + 1 + dp[j] \% (1000000000.0 + 7) + 1`; `i` is `n`; `p[i]` is less than `n`.**
