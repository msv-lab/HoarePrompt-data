The code snippet increments `portal_jumps` by `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)`. Given that `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` is simply `1`, `portal_jumps` will be updated by adding `1` to its current value.

Let's denote the initial value of `portal_jumps` as `portal_jumps_initial`. The updated value of `portal_jumps` will be `portal_jumps_initial + 1`.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\)
- `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\)
- `portal_jumps` is \((3 + dp[j] \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + dp[j] \% (1000000000.0 + 7)\)
- `i` is `2`

After the code executes, `portal_jumps` is updated as follows:
- `portal_jumps` is updated to `portal_jumps_initial + 1`

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\)
- `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\)
- `portal_jumps` is \((3 + dp[j] \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + dp[j] \% (1000000000.0 + 7) + 1\)
- `i` is `2`

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\), `portal_jumps` is \((3 + dp[j] \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + dp[j] \% (1000000000.0 + 7) + 1\), `i` is `2`**
