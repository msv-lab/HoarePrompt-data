Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\).
   - `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\).
   - `portal_jumps` is \(3n + 7\).
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `dp[i]` is `int((3n + 7) \% 1000000007)`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop condition `i in range(n)` means the loop will iterate from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n` (at the end of the previous iteration), it does not satisfy the condition `i < n`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be within the range `0` to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to `0` for the next iteration.
   - Other variables (`n`, `p`, `dp`, `portal_jumps`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop itself.

5. **New State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `n` remains the same: \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
   - `p` remains the same: a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\).
   - `dp` remains the same: a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\).
   - `portal_jumps` remains the same: \(3n + 7\).
   - `i` is now `0` for the next iteration.
   - `dp[i]` is now `int((3 * 0 + 7) \% 1000000007) = 7`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\); `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\); `portal_jumps` is \(3n + 7\); `i` is `0`; `dp[i]` is `7`**.
