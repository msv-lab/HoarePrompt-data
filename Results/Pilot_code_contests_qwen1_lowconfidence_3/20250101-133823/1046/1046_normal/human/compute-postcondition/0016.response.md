The code `portal_jumps = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `portal_jumps`. This changes the value of `portal_jumps` from its previous value (which was `n + 1`) to `1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is `(n + 1) \% 1000000007`, `portal_jumps` is `1`, `i` is `n`**
