The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `p`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10³, and `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ p[i] ≤ i for each 0 ≤ i < n. 

Case_1: If the conditions for `n` and the elements in `p` are not met, the function returns an error message indicating invalid input.

Case_2: If the conditions are met, the function does not explicitly return a value from within the given output cases. Therefore, we can infer that it might return some computed value or perform an action without returning anything specifically mentioned here.

Based on the given information, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `n` and a list `p` under specific constraints, and either return an error message if the constraints are not met or perform some operation (without a specific return value mentioned).

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `p` under specified constraints, and either returns an error message if the constraints are not met or performs some operation without explicitly returning a value.**
