The given code is a comment block and does not contain any executable statements. It describes a problem and a potential solution using dynamic programming. Since there are no executable statements, the variables `n` and `p` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10³, and `p` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p[i] ≤ i for each 0 ≤ i < n.**
