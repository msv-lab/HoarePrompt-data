The code increments `portal_jumps` by `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)`, which simplifies to `1 % 1000000007` because the additional `7` does not affect the modulo operation. The value of `1 % 1000000007` is `1`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\)
- `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\)
- `portal_jumps` is \(3 + 3 \times ((n + 1) \% 1000000007)\)
- `i` is `n`
- `p[i]` is less than `n`

After the code execution:
- `portal_jumps` is updated to `portal_jumps + 1 % 1000000007`, which means `portal_jumps` is incremented by `1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\); `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\); `portal_jumps` is \(3 + 3 \times ((n + 1) \% 1000000007) + 1\); `i` is `n`; `p[i]` is less than `n`.**
