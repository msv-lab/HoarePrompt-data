Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total_pjumps` is \(((n + 1) \mod 1000000007 + 1) \mod 1000000007\)
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning it runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

3. **Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0 (indicating the first iteration has just completed).
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop condition `i < n` will be true if `n` is greater than 0.
   - After the current iteration, `i` will increment by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must remain the same (since it does not change within the loop body).

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `total_pjumps` remains the same as it was calculated before the loop started and is not modified inside the loop.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.
   - `n` must remain the same as it did not change during the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`total_pjumps` is \(((n + 1) \mod 1000000007 + 1) \mod 1000000007\), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)**
