The given code snippet prints the value of `total_pjumps`. Since printing does not change the value of `total_pjumps`, the value of `total_pjumps` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total_pjumps` is equal to \(\left( (n + 1) \mod 1000000007 + \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} dp[i] + n \right) \mod 1000000007\), `i` is \(n\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)**
