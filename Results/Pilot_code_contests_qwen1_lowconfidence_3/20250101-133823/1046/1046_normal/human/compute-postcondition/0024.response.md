The code snippet updates the value of `portal_jumps` by adding `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` to its current value. Given the initial state, `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\), and `portal_jumps` is initially \(1 + (n + 1) \% 1000000007 + 1 + dp[j] \% (1000000000.0 + 7) + 1\). Since `j` is not defined in the provided code snippet, let's assume `j` is an index within the range of the `dp` list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\)
- `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\)
- `portal_jumps` is \(1 + (n + 1) \% 1000000007 + 1 + dp[j] \% (1000000000.0 + 7) + 1\)
- `i` is `n`
- `p[i]` is less than `n`

After the code snippet executes:
- The value of `portal_jumps` is updated to `portal_jumps + dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`

Since `dp[j]` is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\), the updated value of `portal_jumps` is:
\[ portal_jumps = 1 + (n + 1) \% 1000000007 + 1 + (n + 1) \% 1000000007 \% (1000000000.0 + 7) + 1 + (n + 1) \% 1000000007 \]

Simplifying the expression, since \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\) is an integer and does not change the modulo operation when added multiple times, we get:
\[ portal_jumps = 1 + (n + 1) \% 1000000007 + 1 + (n + 1) \% 1000000007 + 1 + (n + 1) \% 1000000007 \]
\[ portal_jumps = 3 + 3 \times ((n + 1) \% 1000000007) \]

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\); `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\); `portal_jumps` is \(3 + 3 \times ((n + 1) \% 1000000007)\); `i` is `n`; `p[i]` is less than `n`.**
