The code initializes a list `dp` with `n` zeros. This means that `dp` is now a list of length `n` where each element is `0`. The values of `n` and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10³, and `p` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p[i] ≤ i for each 0 ≤ i < n; `dp` is a list of n zeros.**
