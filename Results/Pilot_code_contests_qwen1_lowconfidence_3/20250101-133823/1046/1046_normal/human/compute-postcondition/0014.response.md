The code snippet assigns the value of `portal_jumps % (1000000000.0 + 7)` to `dp[i]` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. Given that `portal_jumps` is `n + 1`, we substitute `n + 1` into the expression.

For each `i`:
\[ dp[i] = (n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7) \]

Since `dp` is initially a list of `n` zeros, after running the code, each element `dp[i]` will be updated to the value of `(n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)`.

Given the range of `n` is \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), the value of `1000000000.0 + 7` is a constant, and the modulo operation will yield a result between 0 and \(1000000007 - 1\).

Let's denote this constant as `constant_value`:
\[ constant_value = 1000000000.0 + 7 = 1000000007 \]

So, for each `i`:
\[ dp[i] = (n + 1) \% 1000000007 \]

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is `(n + 1) \% 1000000007`, `portal_jumps` is `n + 1`**
