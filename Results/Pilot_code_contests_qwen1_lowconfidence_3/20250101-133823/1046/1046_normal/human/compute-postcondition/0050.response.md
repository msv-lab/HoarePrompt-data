The initial state is defined such that `total_pjumps` is equal to `(((n + 1) % 1000000007 + 1) % 1000000007 + dp[1] % 1000000007 + 1)` and `i` is 2.

The code snippet `total_pjumps += dp[i] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` updates `total_pjumps` by adding `dp[i] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` to its current value. Since `i` is 2, the value being added is `dp[2] % 1000000007` (ignoring the decimal part in the modulo operation).

Thus, `total_pjumps` becomes:

\[ \text{total\_pjumps} = (((n + 1) \% 1000000007 + 1) \% 1000000007 + dp[1] \% 1000000007 + 1 + dp[2] \% 1000000007) \]

The variable `i` remains unchanged at 2. 

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`total_pjumps` is (((n + 1) % 1000000007 + 1) % 1000000007 + dp[1] % 1000000007 + 1 + dp[2] % 1000000007); `i` is 2**
