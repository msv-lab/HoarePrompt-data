`portal_jumps` is incremented by `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`. The value of `j` is defined as `p[i] + 1`, and since `p[i]` is a value in the range from 1 to `i` and less than `i`, `j` will be a value from 2 to `i+1`. However, the specific value of `dp[j]` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact increment to `portal_jumps`. But we know that `dp[j]` is initially set to 0 for all `j`, so `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` will be 0.

Therefore, `portal_jumps` remains unchanged, as the increment by 0 does not affect its value. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\), `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `portal_jumps` is 3, `j` is `p[i] + 1**
