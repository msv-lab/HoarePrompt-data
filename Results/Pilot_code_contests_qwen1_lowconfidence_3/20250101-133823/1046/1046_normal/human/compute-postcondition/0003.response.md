The code initializes the variable `portal_jumps` to 1. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `p`, or `dp`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `portal_jumps`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, `p` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p[i] ≤ i for each 0 ≤ i < n, `dp` is a list of n zeros, `portal_jumps` is 1**
