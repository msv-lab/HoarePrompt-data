The code snippet `total_pjumps += 1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` updates the value of `total_pjumps`. Let's break it down:

1. The expression `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` calculates the remainder when 1 is divided by 1000000007.0, which results in 1 because 1 is less than 1000000007.0.
2. The updated value of `total_pjumps` is the original value of `total_pjumps` plus 1.

Given the initial state:
- `total_pjumps` is \(((n + 1) \mod 1000000007 + 1) \mod 1000000007 + dp[1] \mod 1000000007\)
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)

After executing the code snippet, the new value of `total_pjumps` is:
\[ \text{new\_total\_pjumps} = ((n + 1) \mod 1000000007 + 1) \mod 1000000007 + dp[1] \mod 1000000007 + 1 \]

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_pjumps` is (((n + 1) % 1000000007 + 1) % 1000000007 + dp[1] % 1000000007 + 1), `i` is 1**
