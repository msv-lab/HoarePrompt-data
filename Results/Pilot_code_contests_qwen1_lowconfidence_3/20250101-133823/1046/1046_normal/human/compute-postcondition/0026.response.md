Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\); `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\); `portal_jumps` is \(4 + 3 \times ((n + 1) \% 1000000007)\); `i` is `n`; `p[i]` is less than `n`.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\).
   - `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\).
   - `portal_jumps` is initially \(1\).
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `p[i]` is less than `n`.

2. **Loop Execution Analysis:**
   - The loop runs for each `j` in the range from `p[i]` to `i-1`.
   - Inside the loop, `portal_jumps` is updated twice:
     - `portal_jumps += dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`: This increments `portal_jumps` by `dp[j] % 1000000007`.
     - `portal_jumps += 1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)`: This increments `portal_jumps` by `1 % 1000000007`, which simplifies to `1`.

3. **Loop Iterations:**
   - After the first iteration of the loop, `portal_jumps` becomes \(1 + dp[p[i]] + 1 = 3 + dp[p[i]]\).
   - After the second iteration of the loop, `portal_jumps` becomes \(3 + dp[p[i]] + dp[j_1] + 1 = 4 + dp[p[i]] + dp[j_1]\).
   - After the third iteration of the loop, `portal_jumps` becomes \(4 + dp[p[i]] + dp[j_1] + dp[j_2] + 1 = 5 + dp[p[i]] + dp[j_1] + dp[j_2]\).

4. **General Case:**
   - After `k` iterations of the loop, `portal_jumps` becomes \(3 + k + \sum_{j \in [p[i], i-1]} dp[j]\).
   - Since `p[i] < i`, the loop will always execute at least once, and the sum of `dp[j]` terms will be a constant value due to the initial condition that each `dp[j]` is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\).

5. **Final Output State:**
   - The loop will always execute at least once, so `portal_jumps` will be \(3 + 3 \times ((n + 1) \% 1000000007)\).
   - The final values of the other variables remain the same as their initial conditions.

Thus, the final output state is as stated above.
