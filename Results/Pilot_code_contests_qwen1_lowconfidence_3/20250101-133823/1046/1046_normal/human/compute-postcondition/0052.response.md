Output State: **`total_pjumps` is equal to \(\left( (n + 1) \mod 1000000007 + \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} dp[i] + n \right) \mod 1000000007\), `i` is \(n\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\).**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
- In each iteration, `total_pjumps` is updated by adding `dp[i] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` and `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)`.
- Since the modulo operation is performed with `1000000007`, the addition operations inside the loop effectively accumulate `dp[i]` and `1` for each `i`.
- After the loop completes, `total_pjumps` will hold the sum of all `dp[i]` values plus `n` (each iteration adds `1`), all taken modulo `1000000007`.

If the loop does not execute (`n == 0`), then `total_pjumps` remains `0`.
