The code `portal_jumps += 1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` increments the value of `portal_jumps` by 1 modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\). Given the initial state where `portal_jumps` is 1, the new value of `portal_jumps` will be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{new\_value} = (1 + 1) \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) = 2 \mod 1000000007 = 2 \]

The other variables (`n`, `p`, `dp`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where `1 ≤ p[i] ≤ i` for each `0 ≤ i < n` and `p[i] < i` for at least one `i`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `portal_jumps` is 2.**
