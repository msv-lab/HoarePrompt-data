Let's break down the given for loop and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

The for loop statement is:
```python
for j in range(p[i], i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for all `j` in the range from `p[i]` to `i` (not inclusive).

2. **Variables Involved**:
   - `p[i]`: The lower bound of the range.
   - `i`: The upper bound of the range.
   - `j`: The loop variable that takes values from `p[i]` to `i-1`.

3. **Constraints**:
   - `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3`: `n` is an integer within this range.
   - `1 ≤ p[i] ≤ i`: For each `0 ≤ i < n`, the value of `p[i]` is between 1 and `i`.
   - `dp` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - `portal_jumps` is 1.

4. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will run if there exists at least one `j` such that `p[i] ≤ j < i`.

5. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3`.
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where `1 ≤ p[i] ≤ i` for each `0 ≤ i < n`.
   - `dp` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - `portal_jumps` is 1.

6. **Adjusting the States**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that the range `range(p[i], i)` is non-empty, meaning there should be at least one `j` such that `p[i] ≤ j < i`.
   - This implies that `p[i]` should be less than `i` for the loop to run.

### Final Adjusted State:
Given the above analysis, we need to ensure that for at least one `i`, the condition `p[i] < i` holds true. Therefore, we adjust the initial state to reflect this requirement.

**State:**
- `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3`.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where `1 ≤ p[i] ≤ i` for each `0 ≤ i < n` and `p[i] < i` for at least one `i`.
- `dp` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `portal_jumps` is 1.

This ensures that the loop can execute for at least one iteration.
