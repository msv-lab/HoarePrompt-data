Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Loop Variables and Conditions**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(p[i], i):`. For this loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
   - `p[i]` should be less than `i` (since `j` ranges from `p[i]` to `i-1`).
   - `i` must be greater than or equal to `p[i]`.
   - The range `p[i]` to `i-1` must not be empty.

2. **Current States**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\).
   - `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\).
   - `portal_jumps` is `1`.
   - `i` is `n`.

3. **Adjusting States for Loop Execution**:
   - Since `i` is currently set to `n`, and the loop requires `p[i]` to be less than `i`, we need to ensure that `p[i]` is less than `n`. Given the condition \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) and \(p[i] < i\), we know that `p[i]` can be any value from `1` to `n-1`. However, for the loop to execute, `p[i]` must be strictly less than `i` (i.e., `p[i] < n`).

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `i` must be `n`, and `p[i]` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the final state should be:
**`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\), `portal_jumps` is `1`, `i` is `n`, and `p[i]` is less than `n`.**

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\), `portal_jumps` is `1`, `i` is `n`, and `p[i]` is less than `n`.**
