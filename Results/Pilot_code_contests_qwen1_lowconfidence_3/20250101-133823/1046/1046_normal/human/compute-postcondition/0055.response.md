Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a list `p` of length `n`. It calculates the number of portal jumps required for Vasya to get from each room `i` (with an odd number of crosses) to another room with an even number of crosses and back, using the given portal connections defined by `p`. After performing these calculations, it sums up the total number of portal jumps required for all rooms and prints this sum modulo \(1000000007\). The function does not return a value; instead, it directly prints the result. Potential edge cases include invalid input values for `n` or `p`, which the function currently does not handle. If `n` is outside the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\) or any element in `p` does not satisfy \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\), the function will produce unexpected results due to the lack of validation.**
