The code snippet modifies the value of `portal_jumps` by adding `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` to its current value. The value of `i` remains unchanged. The initial value of `portal_jumps` is given as `3 + dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`. After executing the line `portal_jumps += dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`, the new value of `portal_jumps` will be the sum of its original value and `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\)
- `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\)
- `portal_jumps` is now `(3 + dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)) + dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`
- `i` is `2`

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\); `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\); `portal_jumps` is `(3 + dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)) + dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`; `i` is `2`**
