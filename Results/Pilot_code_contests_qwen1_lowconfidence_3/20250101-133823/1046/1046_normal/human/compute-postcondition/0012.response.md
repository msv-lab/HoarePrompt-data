The code `portal_jumps += 1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` increments `portal_jumps` by 1 modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\). Given that `portal_jumps` is initially 3, adding 1 to it results in 4. Since \(1000000000.0 + 7\) is a large number, the modulo operation does not change the value, so `portal_jumps` remains 4.

The values of the other variables (`n`, `p`, `dp`, and `j`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\), `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `portal_jumps` is 4, `j` is `p[i] + 1**
