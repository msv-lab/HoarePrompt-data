The code initializes the variable `total_pjumps` to 0. This assignment does not change the values of `n`, `p`, or `dp`. Therefore, the only variable affected is `total_pjumps`, which is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\), `total_pjumps` is 0.**
