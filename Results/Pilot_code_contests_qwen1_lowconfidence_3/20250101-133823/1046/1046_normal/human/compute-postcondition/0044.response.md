The code snippet updates `total_pjumps` by adding `dp[i] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` to `total_pjumps`. Given that `i` is currently 0 and `dp` is a list of `(n + 1) % 1000000007` for each index, the value of `dp[0]` is `(n + 1) % 1000000007`.

Let's calculate the updated value of `total_pjumps`:
- Initial value of `total_pjumps`: 0
- Value of `dp[0]`: `(n + 1) % 1000000007`

Therefore, the new value of `total_pjumps` will be:
\[ \text{total\_pjumps} = 0 + (n + 1) \% 1000000007 = (n + 1) \% 1000000007 \]

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `p`, and `dp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_pjumps` is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)**
