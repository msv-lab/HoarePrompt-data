`total_pjumps` is updated by adding `dp[i] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` to its current value. Given that `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `total_pjumps` initially is \(((n + 1) \mod 1000000007 + 1) \mod 1000000007\).

Since `i` is 1, `dp[i]` is `dp[1]`. The expression `dp[1] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` simplifies to `dp[1] % 1000000007` because the floating point number is effectively treated as an integer in this context.

Therefore, `total_pjumps` becomes \(((n + 1) \mod 1000000007 + 1) \mod 1000000007 + dp[1] \mod 1000000007\).

Given the initial state of `total_pjumps`, the output state is:

Output State: **`total_pjumps` is \(((n + 1) \mod 1000000007 + 1) \mod 1000000007 + dp[1] \mod 1000000007\), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)**.
