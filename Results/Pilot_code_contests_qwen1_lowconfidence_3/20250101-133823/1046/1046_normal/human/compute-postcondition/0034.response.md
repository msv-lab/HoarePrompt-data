The code snippet `portal_jumps += dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` impacts the `portal_jumps` variable by adding the value of `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` to `portal_jumps`. However, the value of `j` is not specified in the initial state or within the code snippet. Since `dp[i]` is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\) and `i` is 1, `dp[1]` is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\). But without knowing the exact value of `j`, we cannot determine the exact increment to `portal_jumps`.

Given the initial conditions and the code snippet, the output state includes:

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\).
- `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\).
- `portal_jumps` is `2` plus the value of `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`.
- `i` is `1`.
- `dp[i]` is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\).

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\); `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\); `portal_jumps` is `2 + dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`; `i` is `1`; `dp[i]` is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\)**.
