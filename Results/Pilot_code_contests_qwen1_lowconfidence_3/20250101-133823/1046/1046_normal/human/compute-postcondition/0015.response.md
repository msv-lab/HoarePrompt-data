According to the code, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\)
- `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is `(n + 1) \% 1000000007`
- `portal_jumps` is `n + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n` must still hold true. Since `i` was incremented at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new`.

Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, `i_new = i + 1`. For the loop to continue, `i_new` must still be less than `n`, i.e., `i + 1 < n`. This implies that `i` was previously `n - 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented to `n`
- The condition `i < n` will no longer hold true, meaning the loop will terminate.

However, based on the question's requirement to modify the states for the next iteration, we need to adjust the state to reflect the new values of `i` and ensure the loop condition is maintained:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is `(n + 1) \% 1000000007`, `portal_jumps` is `n + 1`, `i` is \(n\)**

This ensures that at the start of the next iteration, the loop condition will no longer be satisfied, and the loop will terminate.
