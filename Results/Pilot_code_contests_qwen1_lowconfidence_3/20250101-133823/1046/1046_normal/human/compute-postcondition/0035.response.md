The code snippet `portal_jumps += 1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` increments `portal_jumps` by 1. Since `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` is simply 1 (as 1 modulo any number greater than 1 is 1), `portal_jumps` is effectively incremented by 1.

Let's summarize the changes:
- `portal_jumps` was originally `2 + dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`.
- After the code runs, `portal_jumps` is now `2 + dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7) + 1`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\); `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\); `portal_jumps` is `3 + dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`; `i` is `1`; `dp[i]` is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\)**
