`total_pjumps` is incremented by \(1 \mod (1000000007)\). The initial value of `total_pjumps` is \((n + 1) \mod 1000000007\). Adding 1 to this value and then taking modulo 1000000007 gives the new value of `total_pjumps`. Since \(1000000000.0 + 7\) is not used in the operation due to the modulo operation constraints, the calculation simplifies to adding 1 directly.

Let's denote the initial value of `total_pjumps` as \(T\), where \(T = (n + 1) \mod 1000000007\). After executing the code, the new value of `total_pjumps` will be \((T + 1) \mod 1000000007\).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`total_pjumps` is \(((n + 1) \mod 1000000007 + 1) \mod 1000000007\), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)**
