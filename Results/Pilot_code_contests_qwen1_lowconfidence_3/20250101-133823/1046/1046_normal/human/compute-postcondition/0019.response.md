The code snippet increments `portal_jumps` by `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)`. Given that \(1000000000.0 + 7 = 1000000007\), the expression `1 % 1000000007` evaluates to `1`. Therefore, `portal_jumps` is incremented by `1`.

Here's the breakdown:

- Initial State: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\); `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\); `portal_jumps` is `1 + (n + 1) \% 1000000007`; `i` is `n`; `p[i]` is less than `n`.
- After the code `portal_jumps += 1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` executes, `portal_jumps` is incremented by `1`.

So, the updated state is:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\)
- `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\)
- `portal_jumps` is now \(1 + (n + 1) \% 1000000007 + 1\)
- `i` is `n`
- `p[i]` is less than `n`

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\); `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\); `portal_jumps` is \(1 + (n + 1) \% 1000000007 + 1\); `i` is `n`; `p[i]` is less than `n`.**
