Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - \( n \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^3 \)
   - \( p \) is a list of \( n \) integers where \( 1 \leq p[i] \leq i \) for each \( 0 \leq i < n \) and \( p[i] < i \) for at least one \( i \)
   - \( dp \) is a list of \( n \) zeros
   - \( portal_jumps \) is 2

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(p[i], i):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Analysis:**
   - The loop runs over the range from \( p[i] \) to \( i \) (exclusive).
   - For the loop to execute again, \( j \) must increment within this range.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, \( j \) would have iterated from \( p[i] \) up to but not including \( i \).
   - The loop will continue if \( p[i] < i - 1 \).

5. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop increments \( j \), it will continue as long as \( p[i] < i - 1 \).
   - If the loop does continue, \( j \) will start from \( p[i] + 1 \).

6. **Updated States:**
   - \( n \) remains the same since it doesn't affect the loop condition directly.
   - \( p \) remains the same since it doesn't change within the loop.
   - \( dp \) remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
   - \( portal_jumps \) remains 2 since it is not affected by the loop.

7. **New Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues if \( j \) can increment to \( i - 1 \). This means \( j \) starts from \( p[i] + 1 \).

8. **Final State:**
   - Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that \( j \) has incremented to \( p[i] + 1 \).

**State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^3 \), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \( 1 \leq p[i] \leq i \) for each \( 0 \leq i < n \) and \( p[i] < i \) for at least one \( i \), `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `portal_jumps` is 2, `j` is \( p[i] + 1 \)**.
