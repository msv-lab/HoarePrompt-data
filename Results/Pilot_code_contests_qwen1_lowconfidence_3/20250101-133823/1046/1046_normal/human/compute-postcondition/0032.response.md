The code increments `portal_jumps` by `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)`. Given that the value of `1000000000.0 + 7` is `1000000007.0`, taking `1 % 1000000007.0` results in `1` because 1 is less than 1000000007.0. Therefore, `portal_jumps` is incremented by `1`.

Output State: **`total` is not applicable, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\), `portal_jumps` is `2`, `i` is `0`, `dp[i]` is `7`**
