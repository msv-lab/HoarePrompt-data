Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\).
   - `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\).
   - `portal_jumps` is \(1 + (n + 1) \% 1000000007 + 1 + dp[j] \% (1000000000.0 + 7) + 1\).
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `p[i]` is less than `n`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(p[i], i):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop starts with `j` being initialized to `p[i]` and runs until `j` is less than `i`.
   - Since `i` is `n`, the loop will run from `p[n]` to `n-1` (if `p[n]` is less than `n`).

4. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `p[i]` is less than `n`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `i`.
   - Currently, `j` starts from `p[i]` (which is less than `n`), and the loop will increment `j` until it reaches `i-1`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` remains `n` since it is the upper bound of the loop.
   - `p[i]` remains less than `n` because it does not change within the loop.
   - `p` and `dp` lists remain unchanged.
   - `portal_jumps` is calculated inside the loop and does not affect the loop condition.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:

- `i` remains `n`.
- `p[i]` remains less than `n`.

Since `i` and `p[i]` are the only variables that directly influence the loop condition and they do not change based on the loop execution, the states are already correctly set for the loop to potentially execute again.

**State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\); `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\); `portal_jumps` is \(1 + (n + 1) \% 1000000007 + 1 + dp[j] \% (1000000000.0 + 7) + 1`; `i` is `n`; `p[i]` is less than `n`.**
