Let's analyze the given code snippet step-by-step:

1. Initial State:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\)
   - `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\)
   - `portal_jumps` is `1`
   - `i` is `n`
   - `p[i]` is less than `n`

2. Code Execution:
   ```python
   portal_jumps += dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)
   ```
   This line increments `portal_jumps` by `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`. However, there is no variable `j` defined in the provided context, which leads to an undefined behavior. Assuming this is a mistake and we proceed with the understanding that `j` should be a valid index within the range `[0, n-1]`, let's assume `j` is valid and within the bounds.

3. Variable Values After Execution:
   - `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\), so `dp[j]` would be \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\).
   - `portal_jumps` is incremented by `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`, which simplifies to \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\), because the modulus operation is applied to an integer and a float addition, and the float addition doesn't affect the integer result.

Therefore, the updated value of `portal_jumps` is `1 + (n + 1) \% 1000000007`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\); `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\); `portal_jumps` is `1 + (n + 1) \% 1000000007`; `i` is `n`; `p[i]` is less than `n`.**
