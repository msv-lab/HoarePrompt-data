First, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
dp[i] = int(portal_jumps % (1000000000.0 + 7))
```

- `dp[i]` is assigned the value of `int(portal_jumps % (1000000000.0 + 7))`.
- `portal_jumps` is defined as `4 + 3 * ((n + 1) % 1000000007)`.
- `i` is defined as `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\).
- `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\).
- `portal_jumps` is \(4 + 3 \times ((n + 1) \% 1000000007)\).
- `i` is `n`.
- `p[i]` is less than `n`.

Now, let's calculate the new value of `dp[i]`:

1. Calculate `portal_jumps`:
   \[
   portal_jumps = 4 + 3 \times ((n + 1) \% 1000000007)
   \]
   Since \(n\) is within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\) will be simply \(n + 1\) because \(n + 1\) is much smaller than \(1000000007\).

   So,
   \[
   portal_jumps = 4 + 3 \times (n + 1) = 4 + 3n + 3 = 3n + 7
   \]

2. Calculate `dp[i]`:
   \[
   dp[i] = int((3n + 7) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))
   \]
   Since we are taking the modulo operation, the result will be between 0 and \(1000000006\) (because \(1000000000.0 + 7 = 1000000007\)).

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:
- `dp[i]` is now `int((3n + 7) \% 1000000007)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(p[i] < i\) for at least one \(i\); `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is \((n + 1) \% 1000000007\); `portal_jumps` is \(3n + 7\); `i` is `n`; `dp[i]` is `int((3n + 7) \% 1000000007)`**.
