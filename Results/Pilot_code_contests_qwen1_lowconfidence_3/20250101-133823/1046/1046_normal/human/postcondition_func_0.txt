The function `func_1` reads pairs of values from standard input (represented by the `line` parameter), where each pair consists of an integer `n` and a list `P` of `n` integers. The integer `n` represents the number of elements in the list `P`. Each element `p_i` in the list `P` is an integer that is one less than the corresponding integer read from the input. The function yields these pairs indefinitely until the end of the input stream. The state of the program after each iteration of the loop is that `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), and `P` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(p_i\) in `P` is one less than the corresponding integer read from the input. If the input stream ends, the function will stop yielding pairs.
