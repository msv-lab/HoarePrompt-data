Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the recurrence relation used in `func_2` is incorrect. The annotated version confirms that the program calculates the number of portal jumps in a way that does not match the problem requirements. 

According to the problem description, Vasya should use the second portal if the current room has an odd number of crosses and the first portal otherwise. However, the current implementation does not reflect this behavior correctly. The annotated version shows that the program is calculating the number of portal jumps without properly alternating between using the first and second portals based on the number of crosses.

For example, consider the input:
```
n = 3
P = [1, 1, 3]
```

The expected sequence of moves, as per the problem description, should be:
1. Start at room 1 (odd crosses, so use second portal to room 1).
2. Room 1 again (even crosses, so use first portal to room 2).
3. Room 2 (odd crosses, so use second portal to room 1).
4. Room 1 again (even crosses, so use first portal to room 2).
5. Room 2 again (even crosses, so use first portal to room 3).

This results in a total of 6 portal moves. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of moves due to the flawed logic in the recurrence relation. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program remains incorrect.
