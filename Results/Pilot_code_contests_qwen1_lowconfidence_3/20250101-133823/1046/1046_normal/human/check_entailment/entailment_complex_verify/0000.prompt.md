You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, little Vasya found himself in a maze consisting of (n + 1) rooms, numbered from 1 to (n + 1). Initially, Vasya is at the first room and to get out of the maze, he needs to get to the (n + 1)-th one.

The maze is organized as follows. Each room of the maze has two one-way portals. Let's consider room number i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), someone can use the first portal to move from it to room number (i + 1), also someone can use the second portal to move from it to room number pi, where 1 ≤ pi ≤ i.

In order not to get lost, Vasya decided to act as follows. 

  * Each time Vasya enters some room, he paints a cross on its ceiling. Initially, Vasya paints a cross at the ceiling of room 1. 
  * Let's assume that Vasya is in room i and has already painted a cross on its ceiling. Then, if the ceiling now contains an odd number of crosses, Vasya uses the second portal (it leads to room pi), otherwise Vasya uses the first portal. 



Help Vasya determine the number of times he needs to use portals to get to room (n + 1) in the end.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 103) — the number of rooms. The second line contains n integers pi (1 ≤ pi ≤ i). Each pi denotes the number of the room, that someone can reach, if he will use the second portal in the i-th room.

Output

Print a single number — the number of portal moves the boy needs to go out of the maze. As the number can be rather large, print it modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the recurrence relation used in `func_2` is incorrect. According to the problem description, Vasya uses the second portal if the current room has an odd number of crosses and the first portal otherwise. However, the provided implementation does not accurately reflect this behavior.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
n = 3
P = [1, 1, 3]
```

According to the problem description, the sequence of moves would be:
1. Start at room 1 (odd crosses, so use second portal to room 1).
2. Room 1 again (even crosses, so use first portal to room 2).
3. Room 2 (odd crosses, so use second portal to room 1).
4. Room 1 again (even crosses, so use first portal to room 2).
5. Room 2 again (even crosses, so use first portal to room 3).

This results in a total of 6 portal moves.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of moves. The calculation in `func_2` does not properly account for the alternating use of portals based on the number of crosses. This can be seen in the loop where the sum is calculated without correctly reflecting the logic of the problem.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this and potentially other cases, leading to a **False** correctness verdict.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a list `p` of length `n`. It calculates the number of portal jumps required for Vasya to get from each room `i` (with an odd number of crosses) to another room with an even number of crosses and back, using the given portal connections defined by `p`. After performing these calculations, it sums up the total number of portal jumps required for all rooms and prints this sum modulo \(1000000007\). The function does not return a value; instead, it directly prints the result. Potential edge cases include invalid input values for `n` or `p`, which the function currently does not handle. If `n` is outside the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\) or any element in `p` does not satisfy \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\), the function will produce unexpected results due to the lack of validation.
