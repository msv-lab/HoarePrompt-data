Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identified a logical error in the program. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_2` indeed uses `1000000000.0 + 7` instead of `1000000007` in multiple places, which can lead to incorrect results due to floating-point arithmetic and type mismatches. Although the provided annotations show that the state of the program and the logic flow are as described, the critical mistake in the modulo operation remains uncorrected. Therefore, the program will not produce the correct output for the given problem description. The correct implementation should use `1000000007` consistently throughout the code to ensure integer arithmetic and correct modulo operations.
