Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. Specifically, the code incorrectly calculates the number of portal jumps required for Vasya to navigate through the maze.

The problem description states that if the ceiling of room `i` contains an odd number of crosses, Vasya should use the second portal to move to room `pi`, and if it contains an even number of crosses, he should use the first portal to move to room `i+1`.

However, the implementation in `func_2` does not accurately reflect this logic. The key issues are:

1. **Incorrect Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence relation used in the `dp` array is incorrect. The current implementation sums `dp[j]` and adds 1 for each `j` in the range `[p[i], i-1]`, which does not match the described behavior. According to the problem, if `i` is odd, Vasya should use the second portal, and if `i` is even, he should use the first portal.

2. **Summation Logic**: The summation logic in the final loop is also incorrect. The summation of `dp[i]` values and adding 1 for each `i` does not reflect the described behavior of moving through the maze.

To fix this, the code should correctly implement the logic of alternating between the second portal and the first portal based on the parity of the current room. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_2(n, p):
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 1:
            dp[i] = (dp[p[i-1]] + 1) % 1000000007
        else:
            dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 1) % 1000000007
    
    print(dp[n])
```

This corrected version initializes `dp[1]` to 1 and iterates through each room, correctly applying the logic based on the parity of the current room. This ensures that the program behaves as described in the problem statement for every potential case.
