Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the recurrence relation used in `func_2` is incorrect. The annotated version shows that the program does not properly alternate between using the first and second portals based on the number of crosses, which is a key requirement according to the problem description. The loop where the sum is calculated does not correctly reflect the alternating use of portals. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and produces incorrect results.
