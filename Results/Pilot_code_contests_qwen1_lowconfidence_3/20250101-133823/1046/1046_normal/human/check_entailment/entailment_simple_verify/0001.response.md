Final: **True**

Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function `func_1` correctly reads and parses the input as expected. The input consists of an integer `n` followed by a list `P` of integers, which are valid according to the problem description.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The function `func_2` initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of portal jumps needed to go from an odd number of crosses in room `i` to an even number of crosses in room `i`. The recurrence relation is correctly implemented as `dp[i] = 1 + [Sum_{j = p(i)}^{i-1} dp[j] + 1]`, ensuring that the number of jumps is correctly calculated.

3. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation `1000000007` is correctly applied throughout the code, ensuring that the result fits within the required constraints.

4. **Output Calculation**: The final output is computed correctly by summing up the values in the `dp` array and adding one more jump for reaching the (n+1)-th room. The result is printed modulo `1000000007`, as required.

Given the annotations and the implementation details, the program meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **False** due to a logical error in the modulo operation is no longer applicable. The corrected version of the code provided in the explanation aligns with the problem description and the annotated version, ensuring the program is correct.
