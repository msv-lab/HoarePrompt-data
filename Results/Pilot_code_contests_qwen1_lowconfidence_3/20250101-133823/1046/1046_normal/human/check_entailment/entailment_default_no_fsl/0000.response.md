Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not accurately simulate Vasya's movement through the maze according to the rules given. The problem description states that Vasya should use the second portal if the number of crosses in the current room is odd, and the first portal otherwise. However, the current implementation in `func_2` does not reflect this logic. Instead, it calculates a sum of `dp` values, which seems to be an attempt to model the transitions between rooms but is not aligned with the problem requirements. This mismatch means the code does not correctly determine the number of portal moves needed for Vasya to exit the maze.
