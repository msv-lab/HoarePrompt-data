You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: One day, little Vasya found himself in a maze consisting of (n + 1) rooms, numbered from 1 to (n + 1). Initially, Vasya is at the first room and to get out of the maze, he needs to get to the (n + 1)-th one.

The maze is organized as follows. Each room of the maze has two one-way portals. Let's consider room number i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), someone can use the first portal to move from it to room number (i + 1), also someone can use the second portal to move from it to room number pi, where 1 ≤ pi ≤ i.

In order not to get lost, Vasya decided to act as follows. 

  * Each time Vasya enters some room, he paints a cross on its ceiling. Initially, Vasya paints a cross at the ceiling of room 1. 
  * Let's assume that Vasya is in room i and has already painted a cross on its ceiling. Then, if the ceiling now contains an odd number of crosses, Vasya uses the second portal (it leads to room pi), otherwise Vasya uses the first portal. 



Help Vasya determine the number of times he needs to use portals to get to room (n + 1) in the end.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 103) — the number of rooms. The second line contains n integers pi (1 ≤ pi ≤ i). Each pi denotes the number of the room, that someone can reach, if he will use the second portal in the i-th room.

Output

Print a single number — the number of portal moves the boy needs to go out of the maze. As the number can be rather large, print it modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

example = func_1(sys.stdin)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    (n, P) = next(example)
    func_2(n, P)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and P is a list of n integers where each integer p_i satisfies 0 ≤ p_i < i.
def func_1(line):
    """Read example from stdin and parse it into the appropriate data structure

    Use in the following way:

    example = example_generator(stdin_generator)
    while True:

    while True:

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `P` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(p_i\) in `P` is one less than the corresponding integer read from the input.

    dp[i] is the number of portal jumps required to start off at room i with an odd
    number of crosses and get back to room i with an even number of crosses.

    Hence the recurrence relation is as follows:

    dp[i] = 1 + [Sum_{j = p(i)}^{i-1} dp[j] + 1]

    This can be read as "the number of portal jumps to get from room i with an odd
    number of crosses to an even number of crosses is equivalent to taking a portal
    jump to room p(i) into an odd number of crosees (+1), getting back into that
    state with an even number of crosses (Sum part).

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
