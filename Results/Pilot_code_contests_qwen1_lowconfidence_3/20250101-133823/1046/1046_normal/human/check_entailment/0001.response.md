Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in the calculation of `portal_jumps`. Specifically, the line `dp[i] = int(portal_jumps % (1000000000.0 + 7))` uses `1000000000.0 + 7` instead of `1000000007`. This will cause a type mismatch and potentially incorrect results due to floating-point arithmetic. Additionally, the final sum calculation also incorrectly uses `1000000000.0 + 7`.

To fix this, replace `1000000000.0 + 7` with `1000000007` throughout the code. Here is the corrected version:

```python
import sys

# Function 1:
def func_1(line):
    while True:
        n = int(next(line).strip())
        P = [int(p_i) - 1 for p_i in next(line).split()]
        yield (n, P)

# Function 2:
def func_2(n, p):
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        portal_jumps = 1
        for j in range(p[i], i):
            portal_jumps += dp[j] % 1000000007
            portal_jumps += 1 % 1000000007
        dp[i] = int(portal_jumps % 1000000007)
    total_pjumps = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total_pjumps += dp[i] % 1000000007
        total_pjumps += 1 % 1000000007
    print(total_pjumps % 1000000007)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    generator = func_1(iter(sys.stdin.read().splitlines()))
    example = next(generator)
    n, P = example
    func_2(n, P)
```

This corrected version ensures that the calculations are performed using integer arithmetic and the correct modulo value.
