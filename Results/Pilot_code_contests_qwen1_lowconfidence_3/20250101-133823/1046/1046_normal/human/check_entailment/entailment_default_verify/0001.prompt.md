You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, little Vasya found himself in a maze consisting of (n + 1) rooms, numbered from 1 to (n + 1). Initially, Vasya is at the first room and to get out of the maze, he needs to get to the (n + 1)-th one.

The maze is organized as follows. Each room of the maze has two one-way portals. Let's consider room number i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), someone can use the first portal to move from it to room number (i + 1), also someone can use the second portal to move from it to room number pi, where 1 ≤ pi ≤ i.

In order not to get lost, Vasya decided to act as follows. 

  * Each time Vasya enters some room, he paints a cross on its ceiling. Initially, Vasya paints a cross at the ceiling of room 1. 
  * Let's assume that Vasya is in room i and has already painted a cross on its ceiling. Then, if the ceiling now contains an odd number of crosses, Vasya uses the second portal (it leads to room pi), otherwise Vasya uses the first portal. 



Help Vasya determine the number of times he needs to use portals to get to room (n + 1) in the end.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 103) — the number of rooms. The second line contains n integers pi (1 ≤ pi ≤ i). Each pi denotes the number of the room, that someone can reach, if he will use the second portal in the i-th room.

Output

Print a single number — the number of portal moves the boy needs to go out of the maze. As the number can be rather large, print it modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in the calculation of `portal_jumps`. Specifically, the line `dp[i] = int(portal_jumps % (1000000000.0 + 7))` uses `1000000000.0 + 7` instead of `1000000007`. This will cause a type mismatch and potentially incorrect results due to floating-point arithmetic. Additionally, the final sum calculation also incorrectly uses `1000000000.0 + 7`.

To fix this, replace `1000000000.0 + 7` with `1000000007` throughout the code. Here is the corrected version:

```python
import sys

# Function 1:
def func_1(line):
    while True:
        n = int(next(line).strip())
        P = [int(p_i) - 1 for p_i in next(line).split()]
        yield (n, P)

# Function 2:
def func_2(n, p):
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        portal_jumps = 1
        for j in range(p[i], i):
            portal_jumps += dp[j] % 1000000007
            portal_jumps += 1 % 1000000007
        dp[i] = int(portal_jumps % 1000000007)
    total_pjumps = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total_pjumps += dp[i] % 1000000007
        total_pjumps += 1 % 1000000007
    print(total_pjumps % 1000000007)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    generator = func_1(iter(sys.stdin.read().splitlines()))
    example = next(generator)
    n, P = example
    func_2(n, P)
```

This corrected version ensures that the calculations are performed using integer arithmetic and the correct modulo value.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a list `p` of length `n`. It calculates the number of portal jumps required for Vasya to get from each room `i` (with an odd number of crosses) to another room with an even number of crosses and back, using the given portal connections defined by `p`. After performing these calculations, it sums up the total number of portal jumps required for all rooms and prints this sum modulo \(1000000007\). The function does not return a value; instead, it directly prints the result. Potential edge cases include invalid input values for `n` or `p`, which the function currently does not handle. If `n` is outside the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\) or any element in `p` does not satisfy \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\), the function will produce unexpected results due to the lack of validation.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
