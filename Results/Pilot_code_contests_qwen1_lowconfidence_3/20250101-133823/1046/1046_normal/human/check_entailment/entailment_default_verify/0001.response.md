Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment indicated that the program was incorrect due to the use of `1000000000.0 + 7` instead of `1000000007` in the modulo operation. However, upon reviewing the revised code and the output hints, it is clear that the program now correctly uses `1000000007` for all modulo operations. The output hints confirm that the function `func_2` correctly calculates the number of portal jumps required for Vasya to exit the maze, printing the result modulo \(1000000007\). Since the program now adheres to the problem description and the output hints validate its functionality, the original assessment should be revised to reflect the program's correctness.
