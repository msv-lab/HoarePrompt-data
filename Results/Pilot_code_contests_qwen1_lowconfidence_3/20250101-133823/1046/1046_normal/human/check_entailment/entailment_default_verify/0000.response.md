Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not implement the logic described in the problem statement. The output hints further clarify that the function `func_2` calculates the number of portal jumps in a manner that does not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the function does not correctly alternate between using the first and second portals based on the parity of the number of crosses in the current room. The provided example and the explanation of the expected behavior versus the actual behavior of the program validate the original assessment. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of **False** is appropriate.
