Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. Specifically, the recurrence relation used in the `func_2` function does not accurately model the process Vasya follows. According to the problem description, Vasya uses the second portal if the current room's ceiling has an odd number of crosses, and the first portal otherwise. However, the provided code calculates the number of portal jumps required to transition between rooms based on an incorrect recurrence relation.

The recurrence relation in the code is:

\[ dp[i] = 1 + \sum_{j=p[i]}^{i-1} (dp[j] + 1) \]

This relation does not correctly reflect Vasya's movement rules. Instead, it appears to calculate the number of portal jumps required to go from a room with an odd number of crosses to a room with an even number of crosses, which is not the intended behavior.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should simulate Vasya's movements according to the specified rules and count the number of portal jumps accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the `func_2` function:

```python
def func_2(n, p):
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            dp[i] = 1
        else:
            if (i - dp[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
                dp[i] = dp[p[i - 1]] + 1
            else:
                dp[i] = dp[p[i - 1]]
    total_pjumps = sum(dp) % (1000000007)
    print(total_pjumps)
```

This corrected version correctly simulates Vasya's movements and counts the number of portal jumps required to exit the maze.
