The function `STR()` reads a single line of input from the user and returns it as a list of strings. This input is expected to consist of a series of pairs (p_i, c_i), where each pair is a string representation of two non-negative integers separated by whitespace. The function does not perform any validation on the input format, so it is assumed that the input adheres to the specified format. If the input does not conform to the expected format, the behavior of the function is undefined.
