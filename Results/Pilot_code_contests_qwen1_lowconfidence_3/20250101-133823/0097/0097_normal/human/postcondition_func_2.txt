The function `INT()` accepts no parameters and reads an integer input from the user. This input is guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to 500 (inclusive). The function then returns this integer. There are no additional actions or conditions performed by the function beyond reading the input and returning it. Potential edge cases include the user providing an input outside the specified range, in which case the behavior is not defined by the provided code; the function will simply return whatever integer is provided by the user.
