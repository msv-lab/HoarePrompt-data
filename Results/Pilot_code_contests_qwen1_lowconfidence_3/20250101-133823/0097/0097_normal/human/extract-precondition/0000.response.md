Precondition: **zero is an integer representing the initial number to accumulate digits into numb, conv is a function to convert characters to their numeric value (assuming ord is used in Python 2 and a lambda function is used in Python 3), and s is a bytes object containing the input stream from stdin.**

However, this precondition does not fully describe the context in which the function is used or its relationship to the problem described. Based on the problem description, we need a function that checks the correctness of Polycarp's level stats. The provided function `func_2` seems unrelated to the problem, as it converts a byte stream into a list of integers. It does not seem to contribute to the validation of the level stats.

Given the context, we should instead focus on a function that would validate the level stats according to the rules provided in the problem description. Here is a potential function and its precondition:

```python
def validate_stats(n, stats):
    prev_plays = 0
    prev_clears = 0
    for p, c in stats:
        if p < prev_plays or c < prev_clears or p - c > 1:
            return "NO"
        prev_plays = p
        prev_clears = c
    return "YES"

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    stats = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    print(validate_stats(n, stats))
```

Precondition: **n is an integer representing the number of moments Polycarp peeked at the stats, and stats is a list of tuples (p_i, c_i) where p_i is the number of plays and c_i is the number of clears at each moment i.**
