The function reads a series of pairs of integers (p_i, c_i) from user input, where each pair is separated by a space and the pairs themselves are separated by newlines. It processes this input to form a tuple containing these pairs in the exact order they were entered. The function does not accept any parameters and returns the resulting tuple. The function handles the input format as specified, ensuring that the pairs are read in chronological order as provided by the user. Potential edge cases include invalid input formats (e.g., non-integer values or incorrect separators), which would result in the function terminating due to the `map` function raising a `ValueError`. If the input strictly follows the format, the function will correctly return a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains two integers (p_i, c_i).
