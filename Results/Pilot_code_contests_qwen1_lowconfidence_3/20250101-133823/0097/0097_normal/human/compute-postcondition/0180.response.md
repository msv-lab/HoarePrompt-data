Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is `zz[n-1][0]` if the loop ran at least once, `prevClr` is `zz[n-1][1]` if the loop ran at least once, and the console prints 'YES' if no conditions were violated during any iteration, otherwise prints 'NO'.**
