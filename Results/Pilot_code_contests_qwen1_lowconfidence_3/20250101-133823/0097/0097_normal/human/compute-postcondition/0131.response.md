The variable `prevplay` is assigned the value `0`. The initial value of `n` is a non-negative integer, and `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists. After executing the line `prevplay = 0`, the value of `n` and the structure of `zz` remain unchanged, but `prevplay` is now explicitly set to `0`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is 0**
