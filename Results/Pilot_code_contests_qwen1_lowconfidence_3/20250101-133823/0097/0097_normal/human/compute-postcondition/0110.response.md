Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `zz` contains exactly `n` elements, `prevplay` is `zz[0][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `flag` is 1, `temp` is `zz[2][1] - zz[1][1]`, `temp1` is `zz[2][0] - zz[0][0]`, and if `temp > temp1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `temp <= temp1`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
