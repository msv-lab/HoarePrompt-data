`temp` is assigned the value of `zz[i][1] - prevClr`. Given that `prevClr` is 0, `temp` becomes `zz[i][1] - 0`, which simplifies to `zz[i][1]`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `zz`, `prevplay`, `prevClr`, and `flag`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `zz` contains exactly `n` elements, `prevplay` is 0, `prevClr` is 0, and `flag` is 0, `temp` is equal to `zz[i][1]`**
