Let's break down the given program state and the `while True` loop step by step.

### Given Information
- `s` is a sequence containing its original elements.
- `sign` is -1 if `s[i]` is equal to the value of `'-'[0]`, otherwise `sign` is 1.
- `numb` is calculated as follows:
  - If `s[i]` is greater than or equal to `'0'[0]`, then `numb` is updated as `10 * numb + conv(s[i]) - 48`.
  - Otherwise, `numb` is set to 0.
- Variable `i` is increased by 1.

### Understanding the Loop
The `while True` loop will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Therefore, there are no specific conditions to check for the continuation of the loop.

### Adjusting the States
Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute again unless the loop is explicitly broken. The only thing we need to consider is the current state of the loop variables, particularly `i`.

- The sequence `s` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted.
- The value of `sign` and `numb` depend on the value of `s[i]` and the condition in the loop body.
- The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration.

Given that the loop will always execute again, the only state that needs adjustment is the increment of `i`.

### Final Answer
State: **`s` is a sequence containing its original elements, `sign` is -1 if `s[i]` is equal to the value of `'-'[0]`, otherwise `sign` is 1; `numb` is 10 * `numb` + `conv(s[i])` - 48 if `s[i]` is greater than or equal to `'0'[0]`, otherwise `numb` is 0; `i` is increased by 1**
