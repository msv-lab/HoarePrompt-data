`A.append(sign * numb)` appends the value of `sign * numb` to the list `A`. Given the initial state, `numb` is equal to `zero`, `sign` is 1, and `numb` is multiplied by `sign`. Since `sign` is 1, `sign * numb` is just `numb`, which is `zero`. Therefore, the list `A` will have the value `zero` appended to it.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `zero` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty bytes object, `conv` is either `ord` if `py2` is true or a lambda function if `py2` is false, `A` is an empty list with one element `0`, `numb` is equal to `zero`, `sign` is 1, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is less than `b'0'[0]`, and `s[i]` is not equal to `b'\r'[0]`.

Output State: **`zero` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty bytes object, `conv` is either `ord` if `py2` is true or a lambda function if `py2` is false, `A` is `[0]`, `numb` is equal to `zero`, `sign` is 1, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is less than `b'0'[0]`, and `s[i]` is not equal to `b'\r'[0]**.
