Postcondition: ***`s` is a sequence containing its original elements, `i` is incremented by 1, `sign` is 1, and `numb` is updated according to the value of `s[i]`: if `s[i]` is greater than or equal to `'0'[0]`, `numb` is updated as `10 * numb + conv(s[i]) - 48`; otherwise, `numb` remains unchanged at 0. If `s[i]` is not equal to `b'\r'[0]`, `A` is set to 0.***
