`sign` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `sign` is now explicitly set to `1`, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `sign`.

Output State: **`zero` is an integer representing the initial number to accumulate digits into `numb`; `s` is a bytes object containing the input stream from stdin; `conv` is either `ord` if `py2` is true or a lambda function `lambda x: x` if `py2` is false; `A` is an empty list; `numb` is equal to `zero`; `sign` is 1.**
