The code `break` does not affect any variable values; it only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no such loop or conditional statement is present in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `zz` contains exactly `n` elements, `prevplay` is `zz[0][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `flag` is 1, `temp` remains unchanged, and `temp1` remains unchanged**
