Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is `zz[1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `n` must be greater than 2. If `zz[i][0] < prevplay` or `zz[i][1] < prevClr` or `zz[i][0] < zz[i][1]` is true, the condition is satisfied as stated. Otherwise, the condition is not specified to change any variables' values, so they remain the same.***
