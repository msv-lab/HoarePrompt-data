The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the empty parameter list. Given the constraints, the function is expected to handle some internal state or external data that is not provided through parameters but rather through its environment or previous calls.

However, based on the output cases provided, we can infer that the function processes some kind of data structured as pairs `(p_i, c_i)` where both `p_i` and `c_i` are integers within specified ranges and are provided in chronological order. The function then returns a value based on the processing of these pairs.

Since no specific output is given for different scenarios, we can only describe what the function should accept and what it returns based on the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, processes a series of pairs `(p_i, c_i)` where `p_i` and `c_i` are integers, and returns a value based on the processing of these pairs.**
