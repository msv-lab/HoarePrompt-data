`zz.append(LIST())` appends an empty list to the end of the list `zz`. Since `zz` originally contained at least three elements, with the last element being an empty list, after appending another empty list, the last element of `zz` will now be an empty list followed by another empty list. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `zz` contains at least four elements, with the last two elements being empty lists**
