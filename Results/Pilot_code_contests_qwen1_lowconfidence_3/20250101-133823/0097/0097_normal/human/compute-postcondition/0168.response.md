The code `break` does not affect any variables and simply exits the loop or the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is `zz[1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `n` is greater than 2, `temp` is `zz[2][1] - zz[1][1]`, `temp1` is `zz[2][0] - zz[1][0]`**
