The code changes the value of `sign` from 1 to -1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`zero` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty bytes object, `conv` is either `ord` if `py2` is true or a lambda function if `py2` is false, `A` is an empty list, `numb` is equal to `zero`, `sign` is -1, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is equal to `b'-'[0]`**
