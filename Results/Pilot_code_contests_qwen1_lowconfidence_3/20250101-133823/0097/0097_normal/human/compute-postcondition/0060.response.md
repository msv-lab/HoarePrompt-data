Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `INF` is infinity, `mod` is 1000000007, `t` is a non-zero integer input, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is the last value of `zz[i][0]` that was checked, `prevClr` is the last value of `zz[i][1]` that was checked, and the console prints either 'NO' if at least one of the conditions in the `if` statements was met during any iteration, or 'YES' otherwise.***
