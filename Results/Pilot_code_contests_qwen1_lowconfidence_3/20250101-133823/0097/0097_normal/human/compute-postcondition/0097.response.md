The code `break` is executed without changing any variables. It simply breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement it is within. However, since there is no loop or if statement context given, we assume it breaks out of an implied loop or if statement. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `zz` contains exactly `n` elements, `prevplay` is `zz[0][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `flag` is 1, `temp` is `zz[i][1] - zz[1][1]`, `temp1` is `zz[1][0] - zz[0][0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
