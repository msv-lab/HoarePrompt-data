Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is `zz[1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `n` is greater than 2. If `temp` (which is `zz[2][1] - zz[1][1]`) is greater than `temp1` (which is `zz[2][0] - zz[1][0]`), the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the condition in the if statement.***
