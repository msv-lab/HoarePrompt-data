`temp` is assigned the value of `zz[i][1] - prevClr`. The value of `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, so `temp` becomes `zz[i][1] - zz[1][1]`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `zz` contains exactly `n` elements, `prevplay` is `zz[0][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `flag` is 1, and `temp` is `zz[i][1] - zz[1][1]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `zz` contains exactly `n` elements, `prevplay` is `zz[0][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `flag` is 1, and `temp` is `zz[i][1] - zz[1][1]`**
