The code `break` is used to exit a loop or match statement. In this case, since there is no loop or match statement in the provided code, the variables `i` and `flag` remain unchanged. However, we include the fact that the code breaks out of the hypothetical loop or match statement it was inside.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `flag` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or match statement.**
