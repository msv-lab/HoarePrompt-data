Functionality: **The function `func_2` takes an integer `zero` as a parameter and processes a bytes object `s` to extract numbers from it. It accumulates these numbers into a list `A`, excluding any segments that start with `\r`. If the last character of `s` is a digit (i.e., greater than or equal to `b'0'[0]`), it appends `sign * numb` to `A`, where `numb` is the integer representation of the number formed by the digits in `s`, and `sign` is either 1 or -1 depending on whether `s` starts with a `-`. The function ultimately returns the list `A` containing all the extracted numbers.**

This summary includes the following key points:
- The function processes the input bytes object `s` to form numbers from its segments.
- Segments starting with `\r` are excluded.
- The function keeps track of the accumulated number in `numb` and its sign in `sign`.
- If the last character of `s` is a digit, `sign * numb` is appended to `A`.
- The function handles the case where the input `s` might be empty or contain no valid number segments.
- The function correctly manages the sign of the accumulated number based on the presence of a leading `-` in `s`.
