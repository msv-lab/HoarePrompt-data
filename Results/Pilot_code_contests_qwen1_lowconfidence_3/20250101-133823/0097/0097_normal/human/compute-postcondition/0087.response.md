Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `zz` contains exactly `n` elements, `prevplay` is 0, `prevClr` is 0, and `flag` is 1 if `zz[i][1]` is greater than `prevClr`, otherwise the values of `n`, `i`, `zz`, `prevplay`, `prevClr`, and `flag` remain unchanged. Additionally, `temp` is equal to `zz[i][1]` and is now greater than `temp1`, and `temp1` is equal to `zz[0][0]` if the condition is met.***
