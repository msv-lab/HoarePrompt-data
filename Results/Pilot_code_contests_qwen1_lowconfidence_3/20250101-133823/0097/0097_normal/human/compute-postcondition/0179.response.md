`t` is decremented by 1, but the initial value of `t` is not specified. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is `zz[n-1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[n-1][1]`, and `t` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is `zz[n-1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[n-1][1]`, `t` is decreased by 1**
