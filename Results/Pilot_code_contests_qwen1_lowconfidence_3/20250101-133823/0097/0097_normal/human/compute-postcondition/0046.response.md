Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty bytes object, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `sign` is -1 if the first character of `s` was `b'-'[0]`, otherwise `sign` is 1, `numb` is the integer representation of the number formed by the digits in `s` (ignoring any leading '-' sign), `zero` remains unchanged, `A` contains all the numbers formed from the segments in `s` (excluding any segments that start with `\r`), and `conv` remains unchanged. If the last character of `s` is greater than or equal to `b'0'[0]`, then `sign * numb` is appended to `A`.***
