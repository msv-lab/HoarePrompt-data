`zz.append(LIST())` adds a new list to the `zz` variable. Since `zz` must have at least one element in the initial state, after appending a new list, `zz` will now contain at least two elements, with the last element being a new empty list. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `zz` contains at least two elements, with the last element being an empty list**
