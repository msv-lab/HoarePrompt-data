Postcondition: ***`s` is a sequence containing its original elements, `i` is incremented by 1, `sign` is -1 if `s[i-1]` is equal to `b'-'[0]`, otherwise `sign` is 1, `numb` is updated as follows: if `s[i-1]` is greater than or equal to `'0'[0]`, `numb` is updated as `10 * numb + conv(s[i-1]) - 48`; otherwise, `numb` is 0. If `s[i-1]` is not equal to `b'\r'[0]`, `A` is set to 0.***
