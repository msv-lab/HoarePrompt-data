Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `zz` contains exactly `n` elements, `prevplay` is `zz[0][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `flag` is 1. If `zz[i][1] > prevClr`, then `temp` is `zz[i][1] - zz[1][1]`, `temp1` is `zz[1][0] - zz[0][0]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. If `temp > temp1`, then the comparison is satisfied; otherwise, the condition is not met. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `i`, `zz`, `prevplay`, `prevClr`, `flag`, `temp`, and `temp1` remain unchanged.***
