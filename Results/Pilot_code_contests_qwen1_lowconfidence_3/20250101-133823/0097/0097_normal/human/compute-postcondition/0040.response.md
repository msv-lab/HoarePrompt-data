The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The values of `s`, `sign`, and `numb` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`s` is a sequence containing its original elements, `i` is incremented by 1, `sign` is -1 if `s[i-1]` is equal to `b'-'[0]`, otherwise `sign` is 1, `numb` is updated as follows: if `s[i-1]` is greater than or equal to `'0'[0]`, `numb` is updated as `10 * numb + conv(s[i-1]) - 48`; otherwise, `numb` is 0.**
