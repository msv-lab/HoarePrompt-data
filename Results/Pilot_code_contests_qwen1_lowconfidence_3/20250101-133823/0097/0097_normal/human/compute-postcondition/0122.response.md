The code `n = INT()` does not specify what `INT()` is. For the sake of this example, let's assume `INT()` is meant to represent `int(input())`, which would take an input from the user and convert it to an integer.

Given the initial state where `flag` is 1 and `t` must be greater than 0, the variable `n` is assigned the value of an integer input from the user. The variables `flag` and `t` remain unchanged unless specified otherwise by the input.

Output State: **`flag` is 1; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer**
