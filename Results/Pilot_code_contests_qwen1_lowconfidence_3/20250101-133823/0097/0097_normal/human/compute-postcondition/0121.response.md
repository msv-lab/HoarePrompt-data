According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has been decreased by 1, so `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `flag` is 1
- `t` is decreased by 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`flag` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0**
