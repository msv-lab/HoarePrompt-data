Postcondition: ***`zero` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty bytes object, `conv` is either `ord` if `py2` is true or a lambda function if `py2` is false, `A` is `[0]`, `numb` is equal to `zero`, `sign` is 1, `i` is 0, and `s[i]` is less than `b'0'[0]`. If `s[i]` is not equal to `b'\r'[0], then `A` remains `[0]`. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables.***
