The variable `prevClr` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `zz`, and `prevplay`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be a positive integer; `zz` contains exactly `n` elements, each of which is an empty list; `prevplay` is 0; `prevClr` is 0.

Output State: **`n` must be a positive integer; `zz` contains exactly `n` elements, each of which is an empty list; `prevplay` is 0; `prevClr` is 0.**
