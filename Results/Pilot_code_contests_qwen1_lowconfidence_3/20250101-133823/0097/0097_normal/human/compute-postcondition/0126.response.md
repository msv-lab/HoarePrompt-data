According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `n` still satisfies this condition.

However, since `n` is a single value and there are no operations modifying it within the loop (as indicated by `_` being used as the iterator variable), `n` remains unchanged from its initial state if no modifications occur inside the loop body.

Thus, the state does not change for `n` as it is not modified within the loop. The only thing we need to confirm is that `n` is still greater than 0.

The list `zz` containing one empty list remains unchanged as well.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `zz` is a list containing one empty list**
