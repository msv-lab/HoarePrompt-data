`temp1` is assigned the value `zz[i][0] - prevplay`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `zz[i][0]` is `zz[1][0]`. The value of `prevplay` is `zz[0][0]`. Therefore, `temp1` is calculated as `zz[1][0] - zz[0][0]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `zz` contains exactly `n` elements, `prevplay` is `zz[0][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `flag` is 1, `temp` is `zz[i][1] - zz[1][1]`, `temp1` is `zz[1][0] - zz[0][0]`**
