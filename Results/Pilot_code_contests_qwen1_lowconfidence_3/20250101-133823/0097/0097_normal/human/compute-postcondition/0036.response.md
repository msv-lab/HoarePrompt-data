The code sets `sign` to 1. The initial values of the variables are `A` is updated with `sign * numb`, `i` is i + 1, `sign` is -1, and `numb` is 0. Since `A` was updated with `sign * numb`, and `numb` is 0, the value of `A` remains unchanged (0). The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `sign` is now 1. 

Output State: **`A` is 0, `i` is i + 1, `sign` is 1**
