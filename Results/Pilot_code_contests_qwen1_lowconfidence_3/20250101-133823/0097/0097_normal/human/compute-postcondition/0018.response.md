Postcondition: ***`zero` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty bytes object, `conv` is either `ord` if `py2` is true or a lambda function if `py2` is false, `A` is either `[0]` or an empty list, `numb` is equal to `zero`, `sign` is -1 if the first character of `s` is `b'-'[0]`, and `sign` is 1 otherwise. `i` is 0, and `s[i]` is less than `b'0'[0]`.***
