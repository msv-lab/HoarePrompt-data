Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `zz` contains exactly `n` elements, `prevplay` is `zz[0][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `flag` is 1, `temp` remains unchanged, and `temp1` remains unchanged. If `zz[i][0] < prevplay` or `zz[i][1] < prevClr` or `zz[i][0] < zz[i][1]` is true, the condition is met as is. If none of these conditions are true, the condition remains unchanged.***
