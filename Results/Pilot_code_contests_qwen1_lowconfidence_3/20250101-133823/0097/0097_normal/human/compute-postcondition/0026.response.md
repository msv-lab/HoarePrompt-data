`sign` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `numb` is now `0`, and `sign` is unchanged from its previous state. Therefore, the output state is: `A` contains its original elements plus `sign * numb`, which simplifies to `A` contains its original elements plus `1 * 0` (since `numb` is `0`), `sign` is `1`, and `numb` is `0`.

Output State: **`A` contains its original elements, `sign` is 1, `numb` is 0**
