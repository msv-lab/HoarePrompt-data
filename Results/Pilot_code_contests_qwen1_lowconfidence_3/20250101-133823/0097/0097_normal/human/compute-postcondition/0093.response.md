Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `zz` contains exactly `n` elements, `prevplay` is `zz[0][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `flag` is 1, and if `zz[i][0] < prevplay` or `zz[i][1] < prevClr` or `zz[i][0] < zz[i][1]` holds true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `i`, `zz`, `prevplay`, and `flag` remain unchanged.***
