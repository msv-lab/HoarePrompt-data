The code `break` does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or match-case statement. Since there is no loop or match-case statement in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged after executing the `break` statement.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `flag` is 1, `temp` is `zz[1][1] - prevClr`, `temp1` is `zz[1][0] - prevplay`, we break out of the most internal loop or match-case statement.**
