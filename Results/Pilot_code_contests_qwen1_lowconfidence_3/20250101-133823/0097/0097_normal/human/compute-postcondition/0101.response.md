The code `prevClr = zz[i][1]` updates the value of `prevClr` to be the value of `zz[i][1]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, `prevClr` is initially `zz[1][1]`, and `i` is 1, the new value of `prevClr` will be `zz[1][1]`.

Since no other variables are affected by this line of code, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `zz` contains exactly `n` elements, `prevplay` is `zz[0][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `flag` is 1, `temp` remains unchanged, and `temp1` remains unchanged.**
