The code snippet `print('YES')` does not affect any variables or change their values. It simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the only change is in the output that is printed, but this does not alter the values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `INF` is infinity, `mod` is 1000000007, `t` is a non-zero integer input, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is the last value of `zz[i][0]` that was checked, `prevClr` is the last value of `zz[i][1]` that was checked, `flag` is 0; the program prints 'YES'**
