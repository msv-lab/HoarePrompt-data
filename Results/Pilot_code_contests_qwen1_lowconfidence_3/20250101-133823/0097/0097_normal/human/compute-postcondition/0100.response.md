The code assigns the value of `zz[i][0]` to `prevplay`. According to the initial state, `i` is 1, so `zz[i][0]` is equivalent to `zz[1][0]`. The value of `zz[1][0]` is `prevplay`. Therefore, `prevplay` remains the same as its previous value.

All other variables (`n`, `i`, `zz`, `prevClr`, `flag`, `temp`, and `temp1`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `zz` contains exactly `n` elements, `prevplay` is `zz[0][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `flag` is 1, `temp` remains unchanged, and `temp1` remains unchanged.**
