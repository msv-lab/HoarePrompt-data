Output State: **`A` is updated with `sign * numb`, `i` is i + 1, `sign` is -1, `numb` is 0**.

Explanation:
- The code snippet `A.append(sign * numb)` appends the value of `sign * numb` to the list `A`.
- Before the code execution, `sign` is -1 because `s[i]` is equal to `'-'[0]` (which is -48).
- `numb` is initialized to 0.
- After executing `A.append(sign * numb)`, `A` is updated with the value `sign * numb`, which is `-1 * 0 = 0`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
- Since `sign` was determined to be -1, it remains -1.
- `numb` remains 0 because no new characters have been processed yet (as indicated by the final line `numb = zero`).

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `A` is updated with `0`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `sign` is -1.
- `numb` is 0.
