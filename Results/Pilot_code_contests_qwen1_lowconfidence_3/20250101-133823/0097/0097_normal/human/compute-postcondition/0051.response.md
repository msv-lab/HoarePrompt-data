Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0; `INF` is infinity; `mod` is 1000000007; `t` is a non-zero integer input; `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists; `prevplay` is now `zz[i_current + 1][0]`; `prevClr` is now `zz[i_current + 1][1]`; `flag` remains 1 unless `zz[i_current + 1][0] >= prevplay`, `zz[i_current + 1][1] >= prevClr`, and `zz[i_current + 1][0] >= zz[i_current + 1][1]`, in which case `flag` becomes 0; `temp` is now `zz[i][1] - prevClr`; `temp1` is now `zz[i][0] - prevplay`. If `temp > temp1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
