Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `zz` contains exactly `n` elements, `prevplay` is `zz[0][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `flag` is 1, `temp` remains unchanged (or `temp = zz[2][1] - zz[1][1]` if `zz[i][1] > prevClr`), `temp1` remains unchanged (or `temp1 = zz[2][0] - zz[0][0]` if `zz[i][1] > prevClr`), and if `zz[i][1] > prevClr`, the most internal loop or if statement breaks. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.***
