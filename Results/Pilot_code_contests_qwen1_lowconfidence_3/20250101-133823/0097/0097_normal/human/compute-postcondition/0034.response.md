The code snippet `A.append(sign * numb)` appends the value of `sign * numb` to the list `A`. To determine the updated values of the variables, we need to consider the current values of `sign`, `numb`, and `i`.

Given:
- `sign` is determined by whether `s[i]` is equal to `'-'[0]` (which is -48).
- `numb` is updated based on whether `s[i]` is greater than or equal to `'0'[0]` (which is 48).

Let's denote the current value of `s[i]` as `ch`.

1. If `ch == '-'[0]` (i.e., `ch == -48`):
   - `sign` will be `-1`.
   - `numb` remains unchanged from its previous value.

2. If `ch >= '0'[0]` (i.e., `ch >= 48`):
   - `sign` will be `1`.
   - `numb` will be updated to `10 * numb + conv(s[i]) - 48`, where `conv(s[i])` is the numeric value of the character `s[i]`.

3. In both cases, `i` is incremented by 1.

After executing `A.append(sign * numb)`, the following updates occur:
- `A` is appended with the value `sign * numb`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Since the exact value of `s[i]` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `numb` or `sign` without knowing the character `s[i]`. However, the general state after the code execution can be described as follows:

- `A` has been modified by appending `sign * numb`.
- `i` has been incremented by 1.
- `sign` and `numb` retain their last known values before the operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`A` is updated with `sign * numb`, `i` is i + 1, `sign` is -1 if `s[i]` is equal to `'-'[0]`, otherwise `sign` is 1; `numb` is 10 * `numb` + `conv(s[i])` - 48 if `s[i]` is greater than or equal to `'0'[0]`, otherwise `numb` is 0.**
