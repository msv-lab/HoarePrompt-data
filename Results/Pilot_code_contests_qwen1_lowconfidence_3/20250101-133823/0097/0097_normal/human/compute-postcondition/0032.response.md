The code snippet updates the value of `numb` by multiplying the current value of `numb` by 10 and adding the converted numeric value of `s[i]` (subtracting 48) to it. However, the initial values of `numb` and `s[i]` are not explicitly given. Since `numb` is updated based on the character at index `i` in the sequence `s`, let's consider the general case.

Let's assume the initial state:
- `s` is a sequence containing its original elements.
- `sign` is determined by the value of `s[i]` being equal to `'-'[0]` (which is 45). So, if `s[i] == '-'`, `sign` is -1, otherwise, `sign` is 1.
- `numb` is updated by the formula `10 * numb + conv(s[i]) - 48` if `s[i]` is greater than or equal to `'0'[0]` (which is 48). Otherwise, `numb` is set to 0.
- `i` is increased by 1.

The code snippet `numb = 10 * numb + conv(s[i]) - 48` directly updates `numb`. The previous value of `numb` and the value of `s[i]` are used to determine the new value of `numb`.

Since the exact value of `numb` and `s[i]` is not specified, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer. However, the general state after the code execution would be:

- `numb` is updated according to the formula.
- `i` is increased by 1.
- The value of `sign` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`numb` is updated according to `10 * numb + conv(s[i]) - 48`, `i` is increased by 1, and `sign` is -1 if `s[i]` is equal to `'-'[0]`, otherwise `sign` is 1.**
