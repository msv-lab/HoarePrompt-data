Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State**:
   - `zero` is an integer representing the initial number to accumulate digits into `numb`.
   - `s` is a bytes object containing the newly read input stream from stdin.
   - `conv` is either `ord` if `py2` is true or a lambda function `lambda x: x` if `py2` is false.
   - `A` is an empty list.
   - `numb` is equal to `zero`.
   - `sign` is 1.
   - `i` is 0.

2. **Code for the try except block**:
   ```python
   try:
       while True:
           if s[i] >= b'0'[0]:
               numb = 10 * numb + conv(s[i]) - 48
           elif s[i] == b'-'[0]:
               sign = -1
           elif s[i] != b'\r'[0]:
               A.append(sign * numb)
               numb = zero
               sign = 1
           i += 1
   except:
       pass
   ```

3. **Execution Flow**:
   - The `while True` loop runs until an exception is raised.
   - The loop processes each byte in the `s` bytes object.
   - If the current byte is a digit (`b'0'` to `b'9'`), it updates `numb` to form an integer.
   - If the current byte is a `-`, it sets `sign` to -1.
   - If the current byte is neither a digit nor a newline (`b'\r'`), it appends the current `numb` (multiplied by `sign`) to `A` and resets `numb` to `zero` and `sign` to 1.
   - If any other byte is encountered, the loop continues processing.

4. **Potential Exceptions**:
   - The only potential exception in this code is if the index `i` goes out of bounds of the `s` bytes object. This would happen if the loop attempts to access a byte beyond the last index of `s`.

5. **Output State After Execution of the try Statement**:
   - `s` is a non-empty bytes object.
   - `i` is equal to the length of `s`.
   - `sign` is -1 if the first character of `s` was `b'-'[0]`, otherwise `sign` is 1.
   - `numb` is the integer representation of the number formed by the digits in `s` (ignoring any leading '-' sign).
   - `zero` remains unchanged.
   - `A` contains all the numbers formed from the segments in `s` (excluding any segments that start with `\r`).
   - `conv` remains unchanged.

6. **Output State After Execution of the except Statement(s)**:
   - Since the `except` block is a bare `pass`, the state remains unchanged regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.

### Summary

- **Exception**: An exception could occur if `i` exceeds the length of `s`, but since the `except` block is a bare `pass`, no specific action is taken when this happens.
- **What the try except statement accomplishes**: It processes the bytes object `s` to extract numbers and signs, ignoring any segments starting with `\r`, and stores them in the list `A`.
- **Final Output State**: `s` is a non-empty bytes object, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `sign` is -1 if the first character of `s` was `b'-'[0]`, otherwise `sign` is 1, `numb` is the integer representation of the number formed by the digits in `s` (ignoring any leading '-' sign), `zero` remains unchanged, `A` contains all the numbers formed from the segments in `s` (excluding any segments that start with `\r`), and `conv` remains unchanged.

### Final Output State

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty bytes object, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `sign` is -1 if the first character of `s` was `b'-'[0]`, otherwise `sign` is 1, `numb` is the integer representation of the number formed by the digits in `s` (ignoring any leading '-' sign), `zero` remains unchanged, `A` contains all the numbers formed from the segments in `s` (excluding any segments that start with `\r`), and `conv` remains unchanged.**
