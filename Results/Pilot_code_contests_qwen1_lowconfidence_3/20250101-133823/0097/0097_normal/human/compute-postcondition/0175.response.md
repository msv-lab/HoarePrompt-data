The code `print('NO')` does not affect any variables; it only prints 'NO' to the console. Therefore, the only change is in the output of the program, which is 'NO', but the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is `zz[n-1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[n-1][1]`, `flag` is 1, and the output is 'NO'.**
