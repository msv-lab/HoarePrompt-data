`zz.append(LIST())` appends an empty list (denoted by `LIST()`) to the `zz` list. The value of `n` is not affected, and no new variables are introduced. Therefore, the only change is that an empty list is added to `zz`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `zz` is a list containing one empty list**
