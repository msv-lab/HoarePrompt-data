The line `flag = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `flag`. The other variables (`i`, `prevplay`, `prevClr`, `n`, `temp`, `temp1`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is `zz[1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `n` is greater than 2, `temp` is `zz[2][1] - zz[1][1]`, `temp1` is `zz[2][0] - zz[1][0]`**
