The variable `flag` is assigned the value `1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `zz` contains exactly `n` elements, `prevplay` is 0, `prevClr` is 0, `flag` is 1, `temp` is equal to `zz[i][1]` and currently greater than `temp1`, `temp1` is equal to `zz[0][0]`.
