Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `zz` contains exactly `n` elements, `prevplay` is 0, `prevClr` is 0. If `zz[i][0]` is less than `prevplay` (which is 0), `zz[i][1]` is less than `prevClr` (which is 0), or `zz[i][0]` is less than `zz[i][1]`, then `flag` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `i`, `zz`, `prevplay`, `prevClr`, and `flag` remain unchanged.***
