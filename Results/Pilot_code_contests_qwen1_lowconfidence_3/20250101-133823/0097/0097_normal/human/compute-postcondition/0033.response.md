The initial value of `sign` is set to -1, which means that `s[i]` is equal to `'-'[0]`. The value of `numb` is calculated based on the condition `s[i] >= '0'[0]`. Since `i` is increased by 1 in the initial state, `s[i]` is now the next element in the sequence `s`. The code simply assigns `-1` to `sign`, which does not depend on the current value of `s[i]` or any other variables.

Therefore, the value of `sign` changes to -1, and the values of `numb` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sign` is -1, `numb` is 10 * `numb` + `conv(s[i])` - 48 if `s[i]` is greater than or equal to `'0'[0]`, otherwise `numb` is 0; `i` is increased by 1**
