`temp1` is assigned the value of `zz[i][0] - prevplay`. Given that `i` is 1, the expression becomes `zz[1][0] - prevplay`. The value of `temp` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the updated values are `i` is 1, `flag` is 1, `temp` is `zz[1][1] - prevClr`, and `temp1` is `zz[1][0] - prevplay`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `flag` is 1, `temp` is `zz[1][1] - prevClr`, `temp1` is `zz[1][0] - prevplay`**
