The code `A.append(sign * numb)` appends the value of `sign * numb` to the list `A`. However, since the initial values of `sign` and `numb` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value that will be appended to `A`. But we know that `A` will receive this new value.

Output State: **`A` contains its original elements plus `sign * numb`, `sign` is unchanged, `numb` is unchanged**
