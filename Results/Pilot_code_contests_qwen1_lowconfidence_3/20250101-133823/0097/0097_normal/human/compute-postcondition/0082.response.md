`temp1` is assigned the value of `zz[i][0] - prevplay`. Given that `i` is 0, `zz[0][0]` is the first element of the first sublist in `zz`, and `prevplay` is 0, `temp1` becomes `zz[0][0] - 0`, which simplifies to `zz[0][0]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `zz` contains exactly `n` elements, `prevplay` is 0, `prevClr` is 0, `flag` is 0, `temp` is equal to `zz[i][1]`, and `temp1` is equal to `zz[0][0]`.
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `zz` contains exactly `n` elements, `prevplay` is 0, `prevClr` is 0, `flag` is 0, `temp` is equal to `zz[i][1]`, and `temp1` is equal to `zz[0][0]`.**
