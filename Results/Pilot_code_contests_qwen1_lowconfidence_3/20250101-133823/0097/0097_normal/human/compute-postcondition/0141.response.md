`temp1` is assigned the value of `zz[i][0] - prevplay`. The value of `zz[i][0]` is unknown, but it will be subtracted by `prevplay`, which is 0. Therefore, `temp1` will be equal to `zz[i][0]`.

The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. So, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0; `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists; `prevplay` is 0; `prevClr` is 0; `flag` is 1; `temp` is a positive value equal to `zz[i][1] - 0`; `temp1` is equal to `zz[i][0]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists; `prevplay` is 0; `prevClr` is 0; `flag` is 1; `temp` is a positive value equal to `zz[i][1] - 0`; `temp1` is equal to `zz[i][0]`.**
