The code `zz = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `zz`. This means that the previous value of `zz` (a list containing `n` empty lists) is replaced with an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `INF` is infinity, `mod` is 1000000007, `t` is a non-zero integer input - 2, `zz` is an empty list, `prevplay` is the last value of `zz[i][0]` that was checked, `prevClr` is the last value of `zz[i][1]` that was checked, and the console prints either 'NO' if at least one of the conditions in the `if` statements was met during any iteration, or 'YES' otherwise.**
