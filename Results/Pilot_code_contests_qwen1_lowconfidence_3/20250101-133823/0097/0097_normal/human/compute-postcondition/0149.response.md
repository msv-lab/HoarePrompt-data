Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify Initial States:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists.
   - `prevplay` is `zz[i][0]`.
   - `prevClr` is `zz[i][1]`.
   - `flag` is 1.

2. **Understand the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning it runs from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Determine Changes After One Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each time, after one iteration, `i` will be `1`.
   - `prevplay` will now be `zz[1][0]`.
   - `prevClr` will now be `zz[1][1]`.

4. **Check Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Update States:**
   - `n` remains unchanged (must still be greater than 0).
   - `zz` remains unchanged (still contains `n` empty lists).
   - `prevplay` becomes `zz[1][0]`.
   - `prevClr` becomes `zz[1][1]`.
   - `flag` remains unchanged (is still 1).

6. **Formulate the New State:**
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be `1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `n` must be greater than 1; `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists; `prevplay` is `zz[1][0]`; `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`; `flag` is 1**.
