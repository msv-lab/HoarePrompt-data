The function `sortListWithIndex` accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains at least two integers, and an integer index `idx`. It returns a new list of tuples sorted based on the value at the specified index within each tuple. The function does not modify the original list. Potential edge cases include empty lists, lists with only one tuple, or invalid indices (e.g., indices that exceed the length of the tuples). The function correctly sorts the list based on the provided index, but it does not handle these edge cases explicitly in the given code.
