Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly validate the input data to ensure that the sequence of pairs \((p_i, c_i)\) is valid according to the problem description. Specifically, the code does not handle cases where the number of plays decreases between two consecutive moments, which is not allowed. For example, consider the following input:

```
3
10 1
15 2
10 2
```

In this case, the number of plays decreases from 15 to 10 between the second and third moments, which is not possible since the number of plays cannot decrease. The code does not detect this issue and would incorrectly print "YES" for this input.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that the number of plays never decreases between two consecutive moments. The correct approach would be to check that \(p_{i+1} \geq p_i\) for all \(i\).
