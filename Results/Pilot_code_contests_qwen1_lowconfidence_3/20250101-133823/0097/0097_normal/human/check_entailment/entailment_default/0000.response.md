Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly validate the sequence of pairs \((p_i, c_i)\) to ensure that the number of plays is always greater than or equal to the number of clears at any point in time. Specifically, the code does not handle the case where the number of plays decreases after an increase in the number of clears. Here is an example where the program fails:

Consider the sequence of pairs:
- \((10, 1)\)
- \((15, 2)\)
- \((10, 2)\)
- \((15, 2)\)

According to the problem description, the number of plays should never decrease. However, the sequence \((10, 1)\) to \((10, 2)\) is valid, but the transition from \((15, 2)\) to \((10, 2)\) is not, as the number of plays decreases from 15 to 10 without an intervening increase in the number of clears.

The code in `func_1` does not enforce this constraint properly. It only checks if the current number of plays is less than the previous number of plays and if the current number of clears is less than the previous number of clears, which is insufficient to ensure the validity of the sequence. Therefore, the program does not correctly validate the sequence of pairs for every potential case.
