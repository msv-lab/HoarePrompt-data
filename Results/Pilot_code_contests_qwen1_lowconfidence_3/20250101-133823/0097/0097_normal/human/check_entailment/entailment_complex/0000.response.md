Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly validate all possible cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the code does not handle the case where the number of plays decreases between two consecutive moments. According to the problem description, the number of plays should never decrease because each player attempt increases the number of plays. However, the current implementation does not check for this condition.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
10 10
5 10
10 5
```

Here, the number of plays decreases from 10 to 5 between the first and second moments, and then again from 5 to 10 between the second and third moments. This violates the condition that the number of plays should never decrease. The code does not catch this issue, leading to incorrect validation.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that the number of plays never decreases between two consecutive moments. This can be added to the validation logic inside the loop.
