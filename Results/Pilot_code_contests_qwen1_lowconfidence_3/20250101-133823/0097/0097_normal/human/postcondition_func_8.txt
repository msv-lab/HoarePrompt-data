The function `sortDictWithKey` accepts a dictionary `passedDic` as a parameter. This dictionary contains key-value pairs where the keys are integers representing moments of time, starting from 0, and the values are tuples of two integers (p_i, c_i), representing the number of plays and the number of clears at those moments. The function sorts this dictionary based on its keys in ascending order and then returns the sorted dictionary. This ensures that the returned dictionary maintains the order of time moments from earliest to latest while preserving the associated (p_i, c_i) values. Potential edge cases include the scenario where the input dictionary is empty or already sorted, in which case the function still returns the same dictionary. There is no missing functionality as the provided code accurately implements the described behavior.
