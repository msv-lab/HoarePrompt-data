The function `sortDictWithVal` accepts a dictionary `passedDic` as a parameter and returns a new dictionary containing all key-value pairs from `passedDic`, sorted by the values of the key-value pairs. If two key-value pairs have the same value, they are sorted by their keys. The original dictionary `passedDic` remains unchanged. After the function execution, the returned dictionary has its items sorted according to the specified criteria. Potential edge cases include handling an empty input dictionary, where the returned dictionary will also be empty. There is no missing functionality in the provided code; it correctly sorts the dictionary as described.
