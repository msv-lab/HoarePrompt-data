The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to handle inputs `N` and `M` where `N` and `M` are integers such that 2 ≤ N, M ≤ 50, and a_i, b_i are integers satisfying 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ N and a_i ≠ b_i for all 1 ≤ i ≤ M. However, since the function signature provided does not include any parameters, we can only describe the constraints and expected inputs without specifying the exact parameter names.

Functionality: **The function handles inputs N and M where 2 ≤ N, M ≤ 50, and a_i, b_i are integers satisfying 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ N and a_i ≠ b_i for all 1 ≤ i ≤ M.**
