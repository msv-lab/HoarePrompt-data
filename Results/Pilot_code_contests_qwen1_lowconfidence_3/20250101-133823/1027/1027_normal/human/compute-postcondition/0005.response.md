`count[b - 1]` is incremented by 1. The value of `b` is an integer input, so `count[b - 1]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, `count[a - 1]` is incremented by 1, `count[b - 1]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, `count[a - 1]` is incremented by 1, `count[b - 1]` is incremented by 1**
