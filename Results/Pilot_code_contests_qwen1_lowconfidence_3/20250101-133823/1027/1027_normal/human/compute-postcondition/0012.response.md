`count[a - 1]` is incremented by 1. The value of `a` is an integer input, so `count[a - 1]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `count[a - 1]` is incremented by 1 (now it is `count[a - 1] + 1`), `count[b - 1]` is incremented by 1, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `count[a - 1]` is incremented by 1 (now it is `count[a - 1] + 1`), `count[b - 1]` is incremented by 1, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input**
