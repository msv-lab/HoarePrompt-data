Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `count` is a list of length `n` where each element `count[i]` (0-indexed) represents the number of times `i + 1` appears in the inputs, `N` is `n`, `M` is `m`, and `i` is `n - 1`; all elements `count[0]` through `count[n-1]` are printed.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n-1`. This means it will print each element in the `count` list exactly once.
- Since the loop runs for `n` iterations, `i` will take the value of `n-1` after the last iteration.
- After the loop completes, all elements in the `count` list will have been printed. Therefore, `count` remains unchanged, and `m`, `N`, and `M` also remain unchanged.

Thus, the final state of the variables is that `m` is a non-negative integer, `count` is a list of length `n` representing the counts of each input value, `N` is `n`, `M` is `m`, and `i` is `n-1`.
