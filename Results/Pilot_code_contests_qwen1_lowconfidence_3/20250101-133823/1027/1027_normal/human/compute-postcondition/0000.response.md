The code `n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them by whitespace, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The initial conditions are that `N` and `M` are integers such that `2 ≤ N, M ≤ 50`.

After executing the code, the values of `N` and `M` are replaced by the integers read from the input. The new values of `n` and `m` are the integers split and converted from the input.

Since the exact input values are not specified, we represent the output state in terms of the input values.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input and `m` is the second integer input, both are integers within the range [2, 50], and `N` is `n`, `M` is `m`**.
