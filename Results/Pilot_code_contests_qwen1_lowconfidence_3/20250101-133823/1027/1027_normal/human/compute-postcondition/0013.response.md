The code `count[b - 1] += 1` increments the value of `count[b - 1]` by 1. From the initial state, we know that `m` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and both `count[a - 1]` and `count[b - 1]` have been incremented by 1 before this line of code. After executing this line, the value of `count[b - 1]` will be incremented by 1 again.

So, the updated state is:
- `m` is greater than 2 (unchanged)
- `i` is 2 (unchanged)
- `count[a - 1]` is incremented by 1 (unchanged from the previous increment, so it is now `count[a - 1] + 1`)
- `count[b - 1]` is incremented by 1 (previous increment plus 1 more, so it is now `count[b - 1] + 1`)

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`m` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `count[a - 1]` is `count[a - 1] + 1`, `count[b - 1]` is `count[b - 1] + 1`**
