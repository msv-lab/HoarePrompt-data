Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the solution for the given problem description. It counts the number of roads connected to each city and prints the count for each city. The code processes the input as described, using a list `count` to keep track of the number of connections for each city. It handles all the cities and roads within the specified constraints (2 ≤ N, M ≤ 50) and correctly increments the count for each city connected by a road. The code does not miss any potential cases and works as expected for all given examples and potential inputs within the constraints. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
