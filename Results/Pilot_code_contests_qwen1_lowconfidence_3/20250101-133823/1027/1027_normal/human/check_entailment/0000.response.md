Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the number of roads connected to each city. It reads the number of cities `n` and roads `m`, then iterates over each road to increment the count of cities connected by that road. Finally, it prints the count for each city. Given the constraints and the problem description, this program handles all potential cases correctly without any logical errors or missing edge cases.
