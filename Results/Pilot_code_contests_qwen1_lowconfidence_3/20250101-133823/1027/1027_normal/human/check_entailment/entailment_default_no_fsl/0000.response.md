Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It initializes a list `count` of length `N` to keep track of the number of roads connected to each city. For each road specified in the input, it increments the count for both cities connected by the road. Finally, it prints the count for each city.

The code handles all potential cases within the given constraints:
- It correctly reads the number of cities `N` and roads `M`.
- It processes each road and increments the count for both cities involved.
- It prints the final counts for all cities.

Since the code correctly follows the problem description and handles all specified cases without issues, the correctness is **True**.
