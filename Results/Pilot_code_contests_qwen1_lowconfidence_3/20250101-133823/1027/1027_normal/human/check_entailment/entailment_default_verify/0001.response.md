Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func()` correctly calculates the number of roads connected to each city by initializing a list `count` to keep track of the connections. It iterates through each road specified in the input, incrementing the count for both cities involved. After processing all roads, it prints the count for each city as required. The output hints confirm that the function handles the expected input format and boundary conditions properly. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness.
