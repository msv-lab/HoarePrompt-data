Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the number of cities \(N\) and roads \(M\), processes each road by incrementing the count for both cities involved, and finally prints the count of roads connected to each city. The output hints confirm that the program correctly handles all specified cases, including boundary conditions and valid inputs within the given ranges. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as **True**.
