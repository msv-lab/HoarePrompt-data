Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the first line which contains two integers \( N \) and \( M \). These represent the number of cities and the number of roads, respectively.
   - It then proceeds to read \( M \) lines, each containing two integers \( a_i \) and \( b_i \), representing the cities connected by each road.

2. **Initialization**:
   - An array `count` of length \( N \) is initialized with zeros. This array will store the number of roads connected to each city.

3. **Counting Roads**:
   - For each road (defined by \( a_i \) and \( b_i \)), the program increments the count for both cities involved (`a_i - 1` and `b_i - 1`). Since indices in the `count` array are 0-based, this ensures that the correct city indices are updated.
   - This step ensures that each road is counted twice (once for each endpoint), as required.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all roads, the program prints the number of roads connected to each city by iterating over the `count` array and printing each value.

Given these steps, the program accurately counts the number of roads connected to each city as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential valid input case, as it consistently adheres to the requirements outlined.
