Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads two integers \(N\) and \(M\) from standard input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. These integers represent the number of cities and the number of roads, respectively.
   - The constraints ensure that \(2 \leq N, M \leq 50\).

2. **Counting Roads**:
   - A list `count` of length \(N\) is initialized with zeros. This list keeps track of the number of roads connected to each city.
   - For each of the \(M\) roads, the program reads the endpoints \(a\) and \(b\) from standard input.
   - Since the roads are bidirectional, the program increments the count for both `a-1` and `b-1` in the `count` list. This ensures that the count reflects the total number of roads connected to each city.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all \(M\) roads, the program prints the count of roads connected to each city. Each count is printed on a new line, corresponding to the cities numbered from 1 to \(N\).

### Verification:
- The program correctly initializes the `count` list to store the counts.
- It correctly handles the bidirectional nature of the roads by incrementing the count for both endpoints.
- It processes all \(M\) roads and updates the counts accordingly.
- Finally, it prints the counts in the required format.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program always follows the specifications and correctly outputs the number of roads connected to each city. Therefore, the program is correct.
