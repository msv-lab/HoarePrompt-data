The function takes two integers \(N\) and \(M\) as input, where \(2 \leq N, M \leq 50\), and processes \(M\) pairs of integers \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq N\) and \(a \neq b\). It counts the number of times each integer from 1 to \(N\) appears in these pairs. Specifically, it increments the count for both \(a-1\) and \(b-1\) in a list `count` of length \(N\). After processing all pairs, it prints the count of appearances for each integer from 1 to \(N\). The function does not return any value; instead, it modifies and prints the `count` list. Potential edge cases include when \(N\) or \(M\) is exactly 2, and when the input values for \(a\) and \(b\) are at the boundary conditions (i.e., 1 or \(N\)). The function also assumes valid input within the specified range.
