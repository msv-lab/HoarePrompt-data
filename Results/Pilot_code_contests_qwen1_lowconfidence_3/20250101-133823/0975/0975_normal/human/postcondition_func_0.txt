The function reads in the number of nodes \(n\) and edges \(m\) from standard input, followed by \(m\) pairs representing friendships between nodes. It constructs a graph where each node is connected to its friends. Then, it checks whether the graph contains a clique (a subset of nodes where every two distinct nodes are adjacent) of size \(n\). If such a clique exists, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function operates on the inferred inputs \(n\), \(m\), and friendship pairs \((ai, bi)\), and returns a string indicating whether a full clique exists.
