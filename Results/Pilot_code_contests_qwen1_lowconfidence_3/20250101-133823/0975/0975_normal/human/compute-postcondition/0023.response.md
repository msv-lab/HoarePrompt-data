The code initializes the variable `isGood` to `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of other variables such as `n`, `m`, `graph`, `i`, `edge`, or `leftToCheck`. The value of `isGood` being set to `True` indicates that initially, there are no conditions that make `isGood` false.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\); `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\); `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n`. Each key's value is a list containing all vertices connected to it by edges; `i` is `m`; `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, representing two vertices connected by an edge; `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`; `isGood` is `True`.**
