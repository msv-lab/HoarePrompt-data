Postcondition: ***`checkMe` is the last element of `leftToCheck` after it is popped, `leftToCheck` is the list `leftToCheck` with its last element removed, `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]` and must contain at least one element, `cliqueSize` is the length of `neighbors`. If the length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`, `isGood` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block. Otherwise, there is no specific action mentioned for the else part, so the state remains as it is.***
