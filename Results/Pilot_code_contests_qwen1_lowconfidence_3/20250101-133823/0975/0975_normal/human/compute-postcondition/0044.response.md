Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\), `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n`, and each key's value is a list containing all vertices connected to it by edges, `i` is `m`, `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, representing two vertices connected by an edge, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is `False`, `checkMe` is `None`, `neighbors` is an empty list, `cliqueSize` is the length of `neighbors` before entering the loop. The loop iterates over all `neighbors` of `checkMe` and checks if the length of `graph[neighbor]` is equal to `cliqueSize`. If any neighbor does not satisfy this condition, `isGood` is set to `False` and the loop is terminated early. After all iterations, if `isGood` is still `False`, it means at least one neighbor did not meet the condition, and `neighbors` is now an empty list.**

This state reflects the final conditions after the loop has executed for all possible iterations, considering the nature of the loop and its effect on the variables involved.
