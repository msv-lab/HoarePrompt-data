The code initializes `leftToCheck` as a set containing integers from `(i + 1)` for `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`. Given the initial state, the set `leftToCheck` will contain the integers from `1` to `n`.

- `n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\).
- `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\).
- `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n`. Each key's value is a list containing all vertices connected to it by edges.
- `i` is initially `m`.
- `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, representing two vertices connected by an edge.

The code snippet initializes `leftToCheck` as a set containing the integers from `1` to `n`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `graph`, `i`, or `edge`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\); `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\); `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n`. Each key's value is a list containing all vertices connected to it by edges; `i` is `m`; `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, representing two vertices connected by an edge; `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`.**
