The code `neighbors = graph[checkMe]` assigns the list of neighbors of `checkMe` from the `graph` dictionary to the variable `neighbors`. This does not change the value of `checkMe`, `leftToCheck`, `isGood`, or `edge`, and only updates the value of `neighbors`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\), `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n`. Each key's value is a list containing all vertices connected to it by edges, `i` is `m`, `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, representing two vertices connected by an edge, `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except for `checkMe`, `isGood` is `True`, `checkMe` is the popped value from `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of integers from `graph[checkMe]`**.
