Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `len(leftToCheck) > 0`. This means the loop will continue as long as there are elements in the `leftToCheck` set.

2. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\).
   - `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\).
   - `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n`, and each key's value is a list containing all vertices connected to it by edges.
   - `i` is `m`.
   - `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, representing two vertices connected by an edge.
   - `leftToCheck` is an empty set.
   - `isGood` is `False`.
   - `checkMe` is `None`.
   - `neighbors` is the same list it was before the loop started, and its length (`cliqueSize`) is the length of `neighbors` before entering the loop.

3. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, the only requirement is that `leftToCheck` must contain at least one element at the end of the current iteration. Since `leftToCheck` starts as an empty set, we need to add at least one element to it during the loop execution.

4. **Conclusion**: To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `leftToCheck` contains at least one element at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `leftToCheck` is non-empty.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\), `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n`, and each key's value is a list containing all vertices connected to it by edges, `i` is `m`, `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, representing two vertices connected by an edge, `leftToCheck` is a non-empty set, `isGood` is `False`, `checkMe` is `None`, `neighbors` is the same list it was before the loop started, and its length (`cliqueSize`) is the length of `neighbors` before entering the loop.**
