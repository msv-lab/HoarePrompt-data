The code `break` is used to exit the current loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, it simply exits the most recent loop or conditional statement that was active. Given the initial state, none of the variables are directly affected by the `break` statement, and it does not change the state of the program outside of exiting the loop or conditional statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\); `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\); `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n`, and each key's value is a list containing all vertices connected to it by edges; `i` is equal to `m`; `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, representing two vertices connected by an edge; `leftToCheck` is an empty set; `isGood` is `False`; `checkMe` is the last element of the original `leftToCheck`; `neighbors` is the list of integers corresponding to the keys in `graph` that are connected to `checkMe`; `cliqueSize` is the length of `neighbors`; `neighbor` is an element of `neighbors`; the length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
