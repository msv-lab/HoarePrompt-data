Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\); `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\); `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n`. Each key's value is a list containing all vertices connected to it by edges; `i` is `m`; `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, where `edge[0]` and `edge[1]` represent the two vertices connected by the edge.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `m` times, adding edges to the graph.
- After each iteration, `graph[edge[0]]` and `graph[edge[1]]` are updated to include each other, representing an undirected edge between the two vertices.
- Since the loop runs exactly `m` times, `i` will be equal to `m` when the loop finishes.
- The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are defined in the initial state and do not change during the loop execution.
- The `graph` dictionary will have all the edges added, connecting each vertex to its neighbors as specified by the input edges.
