The code sets `leftToCheck` to an empty set, which means all elements previously in `leftToCheck` are removed. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\); `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\); `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n`, and each key's value is a list containing all vertices connected to it by edges; `i` is equal to `m`; `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, representing two vertices connected by an edge; `leftToCheck` is an empty set; `isGood` is `False`; `checkMe` is undefined; `neighbors` is undefined; `cliqueSize` is undefined; `neighbor` is undefined.**
