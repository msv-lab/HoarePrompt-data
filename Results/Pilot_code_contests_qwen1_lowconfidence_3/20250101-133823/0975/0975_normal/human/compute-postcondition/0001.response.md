The code `graph = {}` creates an empty dictionary and assigns it to the variable `graph`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `m`, which were read from input and are within their specified ranges. The precondition for the values of `n` and `m` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\); `m` is an integer read from input such that \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\); `graph` is an empty dictionary**
