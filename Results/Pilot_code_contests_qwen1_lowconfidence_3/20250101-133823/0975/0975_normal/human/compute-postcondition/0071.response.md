`cliqueSize` is assigned the value of `len(neighbors)`. The length of `neighbors` gives the number of elements in it. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `checkMe` is the last element of `leftToCheck` after it is popped; `leftToCheck` is the list `leftToCheck` with its last element removed; `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]`; `cliqueSize` is the length of `neighbors`.

Output State: **`checkMe` is the last element of `leftToCheck` after it is popped; `leftToCheck` is the list `leftToCheck` with its last element removed; `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]`; `cliqueSize` is the length of `neighbors`**
