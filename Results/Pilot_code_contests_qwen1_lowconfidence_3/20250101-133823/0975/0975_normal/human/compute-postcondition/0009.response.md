State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\), `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n` and the values are all empty lists, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(m):` will iterate from `0` to `m-1`.
2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `n`: Given as an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\).
   - `m`: Given as an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\).
   - `graph`: A dictionary where keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n`, and each value is an empty list.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to start executing, the variable `i` should be initialized to `0`. This is because the `range(m)` function generates numbers from `0` to `m-1`.
   - The other variables (`n` and `m`) are already given in their valid ranges, so no adjustment is needed for them.

Thus, the required state to ensure the loop can execute is:
- `n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\),
- `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\),
- `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n` and the values are all empty lists,
- `i` is 0.
