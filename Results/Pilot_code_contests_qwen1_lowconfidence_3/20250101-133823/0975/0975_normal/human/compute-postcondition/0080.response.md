The code sets `leftToCheck` to an empty set. This affects the `leftToCheck` variable, removing its previous content. The other variables (`checkMe`, `neighbors`, `cliqueSize`, and `isGood`) are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`checkMe` is the last element of `leftToCheck` after it is popped, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]` and must contain at least two elements, `cliqueSize` is the length of `neighbors`, `isGood` is `False`.**
