The code appends `edge[0]` to the list associated with `edge[1]` in the `graph` dictionary. Since the `edge` tuple is read from standard input, its values are unknown, but the structure of the `graph` dictionary and the value of `i` are updated as follows:

- The value of `graph[edge[1]]` will include `edge[0]`.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still 1.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `graph`, and `edge`) remain unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\); `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\); `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n` and the values are all empty lists except for the key `edge[1]` which now has a value that includes `edge[0]` and `edge[1]`; `i` is 1; `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input; `graph[edge[1]]` includes `edge[0]`.**
