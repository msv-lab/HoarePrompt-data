Postcondition: ***`checkMe` is the last element of `leftToCheck` after it is popped, `leftToCheck` is a list with its last element removed, `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]` and must contain at least two elements, `cliqueSize` is the length of `neighbors`. If `len(graph[neighbor]) != cliqueSize`, then `isGood` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no specific action mentioned in the else part, so the postcondition remains as is without additional changes.***
