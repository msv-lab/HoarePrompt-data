Output State: **`leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is `False`, `checkMe` is `None`, `neighbors` is an empty list, `cliqueSize` is 0**.

Explanation:
- After the loop completes, `leftToCheck` becomes an empty set because all elements have been checked.
- `isGood` remains `False` if the loop detected any inconsistency during its execution.
- `checkMe` becomes `None` because there are no more elements in `leftToCheck` to check.
- `neighbors` becomes an empty list because all possible elements to check have been removed from `leftToCheck`.
- `cliqueSize` becomes 0 because the loop discards the neighbors of `checkMe`, and the final value of `cliqueSize` would be the size of the last `neighbors` list checked, which eventually becomes an empty list.

This output state captures the final values of the variables after the loop has completed its iterations.
