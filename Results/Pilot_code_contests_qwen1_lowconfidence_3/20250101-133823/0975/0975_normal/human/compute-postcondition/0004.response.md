Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `m` remains as initially described (its value is not specified in the problem, so we will keep it as is).
   - `graph[i + 1]` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each value of `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Current Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `graph[i + 1]` (which is `graph[1]`) is an empty list.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
   - `i` will be 1.

5. **Checking Loop Condition**: The loop will continue if `i < n`. Since `i` is now 1, the loop will continue as long as `1 < n`.

6. **State Adjustment**: The only state that changes is `i`. The rest of the states (`n`, `m`, and `graph[i + 1]`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `i` is 1, `m` remains as initially described, and `graph[i + 1]` is an empty list**.
