The code `edge = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())` reads a line from standard input, splits it into components, and converts each component to an integer, then assigns these integers to the variable `edge`. This means `edge` will be a tuple of integers.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\)
- `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\)
- `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n` and the values are all empty lists except for the key `edge[1]` which now has a value that includes `edge[0]`
- `i` is 1

After executing the code, `edge` is updated to a tuple of integers read from the standard input, and the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\), `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n` and the values are all empty lists except for the key `edge[1]` which now has a value that includes `edge[0]`, `i` is 1, `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input**
