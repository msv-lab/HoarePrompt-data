Postcondition: **`isGood` remains `False`, `i` remains `m`, `edge` remains a tuple of integers, `leftToCheck` remains an empty set, `checkMe` remains `None`, `neighbors` contains two elements, and `neighbor` is the second element of `neighbors`. If the length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`, the condition is checked and remains as it is.**
