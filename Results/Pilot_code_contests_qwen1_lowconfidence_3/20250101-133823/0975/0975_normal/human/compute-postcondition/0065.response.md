Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\); `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\); `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n`, and each key's value is a list containing all vertices connected to it by edges; `i` is equal to `m`; `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, representing two vertices connected by an edge; `leftToCheck` is either an empty set or has one less element than before; `isGood` is `False`; `checkMe` is the new last element of the updated `leftToCheck`; `neighbors` is the list of integers corresponding to the keys in `graph` that are connected to the new `checkMe` excluding the first element; `cliqueSize` is the length of the new `neighbors`; `neighbor` is the second element of the new `neighbors`; if `len(graph[neighbor]) != cliqueSize`, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement; otherwise, the conditions remain as they were before the if-else block. If the if condition evaluates to true, `leftToCheck` becomes an empty set.***
