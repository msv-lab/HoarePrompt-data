To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the `for` loop will start iterating. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`, meaning `i` will take values from 0 up to `n-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer read from input such that \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\)
- `m` is an integer read from input such that \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\)
- `graph` is an empty dictionary

For the loop to execute, the variable `i` must start from 0 and go up to `n-1`. The value of `n` directly dictates the number of iterations the loop will perform. Therefore, the key aspect here is ensuring that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, as specified.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:

1. Ensure `n` is within the given range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\).
2. Initialize `i` to 0, as it is the starting point of the loop.

So, the required state adjustments are:

State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `i` is 0, and `m` and `graph` remain as initially described.**
