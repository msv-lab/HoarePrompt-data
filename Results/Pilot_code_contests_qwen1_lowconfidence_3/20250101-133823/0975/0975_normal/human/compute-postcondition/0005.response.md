The code `graph[i + 1] = []` assigns an empty list to the index `i + 1` in the variable `graph`. Initially, `i` is 1, so `graph[i + 1]` is equivalent to `graph[2]`. After executing this line, `graph[2]` is set to an empty list. The values of `n`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `i` is 1, `m` remains as initially described, and `graph[2]` is an empty list**
