The code `graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])` impacts the `graph` dictionary by adding an edge from `edge[0]` to `edge[1]` in reverse compared to the previous snippet. The `i` and `m` variables are not affected. The previous state is that `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n` and the values are all empty lists, `n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\), and `i` is 0.

The new edge is added such that the value corresponding to the key `edge[1]` in the `graph` dictionary now includes `edge[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\); `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\); `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n` and the values are all empty lists except for the key `edge[1]` which now has a value that includes `edge[0]`; `i` is 0.**
