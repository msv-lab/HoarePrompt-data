`checkMe` is assigned the value of `leftToCheck.pop()`, which removes and returns the last element of the set `leftToCheck`. Since `leftToCheck` is a non-empty set, `checkMe` now holds the value of the last element that was in `leftToCheck`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\), `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n`, and each key's value is a list containing all vertices connected to it by edges, `i` is `m`, `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, representing two vertices connected by an edge, `leftToCheck` is a non-empty set with one less element than before, `isGood` is `False`, `checkMe` is the last element of the original `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the same list it was before the loop started, and its length (`cliqueSize`) is the length of `neighbors` before entering the loop.**
