The function `func` accepts no parameters directly. However, based on the constraints provided, it seems that the function might be expected to process some internal data or inputs that are not explicitly passed as arguments but inferred from the context. The constraints mention that there are integers `n` and `m` with specific ranges, and pairs `(ai, bi)` representing friendships.

Given the structure of the problem, the function likely receives these inputs indirectly through some form of external data or predefined state. Nonetheless, adhering strictly to the provided format:

The function `func` accepts no parameters directly. However, it operates on an inferred `n` (an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), an inferred `m` (an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2), and inferred pairs `(ai, bi)` (representing distinct members that are friends, with 1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n and ai ≠ bi). The functionality of the function `func` is to process these inferred inputs to determine some outcome based on the friendship pairs.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates on inferred inputs `n`, `m`, and friendship pairs `(ai, bi)`, returning a result based on these inputs.**
