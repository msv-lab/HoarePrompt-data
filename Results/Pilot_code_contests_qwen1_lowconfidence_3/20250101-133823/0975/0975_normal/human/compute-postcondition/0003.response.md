`graph[i + 1]` is assigned an empty list, which means the key `i + 1` in the dictionary `graph` now points to an empty list. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `i` is 0, `m` remains as initially described, and `graph[i + 1]` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `i` is 0, `m` remains as initially described, and `graph[i + 1]` is an empty list**
