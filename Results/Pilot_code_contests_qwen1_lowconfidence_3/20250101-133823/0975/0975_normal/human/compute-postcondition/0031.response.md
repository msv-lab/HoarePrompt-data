The code sets `leftToCheck` to an empty set, which means all elements that were previously in `leftToCheck` have been removed. No other variables are directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `leftToCheck`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\), `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n`, and each key's value is a list containing all vertices connected to it by edges, `i` is `m`, `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, representing two vertices connected by an edge, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is `False`, `checkMe` is the popped value from `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` contains at least one element, `cliqueSize` is the length of `neighbors`, the length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`**.
