`checkMe` is assigned the value of `leftToCheck.pop()`, which removes and returns an arbitrary element from `leftToCheck`. Since `leftToCheck` contains integers from 1 to `n`, the value of `checkMe` is one of these integers. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\), `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n`. Each key's value is a list containing all vertices connected to it by edges, `i` is `m`, `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, representing two vertices connected by an edge, `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except for `checkMe`, `isGood` is `True`, `checkMe` is the popped value from `leftToCheck`.**
