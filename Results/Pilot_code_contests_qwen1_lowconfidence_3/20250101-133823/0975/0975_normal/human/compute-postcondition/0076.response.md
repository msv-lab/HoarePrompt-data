The code `break` is executed, which does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`checkMe` is the last element of the empty set, `leftToCheck` is the set `[]`, `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]` and must contain at least one element, `cliqueSize` is the length of `neighbors`, and `isGood` is `False`. We break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.**
