The code appends `edge[1]` to the list associated with `edge[0]` in the dictionary `graph`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\)
- `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\)
- `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n` and the values are all empty lists except for the key `edge[1]` which now has a value that includes `edge[0]`
- `i` is 1
- `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input

After the code runs, `graph[edge[0]]` will have `edge[1]` appended to it. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\); `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\); `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n` and the values are all empty lists except for the key `edge[1]` which now has a value that includes `edge[0]` and `edge[1]`; `i` is 1; `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input**
