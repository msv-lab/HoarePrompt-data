The code `cliqueSize = len(neighbors)` calculates the length of the list `neighbors` and assigns it to the variable `cliqueSize`. The value of `cliqueSize` is determined by the number of elements in the list `neighbors`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\)
- `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\)
- `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n`, and each key's value is a list containing all vertices connected to it by edges
- `i` is `m`
- `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, representing two vertices connected by an edge
- `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except for `checkMe`
- `isGood` is `True`
- `checkMe` is the popped value from `leftToCheck`
- `neighbors` is the list of integers from `graph[checkMe]`

The variable `cliqueSize` is updated with the length of `neighbors`, but none of the other variables are directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain the same as before.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\); `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\); `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n`, and each key's value is a list containing all vertices connected to it by edges; `i` is `m`; `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, representing two vertices connected by an edge; `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except for `checkMe`; `isGood` is `True`; `checkMe` is the popped value from `leftToCheck`; `neighbors` is the list of integers from `graph[checkMe]`; `cliqueSize` is the length of `neighbors`.**
