Functionality: **The function reads in the number of nodes \(n\) and edges \(m\) from standard input, followed by \(m\) pairs representing friendships between nodes. It constructs a graph where each node is connected to its friends. Then, it checks whether the graph contains a clique (a subset of nodes where every two distinct nodes are adjacent) of size \(n\). If such a clique exists, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function operates on the inferred inputs \(n\), \(m\), and friendship pairs \((ai, bi)\), and returns a string indicating whether a full clique exists.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that the input values are valid (i.e., \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\) and \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\)). If invalid values are provided, the function may produce unexpected results.
- The function does not handle the case where the input does not form a valid graph structure (e.g., duplicate edges or disconnected components). This could lead to incorrect conclusions about the presence of a full clique.
- The function does not explicitly check for the existence of a clique of size \(n\) but rather checks if every node's neighbors have the same number of connections. This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee the presence of a full clique. A full clique of size \(n\) requires every node to be connected to every other node, which is a much stricter condition than the current logic checks.
