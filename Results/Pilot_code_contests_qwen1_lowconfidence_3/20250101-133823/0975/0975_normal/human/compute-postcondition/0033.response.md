Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\), `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n`, and each key's value is a list containing all vertices connected to it by edges, `i` is `m`, `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, representing two vertices connected by an edge, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is `False`, `checkMe` is the popped value from `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` contains at least one element. If the length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`, `isGood` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `isGood` remains `True`.***
