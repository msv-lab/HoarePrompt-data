The code sets `isGood` to `False`. This assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the only change is to the value of `isGood`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\), `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n`, and each key's value is a list containing all vertices connected to it by edges, `i` is equal to `m`, `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, representing two vertices connected by an edge, `leftToCheck` is a non-empty set with one less element than before, `isGood` is `False`, `checkMe` is the last element of the original `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of integers corresponding to the keys in `graph` that are connected to `checkMe`, `cliqueSize` is the length of `neighbors`, `neighbor` is an element of `neighbors`, the length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`**.
