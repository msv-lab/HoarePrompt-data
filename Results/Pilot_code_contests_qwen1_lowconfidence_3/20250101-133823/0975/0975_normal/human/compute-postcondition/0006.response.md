According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `n` does not change since it is the upper bound of the range and is not modified within the loop body.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2, and `n` will still be within the same range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\).

State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `i` is 2, `m` remains as initially described, and `graph[2]` is an empty list**
