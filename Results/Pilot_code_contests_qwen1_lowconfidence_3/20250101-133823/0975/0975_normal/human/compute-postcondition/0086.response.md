The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `isGood` and `leftToCheck`. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no such loop or switch statement in the given initial state, the `break` statement here does not change any variable values but indicates that we would exit a loop or switch.

Output State: **`isGood` is False; `leftToCheck` is a set([]) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
