The code snippet `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is `True`, `checkMe` is `None`, `neighbors` is an empty list, `cliqueSize` is 0**
