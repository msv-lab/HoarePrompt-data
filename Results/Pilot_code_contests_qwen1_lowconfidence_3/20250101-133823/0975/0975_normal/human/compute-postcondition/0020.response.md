The code appends `edge[0]` to the list `graph[edge[1]]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, and `edge` are not directly affected by this line of code, so they remain unchanged. The only variable that is impacted is `graph[edge[1]]`, which now includes `edge[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\); `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\); `graph` is a dictionary where most keys map to empty lists, and `graph[edge[1]]` includes `edge[0]`; `i` is 2; `edge` is a tuple of integers**
