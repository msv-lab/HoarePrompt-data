The `break` statement does not modify the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Given the initial state, no changes are made to the variables except potentially breaking out of a loop or conditional statement. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned, the only effect is that the loop or conditional is exited.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\); `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\); `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n`, and each key's value is a list containing all vertices connected to it by edges; `i` is equal to `m`; `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, representing two vertices connected by an edge; `leftToCheck` is an empty set; `isGood` is `False`; `checkMe` is the new last element of the updated `leftToCheck`; `neighbors` is the list of integers corresponding to the keys in `graph` that are connected to the new `checkMe`; `cliqueSize` is the length of the new `neighbors`; `neighbor` is the first element of the new `neighbors`; we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.**
