To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state such that the condition `len(leftToCheck) > 0` is true.

Given the loop condition:
```python
while len(leftToCheck) > 0:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The current state before the loop is:
- `n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\)
- `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\)
- `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n`. Each key's value is a list containing all vertices connected to it by edges
- `i` is `m`
- `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, representing two vertices connected by an edge
- `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`
- `isGood` is `True`

For the loop to execute at least once, `len(leftToCheck)` must be greater than 0. Since `leftToCheck` is initially a set containing integers from 1 to `n`, it will always be non-empty unless explicitly modified. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the state for `leftToCheck`.

Thus, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\), `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n`. Each key's value is a list containing all vertices connected to it by edges, `i` is `m`, `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, representing two vertices connected by an edge, `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`, `isGood` is `True`**
