The code `graph[i + 1] = []` assigns an empty list to the index `i + 1` in the `graph` list. Given the initial state where `i` is 2, the new value at `graph[3]` (since `i + 1` equals 3) is an empty list. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, and `graph[2]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `i` is 2, `m` remains as initially described, `graph[2]` is an empty list, and `graph[3]` is an empty list**
