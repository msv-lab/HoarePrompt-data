The code reads edges from standard input and splits them into integers using `map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())`. This means that the input should be a line of space-separated integers representing edges, and these integers will be converted to a list of integers.

Since the exact input is not provided, we can denote the input as a list of integers `edges` which will be the result of the split operation. The variable `edge` will hold this list of integers. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\), `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n` and the values are all empty lists, `i` is 0, `edge` is a list of integers**
