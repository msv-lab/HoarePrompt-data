`neighbors` is assigned the value of `graph[checkMe]`. The variable `checkMe` is the last element of `leftToCheck` after it is popped, and `leftToCheck` is the list `leftToCheck` with its last element removed. The state of the `graph` dictionary is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of `neighbors`.

Output State: **`checkMe` is the last element of `leftToCheck` after it is popped; `leftToCheck` is the list `leftToCheck` with its last element removed; `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]`**
