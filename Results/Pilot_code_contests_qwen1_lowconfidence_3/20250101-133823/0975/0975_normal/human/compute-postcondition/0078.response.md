According to the code, the loop iterates over each `neighbor` in `neighbors`. The loop can execute again if there are more elements in `neighbors` after the current iteration.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `checkMe` is the last element of `leftToCheck` after it is popped.
- `leftToCheck` is the list `leftToCheck` with its last element removed.
- `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]` and must contain at least one element.
- `cliqueSize` is the length of `neighbors`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `neighbors` must contain at least one more element after the current iteration. Since `neighbors` contains at least one element at the start of the loop, if there is only one element left in `neighbors`, the loop will terminate after the current iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `neighbors` has at least two elements to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`checkMe` is the last element of `leftToCheck` after it is popped, `leftToCheck` is the list `leftToCheck` with its last element removed, `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]` and must contain at least two elements, `cliqueSize` is the length of `neighbors`.**
