The code `n, m = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())` reads two integers from standard input, splits them, and converts them to integers. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial conditions specify that `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\) and `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\). After executing the code, the values of `n` and `m` are updated based on the input, while the pairings of friends remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is an integer read from input such that \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\); `m` is an integer read from input such that \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\)`**
