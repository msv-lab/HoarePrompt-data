The code `graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])` appends the value of `edge[1]` to the list in `graph` whose key is `edge[0]`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\)
- `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\)
- `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n` and the values are all empty lists
- `i` is 0
- `edge` is a list of integers

The code impacts the `graph` dictionary by adding an edge from `edge[0]` to `edge[1]`. The `i` and `m` variables are not affected.

The Output State is:
**`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\); `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\); `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n` and the values are all empty lists except for the key `edge[0]` which now has a value that includes `edge[1]`; `i` is 0.**
