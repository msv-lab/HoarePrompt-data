Output State: **`checkMe` is the last element of `leftToCheck` after it is popped, `leftToCheck` is a list (potentially empty) with its last element removed, `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]` and must contain at least `cliqueSize` elements, `cliqueSize` is the length of `neighbors`. If during any iteration of the loop, `len(graph[neighbor])` is not equal to `cliqueSize`, then `isGood` is `False` and `leftToCheck` becomes an empty set. Otherwise, `isGood` remains `True` and the loop completes without breaking.**

### Explanation:
- **Variables involved:**
  - `checkMe`: The last element of `leftToCheck` after it is popped.
  - `leftToCheck`: The list `leftToCheck` with its last element removed.
  - `neighbors`: The value of `graph[checkMe]`.
  - `cliqueSize`: The length of `neighbors`.

- **Loop behavior:**
  - The loop iterates over each `neighbor` in `neighbors`.
  - For each `neighbor`, it checks if `len(graph[neighbor])` is not equal to `cliqueSize`.
  - If the condition is met, `isGood` is set to `False`, `leftToCheck` is set to an empty set (`set([])`), and the loop breaks.
  - If the condition is not met for any `neighbor`, the loop continues until all `neighbors` are processed.

- **Final state:**
  - After the loop completes (or breaks), `checkMe` will be the last element of `leftToCheck` after it is popped.
  - `leftToCheck` will be a list with its last element removed.
  - `neighbors` will be the value of `graph[checkMe]` when the loop ends, and it must have at least `cliqueSize` elements.
  - `cliqueSize` remains the length of `neighbors`.
  - If `isGood` is `False`, `leftToCheck` is an empty set. Otherwise, `isGood` is `True`.

Thus, the final state of the program after the loop is as described above.
