The code reads an edge from standard input and converts it into integers using `map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())`. This means the edge values will be split from the input string and converted to integers. However, the specific values of these integers are not known until the input is provided. The `edge` variable will be a tuple of these two integers.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\)
- `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\)
- `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n` and the values are all empty lists except for the key `edge[1]` which now has a value that includes `edge[0]` and `edge[1]`
- `i` is 2
- `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, `graph[edge[1]]` includes `edge[0]`

After the code is executed, the `edge` variable will be updated to the tuple of integers read from the input. The values of `n`, `m`, `graph`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\); `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\); `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from 1 to `n` and the values are all empty lists except for the key `edge[1]` which now has a value that includes `edge[0]` and `edge[1]`; `i` is 2; `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, `graph[edge[1]]` includes `edge[0]`**
