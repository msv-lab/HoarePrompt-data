Postcondition: ***`checkMe` is the last element of `leftToCheck` after it is popped, `leftToCheck` is the list `leftToCheck` with its last element removed, `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]` and must contain at least one element, `cliqueSize` is the length of `neighbors`. The length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`***
