The variable `isGood` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The other variables (`checkMe`, `leftToCheck`, `neighbors`, and `cliqueSize`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`checkMe` is the last element of `leftToCheck` after it is popped, `leftToCheck` is the list `leftToCheck` with its last element removed, `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]` and must contain at least two elements, `cliqueSize` is the length of `neighbors`, `isGood` is `False`.**
