Postcondition: ***`isGood` remains `False`, `i` remains `m`, `edge` remains the tuple of integers read from standard input, `leftToCheck` remains an empty set, `checkMe` remains the popped value from `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` still contains exactly one element (since the first element was used in the previous iteration), `neighbor` remains the first element of `neighbors`. If the length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
