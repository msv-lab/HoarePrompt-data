The code initializes the variable `isGood` to `False`. This does not affect the values of `checkMe`, `leftToCheck`, `neighbors`, or `cliqueSize`. The only change is the assignment to `isGood`.

Output State: **`checkMe` is the last element of `leftToCheck` after it is popped, `leftToCheck` is the list `leftToCheck` with its last element removed, `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]` and must contain at least one element, `cliqueSize` is the length of `neighbors`, and `isGood` is `False`.**
