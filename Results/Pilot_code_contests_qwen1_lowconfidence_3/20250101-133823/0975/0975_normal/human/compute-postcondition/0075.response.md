The code sets `leftToCheck` to an empty set. This means the list `leftToCheck` is now converted to a set with no elements. The other variables (`checkMe`, `neighbors`, `cliqueSize`, and `isGood`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`checkMe` is the last element of the empty set, `leftToCheck` is the set `[]`, `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]` and must contain at least one element, `cliqueSize` is the length of `neighbors`, and `isGood` is `False`.**
