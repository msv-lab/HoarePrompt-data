The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console and does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is `False`, `checkMe` is `None`, `neighbors` is an empty list, `cliqueSize` is 0**
