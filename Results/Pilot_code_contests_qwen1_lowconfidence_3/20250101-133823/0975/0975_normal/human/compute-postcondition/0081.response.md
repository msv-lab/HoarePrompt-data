The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or the most internal if statement. In this case, since there is no loop or if statement present in the given code snippet, the execution will simply exit the context where this statement is placed. However, based on the initial state provided, no variables are updated or affected by this statement.

Output State: **`checkMe` is the last element of `leftToCheck` after it is popped, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]` and must contain at least two elements, `cliqueSize` is the length of `neighbors`, `isGood` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
