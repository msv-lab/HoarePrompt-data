The code appends `edge[1]` to the list `graph[edge[0]]`. Initially, `graph` is a dictionary where most keys map to empty lists, except for the key `edge[1]` which contains `[edge[0], edge[1]]`. After running the code, the list associated with `edge[0]` in `graph` will include `edge[1]`.

Let's denote the initial values as follows:
- `n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\)
- `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\)
- `graph` is a dictionary where most keys map to empty lists, and `graph[edge[1]]` is `[edge[0], edge[1]]`
- `i` is 2
- `edge` is a tuple of integers

After the code execution, `graph[edge[0]]` will be updated to include `edge[1]`. Since `graph[edge[1]]` already contains `[edge[0], edge[1]]`, `graph[edge[0]]` will also contain `edge[1]` but we only append it if it's not already there.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\); `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\); `graph` is a dictionary where most keys map to empty lists, and `graph[edge[0]]` includes `edge[1]`; `i` is 2; `edge` is a tuple of integers**.
