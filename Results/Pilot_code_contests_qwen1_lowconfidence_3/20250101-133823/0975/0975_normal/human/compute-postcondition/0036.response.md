The code `leftToCheck = set([])` assigns an empty set to the variable `leftToCheck`. This operation does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the only change is to the `leftToCheck` variable.

Output State: **`isGood` is `False`, `i` is `m`, `edge` is a tuple of integers read from standard input, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `checkMe` is the popped value from `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` contains exactly one element (since the first element was used in the previous iteration), `neighbor` is the first element of `neighbors`**
