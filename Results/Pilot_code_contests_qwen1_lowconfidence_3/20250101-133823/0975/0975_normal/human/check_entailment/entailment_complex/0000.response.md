Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution required by the problem description. Specifically, the program attempts to verify if the graph contains a clique of size \( n \), which is not equivalent to checking the transitive property of the friendships as described in the problem.

### Key Issues:
1. **Clique Check vs. Transitive Property:**
   - The problem requires checking the transitive property: if members \( X \) and \( Y \) are friends, and \( Y \) and \( Z \) are friends, then \( X \) and \( Z \) should also be friends.
   - The program instead tries to check if there exists a clique of size \( n \) (where every member is connected to every other member), which is a much stronger condition and not necessary for the problem.

2. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The logic inside the `while` loop does not correctly check the transitive property. It attempts to verify if all neighbors of a chosen vertex have the same number of connections (which is not relevant to the problem).
   - The variable `cliqueSize` is used incorrectly, and the program does not properly iterate over the members to check the transitive property.

### Correct Solution Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
1. Construct the graph from the input.
2. Iterate over all possible triplets of members and check if the transitive property holds for each triplet.
3. If the transitive property fails for any triplet, return "NO".
4. If all triplets pass the check, return "YES".

Hereâ€™s a correct implementation of the solution:

```python
from sys import stdin, stdout

def func():
    n, m = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
    graph = {i: [] for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    for x in range(1, n + 1):
        for y in graph[x]:
            for z in graph[y]:
                if z != x and z not in graph[x]:
                    print('NO')
                    return
    print('YES')

func()
```

This solution correctly checks the transitive property for all triplets of members and ensures that the program meets the problem description.
