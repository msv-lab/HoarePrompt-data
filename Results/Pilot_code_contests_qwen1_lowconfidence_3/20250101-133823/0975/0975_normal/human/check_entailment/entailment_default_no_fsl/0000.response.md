Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the social network is reasonable according to the given problem description. Specifically, the code checks for a clique of size \(n\) (where every node is connected to every other node), which is not equivalent to the required transitive closure property. 

The problem requires checking if for every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z then also X-Z. However, the current implementation only verifies that all nodes in the graph have the same degree, which is not sufficient. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
4 3
1 3
3 4
1 4
```
This input satisfies the transitive closure requirement (if 1-3 and 3-4, then 1-4). But the code would incorrectly identify this as "NO" because the degrees of the nodes are not all equal.

A correct approach would involve checking for transitivity explicitly, ensuring that for every pair of friends (X, Y), X is also a friend of every friend of Y. This can be done using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to verify transitivity.
