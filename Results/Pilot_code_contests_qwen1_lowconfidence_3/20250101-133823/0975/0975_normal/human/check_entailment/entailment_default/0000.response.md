Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to check if the network is reasonable according to the problem description. The code attempts to check if the graph contains a clique of size \(n\), which is not the correct approach. Instead, the code should verify the transitive property of friendship for every triplet of members.

Here is a more accurate implementation:

```python
def is_network_reasonable(n, m, edges):
    # Create an adjacency list
    adj_list = {i: set() for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u, v in edges:
        adj_list[u].add(v)
        adj_list[v].add(u)

    # Check the transitive property for every triplet
    for x in range(1, n + 1):
        for y in range(x + 1, n + 1):
            if y in adj_list[x]:  # X-Y
                for z in range(y + 1, n + 1):
                    if z in adj_list[y] and z not in adj_list[x]:  # Y-Z but not X-Z
                        return "NO"
    return "YES"

# Read input
n, m = map(int, input().strip().split())
edges = [tuple(map(int, input().strip().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Determine if the network is reasonable
print(is_network_reasonable(n, m, edges))
```

This implementation correctly checks the transitive property for every triplet of members, ensuring that if \(X-Y\) and \(Y-Z\), then \(X-Z\) must also hold true. The provided code fails to do this, making it incorrect.
