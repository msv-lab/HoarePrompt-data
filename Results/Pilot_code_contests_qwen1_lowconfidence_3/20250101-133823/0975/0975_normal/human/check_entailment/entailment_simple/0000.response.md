Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to check if the network is reasonable according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic inside the while loop is flawed and does not properly check the transitive property of friendship as described.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

1. **Incorrect Logic in the While Loop:**
   - The current implementation uses a set `leftToCheck` to keep track of nodes that need to be checked. However, it checks each node's neighbors and then incorrectly updates `leftToCheck` and `isGood`.
   - The variable `cliqueSize` is used to store the number of neighbors, but the subsequent logic to check if all neighbors form a clique is not implemented correctly.

2. **Missing Transitive Property Check:**
   - The problem requires checking if for every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z then also X-Z.
   - The provided code does not implement this transitive property check. Instead, it checks if all neighbors of a node have the same number of connections, which is not sufficient to verify the transitive property.

3. **Proper Implementation Required:**
   - To correctly check the transitive property, you need to iterate over all possible triplets of nodes and ensure that if X and Y are friends and Y and Z are friends, then X and Z must also be friends.
   - This would involve a nested loop to check all pairs of nodes and their neighbors.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly implement the solution, you need to use a different approach. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    graph = {i: [] for i in range(1, n+1)}
    
    for _ in range(m):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)

    for u, v in graph.items():
        for w in v:
            if w in graph[u]:
                for x in v:
                    if x != w and x in graph[u] and x not in graph[w]:
                        print("NO")
                        return
    
    print("YES")

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **Graph Construction:** Construct the graph as a dictionary where each key is a member and the value is a list of their friends.
2. **Triplets Check:** Use combinations to generate all possible triplets (X, Y, Z) and check if the transitive property holds.
3. **Transitive Property Verification:** For each triplet, if X and Y are friends and Y and Z are friends, check if X and Z are also friends. If not, print "NO" and return immediately.

This approach ensures that the program correctly verifies the transitive property of the friendship network.
