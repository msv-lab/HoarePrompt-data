Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to verify if the network is reasonable. Specifically, the program checks if all neighbors of a node have the same number of connections (clique size), which is not a sufficient condition to determine if the network is reasonable.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
4 4
3 1
2 3
3 4
1 2
```

In this case, the graph forms a cycle (1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-1), which is not a valid network according to the problem description. However, the program would incorrectly return "YES" because all nodes have neighbors with the same number of connections.

A correct solution would involve checking all triplets of nodes to ensure that if \(X\) is friends with \(Y\) and \(Y\) is friends with \(Z\), then \(X\) must also be friends with \(Z\). The provided program fails to implement this logic.
