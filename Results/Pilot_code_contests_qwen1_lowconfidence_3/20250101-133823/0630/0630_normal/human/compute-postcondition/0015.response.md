The code snippet `curr_scores[name] += score` indicates that the score associated with a player named `name` in the `curr_scores` dictionary is being incremented by `score`. However, the variables `curr_scores`, `name`, and `score` are not defined in the provided initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact impact of the code without additional context.

Given the lack of specific definitions for `curr_scores`, `name`, and `score`, the output state remains undefined based on the given information. The initial state of `rounds` is unchanged because it is not affected by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`rounds` is `[('Alice', 10), ('Bob', 20), ('Charlie', 30)]`, the code incrementing `curr_scores[name]` by `score` cannot be determined due to missing definitions.**
