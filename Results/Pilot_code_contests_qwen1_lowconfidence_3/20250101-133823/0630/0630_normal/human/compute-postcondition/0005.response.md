The code `final_scores[name] += score` updates the value in `final_scores` for the key `name`. Given the initial state where `name` is `'Alice'` and `score` is `10`, this line of code adds `10` to the existing value in `final_scores` for the key `'Alice'`. Since `final_scores` is initialized with a default factory of `int`, the initial value for `'Alice'` is `0`. Therefore, after the addition, the value for `'Alice'` in `final_scores` becomes `10`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `rounds` is `[('Alice', 10), ('Bob', 20), ('Charlie', 30)]`, `final_scores` is a `defaultdict` with default factory `int` and value `{'Alice': 10}`, `name` is `'Alice'`, `score` is `10`**
