Postcondition: ***`rounds` is `[('Alice', 10), ('Bob', 20), ('Charlie', 30)]`, `curr_scores` is a dictionary where the scores have been incremented by `score` for the names in `rounds`, and `name` is in `winner_candidates`. If `curr_scores[name]` is greater than or equal to `m`, the print statement has executed. Otherwise, no change in the state of `curr_scores` and `name` in `winner_candidates` remains as is.***
