The code `rounds = [input().split() for _ in range(n)]` creates a list of lists, where each sublist contains the player's name and their score from the input. The variable `n` is the number of rounds played, which is specified in the initial state.

- `rounds` is initialized as a list of lists, where each inner list contains a player's name and their score. The number of such sublists is `n`.

Since the code only updates the `rounds` variable, and does not modify the value of `n` or any other variables, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, indicating the number of rounds played; `rounds` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a player's name and their score from the input.**
