The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it takes its input from a predefined structure consisting of an integer `n` indicating the number of rounds played, followed by `n` lines of text. Each line contains a player's name (a string of lowercase Latin letters with a length from 1 to 32) and a score (an integer between -1000 and 1000). The number of rounds played (`n`) is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. At the end of the game, at least one player has a positive number of points, and there is a unique player or a tie for the highest score where one of the tied players had the highest score first.

The function does not return any value explicitly, but based on the input provided, it determines the unique player or resolves the tie for the highest score under the given conditions.
