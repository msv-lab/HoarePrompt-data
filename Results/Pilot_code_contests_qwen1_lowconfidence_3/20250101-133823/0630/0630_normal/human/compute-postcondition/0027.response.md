The code `print(name)` simply prints the value of the variable `name`. However, the value of `name` is not defined in the given code snippet, so it cannot be determined what exactly will be printed. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged variables and the print statement indicating the value of `name`.

Output State: **`rounds` remains as `[('Alice', 10), ('Bob', 20), ('Charlie', 30)]`; `curr_scores` is updated to include `curr_scores[name]` being increased by `score`; the value of `name` is printed**
