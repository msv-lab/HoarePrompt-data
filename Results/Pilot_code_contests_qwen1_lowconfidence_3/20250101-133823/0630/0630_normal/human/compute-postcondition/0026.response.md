The code `curr_scores[name] += score` updates the score of the player named `name` in the `curr_scores` dictionary by adding `score` to their current score. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `name` or `score`, we'll consider this in a general form. However, the structure of `curr_scores` and the list `rounds` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rounds` remains as `[('Alice', 10), ('Bob', 20), ('Charlie', 30)]`; `curr_scores` is updated to include `curr_scores[name]` being increased by `score`.**
