Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` indicating the number of rounds played, followed by `n` lines of text. Each line contains a player's name (a string of lowercase Latin letters with a length from 1 to 32) and a score (an integer between -1000 and 1000). It calculates the final scores of each player across all rounds, identifies the player(s) with the highest score, and prints the name of the first player to reach or exceed the highest score. If there is a tie for the highest score, it ensures that the player who initially achieved the highest score first is identified. If no player meets the condition of having a score that reaches or exceeds the highest score, the function will not print anything.**

This summary covers the following aspects:
- The function processes the input to store the names and scores of players in a list of tuples.
- It calculates the total scores for each player using a `defaultdict`.
- It finds the maximum score among all players.
- It identifies the candidate(s) with the highest score.
- It recalculates the current scores of the players to determine if any of the candidates meet the condition of reaching or exceeding the highest score.
- It prints the name of the first player to reach or exceed the highest score, ensuring that the player who initially achieved the highest score first is identified if there is a tie.
- If no player meets the condition, the function does not print anything.
