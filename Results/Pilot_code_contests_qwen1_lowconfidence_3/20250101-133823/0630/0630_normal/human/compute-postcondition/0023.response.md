The code `break` does not affect the variables `rounds`, `curr_scores`, or `name`. It simply breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement. Since there is no such loop or conditional statement provided in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rounds` is `[('Alice', 10), ('Bob', 20), ('Charlie', 30)]`, `curr_scores` is `{'Bob': 20 + score}`, `name` is 'Bob' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
