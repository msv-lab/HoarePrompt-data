The code updates the value of `final_scores[name]` by adding `score` to it. Given the initial state, `name` is `'Bob'` and `score` is `20`. So, `final_scores['Bob']` (which is initially `20`) will be updated to `20 + 20 = 40`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `rounds`, `final_scores`, `name`, and `score`) remain unchanged except for `final_scores['Bob']`, which is now `40`.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `rounds` is `[('Alice', 10), ('Bob', 20), ('Charlie', 30)]`, `final_scores` is a defaultdict with default factory int and value `{'Alice': 10, 'Bob': 40}`, `name` is `'Bob'`, `score` is `20`**
