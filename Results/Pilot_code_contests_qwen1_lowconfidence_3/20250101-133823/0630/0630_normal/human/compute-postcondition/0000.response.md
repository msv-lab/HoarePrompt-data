The code `n = int(input())` assigns the integer value entered by the user to the variable `n`. This sets the number of rounds played. All other variables remain in their initial state, which means they are not yet assigned any values.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, indicating the number of rounds played; the input consists of an integer n indicating the number of rounds played, followed by n lines of text, each containing a player's name (a string of lowercase Latin letters with a length from 1 to 32) and a score (an integer between -1000 and 1000). The number of rounds played is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. At the end of the game, at least one player has a positive number of points, and there is a unique player or a tie for the highest score where one of the tied players had the highest score first.**
