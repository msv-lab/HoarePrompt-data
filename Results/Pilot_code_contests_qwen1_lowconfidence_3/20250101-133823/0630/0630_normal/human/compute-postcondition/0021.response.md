The code updates the score for the player named 'Bob' in the `curr_scores` dictionary. Since the initial state does not specify the exact contents of `curr_scores`, we assume that `curr_scores` initially does not contain any entries for 'Bob'. Therefore, when we add `score` to `curr_scores['Bob']`, `curr_scores` will now contain the key 'Bob' with its value being `20 + score`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state includes: `rounds` is `[('Alice', 10), ('Bob', 20), ('Charlie', 30)]`, `curr_scores` is a dictionary (initially empty or not containing 'Bob'), and `name` is 'Bob'.
2. The code snippet `curr_scores[name] += score` means we are adding `score` to the value associated with `name` in `curr_scores`.
3. Since `name` is 'Bob', this line of code adds `score` to the value of 'Bob' in `curr_scores`. Given that `curr_scores` initially did not have 'Bob' as a key, after this operation, `curr_scores` will be `{'Bob': 20 + score}`.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`rounds` is `[('Alice', 10), ('Bob', 20), ('Charlie', 30)]`, `curr_scores` is `{'Bob': 20 + score}`, `name` is 'Bob'**
