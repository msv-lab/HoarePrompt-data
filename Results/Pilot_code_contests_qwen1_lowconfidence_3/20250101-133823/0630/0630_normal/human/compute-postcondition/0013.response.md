The code `curr_scores = defaultdict(int)` creates a new dictionary named `curr_scores` with the default factory set to `int`. This means that any key not present in the dictionary will have a default value of `0`. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `rounds` is `[('Alice', 10), ('Bob', 20), ('Charlie', 30)]`, `final_scores` is a defaultdict with default factory int and value `{'Alice': 10, 'Bob': 40, 'Charlie': 60}`, `name` is the last name processed in the loop, `score` is the score associated with that name in the last round processed, `m` is 60, `winner_candidates` is `{'Charlie'}`, `curr_scores` is a defaultdict with default factory int and value `{}`**
