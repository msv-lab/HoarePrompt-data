The given code snippet is transforming the `rounds` list into a new list of tuples where each tuple contains a player's name and their score, both converted to integers. This means that for each sublist in the original `rounds` list, the code creates a new tuple where the second element (score) is now an integer.

Let's assume the initial state of `rounds` is as follows (since the exact input is not specified, we'll consider a general example):

Initial State: 
```python
n = 3
rounds = [['Alice', '10'], ['Bob', '20'], ['Charlie', '30']]
```

After executing the code snippet:
```python
rounds = [(name, int(score)) for name, score in rounds]
```

Each sublist in `rounds` is transformed into a tuple, and the score is converted to an integer. So the updated `rounds` will look like this:

```python
rounds = [('Alice', 10), ('Bob', 20), ('Charlie', 30)]
```

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is 3; `rounds` is `[('Alice', 10), ('Bob', 20), ('Charlie', 30)]`**
