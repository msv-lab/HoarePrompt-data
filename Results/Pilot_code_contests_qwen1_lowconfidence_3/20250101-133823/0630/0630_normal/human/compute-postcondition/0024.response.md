Postcondition: ***`rounds` remains as `[('Alice', 10), ('Bob', 20), ('Charlie', 30)]`, `curr_scores` remains as `{'Bob': 20 + score}`. If `curr_scores[name] >= m` and `name` is in `winner_candidates`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, nothing specific changes.***
