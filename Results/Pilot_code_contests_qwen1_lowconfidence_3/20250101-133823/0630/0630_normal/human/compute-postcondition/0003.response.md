The code initializes a dictionary `final_scores` using `defaultdict(int)`. This means that `final_scores` is a dictionary where each key maps to an integer value, and by default, if a key is not present, its value will be `0`.

- The variable `n` remains unchanged, so `n` is still `3`.
- The list `rounds` remains unchanged, so `rounds` is `[('Alice', 10), ('Bob', 20), ('Charlie', 30)]`.
- The `final_scores` dictionary is newly created but does not contain any entries yet.

Output State: **`n` is 3; `rounds` is `[('Alice', 10), ('Bob', 20), ('Charlie', 30)]`; `final_scores` is a defaultdict with default factory int**
