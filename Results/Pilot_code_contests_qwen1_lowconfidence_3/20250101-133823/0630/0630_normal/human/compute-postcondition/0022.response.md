The code `print(name)` simply prints the value of the variable `name`. Since the initial value of `name` is 'Bob', the print statement will output 'Bob'. However, the variable `name` itself does not change in value. The lists and dictionaries given in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rounds` is `[('Alice', 10), ('Bob', 20), ('Charlie', 30)]`, `curr_scores` is `{'Bob': 20 + score}`, `name` is 'Bob'**
