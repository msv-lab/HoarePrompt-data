Postcondition: **`rounds` remains as `[('Alice', 10), ('Bob', 20), ('Charlie', 30)]`; `curr_scores` is updated to include `curr_scores[name]` being increased by `score`; if `curr_scores[name] >= m` and `name` is in `winner_candidates`, then the value of `name` is printed and the most internal loop or nested structure is broken out of. If these conditions are not met, the program continues without any specific change in the printed value or loop state.**
