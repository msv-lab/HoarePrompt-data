n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, representing the number of rounds played. Each of the following n lines contains a player's name (a string of lower-case Latin letters with the length from 1 to 32) and an integer score (between -1000 and 1000, inclusive), representing the player's name and the number of points gained or lost in that round, respectively.
