The function accepts an integer `n` indicating the number of rounds played, followed by `n` lines of text. Each line contains a player's name (a string of lowercase Latin letters with a length from 1 to 32) and a score (an integer between -1000 and 1000). It calculates the final scores of each player across all rounds, identifies the player(s) with the highest score, and prints the name of the first player to reach or exceed the highest score. If there is a tie for the highest score, it ensures that the player who initially achieved the highest score first is identified. If no player meets the condition of having a score that reaches or exceeds the highest score, the function will not print anything.
