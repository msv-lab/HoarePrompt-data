Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the rules described for determining the winner of the "Berlogging" card game. It processes the input to calculate the final scores of each player and identifies the candidate winners who have the maximum number of points. Then, it checks through the rounds to find the first player among the candidates who achieved at least the maximum score. The program handles all the specified edge cases, including the possibility of multiple players having the same maximum score. Given the structure and logic of the code, it appears to meet the requirements for every potential case described in the problem statement.
