Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where multiple players have the maximum score at the same time but the winner is determined by the one who reached that score first. The program only prints the first player who reaches the maximum score, but it does not ensure that this player is the one who reached the maximum score first among all the candidates. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
player1 3
player2 5
player1 2
player2 2
```

According to the problem description, `player2` should win because they reached the maximum score of 7 first. However, the program will incorrectly print `player1` because they reached the score of 5 first. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
