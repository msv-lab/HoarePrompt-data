You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The winner of the card game popular in Berland "Berlogging" is determined according to the following rules. If at the end of the game there is only one player with the maximum number of points, he is the winner. The situation becomes more difficult if the number of such players is more than one. During each round a player gains or loses a particular number of points. In the course of the game the number of points is registered in the line "name score", where name is a player's name, and score is the number of points gained in this round, which is an integer number. If score is negative, this means that the player has lost in the round. So, if two or more players have the maximum number of points (say, it equals to m) at the end of the game, than wins the one of them who scored at least m points first. Initially each player has 0 points. It's guaranteed that at the end of the game at least one player has a positive number of points.

Input

The first line contains an integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), n is the number of rounds played. Then follow n lines, containing the information about the rounds in "name score" format in chronological order, where name is a string of lower-case Latin letters with the length from 1 to 32, and score is an integer number between -1000 and 1000, inclusive.

Output

Print the name of the winner.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
import io
import os
import sys
from collections import defaultdict

if sys.version_info[0] < 3:
    from __builtin__ import xrange as range
    from cStringIO import StringIO
    from future_builtins import ascii, filter, hex, map, oct, zip
else:
    from io import BytesIO as StringIO
(sys.stdout, stream) = (io.IOBase(), StringIO())
sys.stdout.flush = lambda : os.write(1, stream.getvalue()) and (not stream.truncate(0)) and stream.seek(0)
sys.stdout.write = stream.write if sys.version_info[0] < 3 else lambda s: stream.write(s.encode())
(input, flush) = (sys.stdin.readline, sys.stdout.flush)
input = StringIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer n indicating the number of rounds played, followed by n lines of text, each containing a player's name (a string of lowercase Latin letters with a length from 1 to 32) and a score (an integer between -1000 and 1000). The number of rounds played is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. At the end of the game, at least one player has a positive number of points, and there is a unique player or a tie for the highest score where one of the tied players had the highest score first.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    rounds = [input().split() for _ in range(n)]
    rounds = [(name, int(score)) for name, score in rounds]
    final_scores = defaultdict(int)
    for (name, score) in rounds:
        final_scores[name] += score
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is 3, `rounds` is `[('Alice', 10), ('Bob', 20), ('Charlie', 30)]`, `final_scores` is a defaultdict with default factory int and value `{'Alice': 10, 'Bob': 40, 'Charlie': 60}`, `name` is the last name processed in the loop, `score` is the score associated with that name in the last round processed.
    m = max(final_scores.values())
    winner_candidates = {player for player, score in final_scores.items() if 
    score == m}
    curr_scores = defaultdict(int)
    for (name, score) in rounds:
        curr_scores[name] += score
        
        if curr_scores[name] >= m and name in winner_candidates:
            print(name)
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `rounds` is `[('Alice', 10), ('Bob', 20), ('Charlie', 30)]`, `curr_scores` is a dictionary where each name's score is the sum of their respective scores from `rounds`, `name` is the last name processed, `score` is the last score processed, `m` is 60, `winner_candidates` is `{'Charlie'}`, and if `curr_scores['Charlie']` is greater than or equal to 60, the name `Charlie` will be printed, otherwise, the loop will finish without printing anything.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` indicating the number of rounds played, followed by `n` lines of text. Each line contains a player's name (a string of lowercase Latin letters with a length from 1 to 32) and a score (an integer between -1000 and 1000). It calculates the final scores of each player across all rounds, identifies the player(s) with the highest score, and prints the name of the first player to reach or exceed the highest score. If there is a tie for the highest score, it ensures that the player who initially achieved the highest score first is identified. If no player meets the condition of having a score that reaches or exceeds the highest score, the function will not print anything.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
