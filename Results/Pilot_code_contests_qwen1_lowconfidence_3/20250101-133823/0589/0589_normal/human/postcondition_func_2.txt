The function `func_3()` accepts a string `s` consisting of digits as input and returns a list containing the first three characters of `s`. If the input string `s` has fewer than three characters, the function will still attempt to create a list with the available characters, which could result in a list with fewer than three elements. If `s` has more than three characters, only the first three will be included in the returned list.
