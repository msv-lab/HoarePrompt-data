The function `func_5` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers within the range [l, r] such that a != b. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function enters a loop where it repeatedly updates `a` and `b` using the modulus operation until `a` becomes zero. At this point, `b` contains the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function then returns `b`. This process handles the case where `a` and `b` are swapped during the loop, ensuring that the final value of `b` is the GCD. Potential edge cases include when `a` and `b` are equal (though the function assumes `a != b`), and when `a` or `b` is 1, in which case the GCD will also be 1. The function correctly computes the GCD and returns it, regardless of the initial values of `a` and `b` within the specified range.
