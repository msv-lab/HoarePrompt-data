#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input provided by the user between l and r (inclusive)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function prompts the user to input an integer value between the given non-negative integers `l` and `r` (inclusive). It then returns this integer input provided by the user. The function ensures that the input is within the specified range. If the user provides an input outside the range, the function will continue to prompt until a valid input is given.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string, which is the result of user input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and waits for user input. It then splits the input string into multiple substrings based on whitespace and converts each substring into an integer, returning a list of these integers. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function assumes that the user input can be split into valid integers. If the user input contains non-integer values or no values at all, the function will raise a `ValueError`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of digits, and the length of s is at least 3.
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s)])
    #The program returns a list containing the first three characters of the input string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` accepts a string `s` consisting of digits as input and returns a list containing the first three characters of `s`. If the input string `s` has fewer than three characters, the function will still attempt to create a list with the available characters, which could result in a list with fewer than three elements. If `s` has more than three characters, only the first three will be included in the returned list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object created from converting the input split by spaces into integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input and returns a map object containing these integers. The function expects the input to consist of integers separated by spaces. If the input does not meet this requirement (e.g., contains non-integer values or is not separated by spaces), the function will still attempt to convert the input but may result in a `ValueError`. There is no validation to ensure that the input strictly follows the specified constraints (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers where a != b and both are within the range [l, r] such that l ≤ a < b ≤ r.
def func_5(a, b):
    while a % b > 0:
        c = a % b
        
        a = b
        
        b = c
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is 0, `b` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `c` is 0
    return b
    #The program returns b which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of a and b
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers within the range [l, r] such that a != b. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function enters a loop where it repeatedly updates `a` and `b` using the modulus operation until `a` becomes zero. At this point, `b` contains the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function then returns `b`. This process handles the case where `a` and `b` are swapped during the loop, ensuring that the final value of `b` is the GCD. Potential edge cases include when `a` and `b` are equal (though the function assumes `a != b`), and when `a` or `b` is 1, in which case the GCD will also be 1. The function correctly computes the GCD and returns it, regardless of the initial values of `a` and `b` within the specified range.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_6(l, r):
    for a in range(l, r + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
            if func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a) != 1:
                return a, b, r
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is the largest integer such that `l <= a < r` and there does not exist an integer `b` where `a < b <= r` and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, `b` is the smallest integer greater than `a` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \geq 1\).
    return -1, -1, -1
    #-1, -1, -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, where both are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \leq 50\). The function searches for three integers `a`, `b`, and `r` that satisfy certain conditions involving the function `func_5`. Specifically:

- If `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1` for some `a` and `b`, the function returns `a`, `b`, and `r`.
- If no such `a`, `b`, and `r` are found, the function returns `-1`, `-1`, `-1`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `func_5` is already defined and works correctly. If `func_5` is not defined or does not work as expected, the behavior of `func_6` is undefined.
- The function does not handle the case where `l == r`. In this scenario, no valid `a` and `b` can be found since the range `[l, r)` would be empty, leading to a return of `-1`, `-1`, `-1`.
- The function does not provide a detailed description of the conditions under which each case (e.g., Case_1, Case_2, etc.) applies. While the return postconditions are provided, the exact logic for determining which case to apply is not clear from the given annotations.
- The function does not explicitly handle the scenario where `l` and `r` are very close to the upper limit of \(10^{18}\), although this is unlikely due to the constraint \(r - l \leq 50\).

After the function concludes, the return value will be either a tuple `(a, b, r)` where `a` is less than `r`, `b` is greater than `a` and satisfies the conditions related to `func_5`, or a tuple `(-1, -1, -1)` indicating no valid integers were found.
