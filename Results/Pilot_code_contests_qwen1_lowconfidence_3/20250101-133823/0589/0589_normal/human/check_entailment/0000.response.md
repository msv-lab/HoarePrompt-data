Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program is designed to find three numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(l \leq a < b < c \leq r\), where pairs \((a, b)\) and \((b, c)\) are coprime, but pair \((a, c)\) is not coprime. However, the implementation of this logic is flawed.

The issue lies in the inner loop of `func_6`. The condition `func_5(b, a) != 1` checks if \(a\) and \(b\) are not coprime, which is incorrect. It should check if \(b\) and \(c\) are not coprime. The correct condition should be `func_5(c, b) != 1`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_6(l, r):
    for a in range(l, r + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
            for c in range(b + 1, r + 1):
                if func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(c, b) != 1:
                    return (a, b, c)
    return (-1, -1, -1)
```

The original program fails to meet the problem requirements because it does not correctly check the coprimality conditions for the required pairs. The provided implementation does not ensure that \(b\) and \(c\) are not coprime, leading to incorrect results.
