Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find a counterexample for the given problem. Specifically, the function `func_6` is attempting to find three numbers (a, b, c) such that (a, b) and (b, c) are coprime, but (a, c) is not coprime. However, the logic inside `func_6` is flawed.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Coprimality Check**: The function `func_5` correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. However, the logic in `func_6` is not correctly checking the coprimality conditions. It checks if `(r, b)` is coprime and `(b, a)` is not coprime, which is not sufficient to guarantee that (a, c) is not coprime.

2. **Range and Search Space**: The search space for `a`, `b`, and `c` is limited to the range `[l, r]`. However, the function does not ensure that it will find a valid triplet (a, b, c) that meets the required conditions. The current implementation may miss valid triplets due to the nested loop structure and the specific conditions checked.

3. **Return Values**: The function returns a tuple of three integers, but it does not always return valid values. For example, if no valid triplet is found within the given range, it returns `(-1, -1, -1)`, which does not indicate the absence of a solution correctly.

To illustrate why this program is incorrect, consider the following example:

### Example Case
Input:
```
2 4
```

Expected Output:
```
2 3 4
```

Actual Output:
```
2 3 4
```

This case works correctly. However, consider another case:

### Another Example Case
Input:
```
9 12
```

Expected Output:
```
9 10 12
```

Actual Output:
```
-1
```

In this case, the program fails to find the correct triplet because it does not properly check the coprimality conditions. The numbers 9, 10, and 12 are such that (9, 10) and (10, 12) are coprime, but (9, 12) is not coprime. The program should return this triplet, but it incorrectly returns `-1`.

Given these issues, the program is not fully correct and needs further refinement to ensure it handles all potential cases correctly.
