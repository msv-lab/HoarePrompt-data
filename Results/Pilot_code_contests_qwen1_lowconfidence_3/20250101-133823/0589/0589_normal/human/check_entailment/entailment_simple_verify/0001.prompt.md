You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Your friend has recently learned about coprime numbers. A pair of numbers {a, b} is called coprime if the maximum number that divides both a and b is equal to one. 

Your friend often comes up with different statements. He has recently supposed that if the pair (a, b) is coprime and the pair (b, c) is coprime, then the pair (a, c) is coprime. 

You want to find a counterexample for your friend's statement. Therefore, your task is to find three distinct numbers (a, b, c), for which the statement is false, and the numbers meet the condition l ≤ a < b < c ≤ r. 

More specifically, you need to find three numbers (a, b, c), such that l ≤ a < b < c ≤ r, pairs (a, b) and (b, c) are coprime, and pair (a, c) is not coprime.

Input

The single line contains two positive space-separated integers l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 1018; r - l ≤ 50).

Output

Print three positive space-separated integers a, b, c — three distinct numbers (a, b, c) that form the counterexample. If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them. The numbers must be printed in ascending order. 

If the counterexample does not exist, print the single number -1.

Examples

Input

2 4


Output

2 3 4


Input

10 11


Output

-1


Input

900000000000000009 900000000000000029


Output

900000000000000009 900000000000000010 900000000000000021

Note

In the first sample pair (2, 4) is not coprime and pairs (2, 3) and (3, 4) are. 

In the second sample you cannot form a group of three distinct integers, so the answer is -1. 

In the third sample it is easy to see that numbers 900000000000000009 and 900000000000000021 are divisible by three.

            if func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a) != 1:
                return (a, b, r)
    return (-1, -1, -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find a counterexample for the given problem. Specifically, the function `func_6` is attempting to find three numbers (a, b, c) such that (a, b) and (b, c) are coprime, but (a, c) is not coprime. However, the logic inside `func_6` is flawed.

Here’s a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Coprimality Check**: The function `func_5` correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. However, the logic in `func_6` is not correctly checking the coprimality conditions. It checks if `(r, b)` is coprime and `(b, a)` is not coprime, which is not sufficient to guarantee that (a, c) is not coprime.

2. **Range and Search Space**: The search space for `a`, `b`, and `c` is limited to the range `[l, r]`. However, the function does not ensure that it will find a valid triplet (a, b, c) that meets the required conditions. The current implementation may miss valid triplets due to the nested loop structure and the specific conditions checked.

3. **Return Values**: The function returns a tuple of three integers, but it does not always return valid values. For example, if no valid triplet is found within the given range, it returns `(-1, -1, -1)`, which does not indicate the absence of a solution correctly.

To illustrate why this program is incorrect, consider the following example:

### Example Case
Input:
```
2 4
```

Expected Output:
```
2 3 4
```

Actual Output:
```
2 3 4
```

This case works correctly. However, consider another case:

### Another Example Case
Input:
```
9 12
```

Expected Output:
```
9 10 12
```

Actual Output:
```
-1
```

In this case, the program fails to find the correct triplet because it does not properly check the coprimality conditions. The numbers 9, 10, and 12 are such that (9, 10) and (10, 12) are coprime, but (9, 12) is not coprime. The program should return this triplet, but it incorrectly returns `-1`.

Given these issues, the program is not fully correct and needs further refinement to ensure it handles all potential cases correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
