Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. Here are the key points that support this conclusion:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Coprimality Check**: The function `func_5` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. However, the logic in `func_6` is flawed. The program checks if `(r, b)` is coprime and `(b, a)` is not coprime, which is insufficient to guarantee that `(a, c)` is not coprime. This logic does not cover all possible scenarios where `(a, c)` might be coprime even if `(a, b)` and `(b, c)` are coprime.

2. **Search Space and Conditions**: The nested loops in `func_6` iterate through the range `[l, r]` to find a valid triplet (a, b, c). However, the conditions used to check the coprimality do not ensure that `(a, c)` is not coprime. For example, in the case where `l = 9` and `r = 12`, the program fails to find the correct triplet (9, 10, 12) because it does not properly handle the conditions.

3. **Return Values**: The function `func_6` returns a tuple of three integers, but it does not always return valid values. If no valid triplet is found, it returns `(-1, -1, -1)`, which does not indicate the absence of a solution correctly. This can lead to incorrect outputs in some cases.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find a counterexample for the given problem. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is accurate.
