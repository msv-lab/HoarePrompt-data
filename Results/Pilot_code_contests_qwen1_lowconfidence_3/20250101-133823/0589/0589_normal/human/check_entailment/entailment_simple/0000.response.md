Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find a counterexample to the statement about coprime numbers. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Function Definitions**:
   - **Function 5 (`func_5`)**: This function is intended to calculate the GCD of two numbers. However, its implementation is flawed. It uses a loop to repeatedly update `a` and `b` until `a % b == 0`, which is not the correct way to compute the GCD. The correct approach should use the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with `a % b` until `b` becomes 0.
   - **Function 6 (`func_6`)**: This function aims to find three numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that the pairs \((a, b)\) and \((b, c)\) are coprime, but \(a\) and \(c\) are not. However, the logic inside this function does not guarantee finding such numbers. Specifically, it checks if \((b, a) \neq 1\) after ensuring \((r, b) = 1\), which doesn’t necessarily mean \((a, c) \neq 1\).

2. **Logical Flaws**:
   - **Finding Coprime Pairs**: The function `func_5` should return the GCD of `a` and `b`, but the logic in `func_6` does not ensure that the conditions for coprimality are met correctly.
   - **Counterexample Search**: The function `func_6` does not properly search for the required counterexample. It only checks a limited range of values and does not exhaustively search for suitable \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases effectively. For example, if the input range is small, the function might not find a valid counterexample due to the limited search space.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you would need to implement the following steps:

1. **Compute GCD**: Use the Euclidean algorithm to correctly compute the GCD.
2. **Search for Counterexample**: Iterate over possible values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within the given range, ensuring that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are distinct and satisfy the coprimality conditions.

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func_5(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def func_6(l, r):
    for a in range(l, r):
        for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
            if func_5(a, b) == 1:
                for c in range(b + 1, r + 1):
                    if func_5(a, c) != 1:
                        return a, b, c
    return -1, -1, -1

def main():
    (l, r) = func_2()
    if func_5(r, l) == 1:
        (a, b, c) = func_6(l, r)
        if a == -1:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(a, b, c)
    else:
        print(l, l + 1, r)

# Function definitions as provided
# ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version ensures that the GCD is computed correctly and searches for a valid counterexample within the specified range.
