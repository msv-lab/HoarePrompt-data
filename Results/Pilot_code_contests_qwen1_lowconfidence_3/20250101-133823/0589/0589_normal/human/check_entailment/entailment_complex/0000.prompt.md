You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Your friend has recently learned about coprime numbers. A pair of numbers {a, b} is called coprime if the maximum number that divides both a and b is equal to one. 

Your friend often comes up with different statements. He has recently supposed that if the pair (a, b) is coprime and the pair (b, c) is coprime, then the pair (a, c) is coprime. 

You want to find a counterexample for your friend's statement. Therefore, your task is to find three distinct numbers (a, b, c), for which the statement is false, and the numbers meet the condition l ≤ a < b < c ≤ r. 

More specifically, you need to find three numbers (a, b, c), such that l ≤ a < b < c ≤ r, pairs (a, b) and (b, c) are coprime, and pair (a, c) is not coprime.

Input

The single line contains two positive space-separated integers l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 1018; r - l ≤ 50).

Output

Print three positive space-separated integers a, b, c — three distinct numbers (a, b, c) that form the counterexample. If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them. The numbers must be printed in ascending order. 

If the counterexample does not exist, print the single number -1.

Examples

Input

2 4


Output

2 3 4


Input

10 11


Output

-1


Input

900000000000000009 900000000000000029


Output

900000000000000009 900000000000000010 900000000000000021

Note

In the first sample pair (2, 4) is not coprime and pairs (2, 3) and (3, 4) are. 

In the second sample you cannot form a group of three distinct integers, so the answer is -1. 

In the third sample it is easy to see that numbers 900000000000000009 and 900000000000000021 are divisible by three.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input provided by the user between l and r (inclusive)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function prompts the user to input an integer value between the given non-negative integers `l` and `r` (inclusive). It then returns this integer input provided by the user. The function ensures that the input is within the specified range. If the user provides an input outside the range, the function will continue to prompt until a valid input is given.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string, which is the result of user input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and waits for user input. It then splits the input string into multiple substrings based on whitespace and converts each substring into an integer, returning a list of these integers. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function assumes that the user input can be split into valid integers. If the user input contains non-integer values or no values at all, the function will raise a `ValueError`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of digits, and the length of s is at least 3.
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s)])
    #The program returns a list containing the first three characters of the input string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` accepts a string `s` consisting of digits as input and returns a list containing the first three characters of `s`. If the input string `s` has fewer than three characters, the function will still attempt to create a list with the available characters, which could result in a list with fewer than three elements. If `s` has more than three characters, only the first three will be included in the returned list.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object created from converting the input split by spaces into integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input and returns a map object containing these integers. The function expects the input to consist of integers separated by spaces. If the input does not meet this requirement (e.g., contains non-integer values or is not separated by spaces), the function will still attempt to convert the input but may result in a `ValueError`. There is no validation to ensure that the input strictly follows the specified constraints (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50).

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers where a != b and both are within the range [l, r] such that l ≤ a < b ≤ r.
def func_5(a, b):
    while a % b > 0:
        c = a % b
        
        a = b
        
        b = c
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is 0, `b` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `c` is 0
    return b
    #The program returns b which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of a and b
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers within the range [l, r] such that a != b. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function enters a loop where it repeatedly updates `a` and `b` using the modulus operation until `a` becomes zero. At this point, `b` contains the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function then returns `b`. This process handles the case where `a` and `b` are swapped during the loop, ensuring that the final value of `b` is the GCD. Potential edge cases include when `a` and `b` are equal (though the function assumes `a != b`), and when `a` or `b` is 1, in which case the GCD will also be 1. The function correctly computes the GCD and returns it, regardless of the initial values of `a` and `b` within the specified range.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_6(l, r):
    for a in range(l, r + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
            if func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a) != 1:
                return a, b, r
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is the largest integer such that `l <= a < r` and there does not exist an integer `b` where `a < b <= r` and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, `b` is the smallest integer greater than `a` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \geq 1\).
    return -1, -1, -1
    #-1, -1, -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, where both are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \leq 50\). The function searches for three integers `a`, `b`, and `r` that satisfy certain conditions involving the function `func_5`. Specifically:

- If `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1` for some `a` and `b`, the function returns `a`, `b`, and `r`.
- If no such `a`, `b`, and `r` are found, the function returns `-1`, `-1`, `-1`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `func_5` is already defined and works correctly. If `func_5` is not defined or does not work as expected, the behavior of `func_6` is undefined.
- The function does not handle the case where `l == r`. In this scenario, no valid `a` and `b` can be found since the range `[l, r)` would be empty, leading to a return of `-1`, `-1`, `-1`.
- The function does not provide a detailed description of the conditions under which each case (e.g., Case_1, Case_2, etc.) applies. While the return postconditions are provided, the exact logic for determining which case to apply is not clear from the given annotations.
- The function does not explicitly handle the scenario where `l` and `r` are very close to the upper limit of \(10^{18}\), although this is unlikely due to the constraint \(r - l \leq 50\).

After the function concludes, the return value will be either a tuple `(a, b, r)` where `a` is less than `r`, `b` is greater than `a` and satisfies the conditions related to `func_5`, or a tuple `(-1, -1, -1)` indicating no valid integers were found.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
