Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_6` does not handle the case where `l == r`. According to the problem description, the range `[l, r)` must contain at least three distinct numbers. However, if `l == r`, the range `[l, r)` is empty, and thus, no valid triplet `(a, b, c)` can be found. The function returns `(-1, -1, -1)` in this case, which is not a valid triplet as per the problem statement.

For example, if the input is `10 10`, the function will return `(-1, -1, -1)`, which does not satisfy the requirement of having three distinct numbers. Therefore, the code is not correct for every potential case as described in the problem statement.
