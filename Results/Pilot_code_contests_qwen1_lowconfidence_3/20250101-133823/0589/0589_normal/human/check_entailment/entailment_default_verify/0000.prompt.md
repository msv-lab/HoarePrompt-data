You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Your friend has recently learned about coprime numbers. A pair of numbers {a, b} is called coprime if the maximum number that divides both a and b is equal to one. 

Your friend often comes up with different statements. He has recently supposed that if the pair (a, b) is coprime and the pair (b, c) is coprime, then the pair (a, c) is coprime. 

You want to find a counterexample for your friend's statement. Therefore, your task is to find three distinct numbers (a, b, c), for which the statement is false, and the numbers meet the condition l ≤ a < b < c ≤ r. 

More specifically, you need to find three numbers (a, b, c), such that l ≤ a < b < c ≤ r, pairs (a, b) and (b, c) are coprime, and pair (a, c) is not coprime.

Input

The single line contains two positive space-separated integers l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 1018; r - l ≤ 50).

Output

Print three positive space-separated integers a, b, c — three distinct numbers (a, b, c) that form the counterexample. If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them. The numbers must be printed in ascending order. 

If the counterexample does not exist, print the single number -1.

Examples

Input

2 4


Output

2 3 4


Input

10 11


Output

-1


Input

900000000000000009 900000000000000029


Output

900000000000000009 900000000000000010 900000000000000021

Note

In the first sample pair (2, 4) is not coprime and pairs (2, 3) and (3, 4) are. 

In the second sample you cannot form a group of three distinct integers, so the answer is -1. 

In the third sample it is easy to see that numbers 900000000000000009 and 900000000000000021 are divisible by three. 
Program:
```
import os
import sys
from atexit import register
from io import BytesIO
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    return int(input())

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s)])

#Function 4:
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().split())

#Function 5:
def func_5(a, b):
    while a % b > 0:
        c = a % b
        a = b
        b = c
    return b

#Function 6:
def func_6(l, r):
    for a in range(l, r + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
            if func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a) != 1:
                return (a, b, r)
    return (-1, -1, -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program is designed to find three numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(l \leq a < b < c \leq r\), where pairs \((a, b)\) and \((b, c)\) are coprime, but pair \((a, c)\) is not coprime. However, the implementation of this logic is flawed.

The issue lies in the inner loop of `func_6`. The condition `func_5(b, a) != 1` checks if \(a\) and \(b\) are not coprime, which is incorrect. It should check if \(b\) and \(c\) are not coprime. The correct condition should be `func_5(c, b) != 1`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_6(l, r):
    for a in range(l, r + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
            for c in range(b + 1, r + 1):
                if func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(c, b) != 1:
                    return (a, b, c)
    return (-1, -1, -1)
```

The original program fails to meet the problem requirements because it does not correctly check the coprimality conditions for the required pairs. The provided implementation does not ensure that \(b\) and \(c\) are not coprime, leading to incorrect results.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 6 : The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, where both are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \leq 50\). The function searches for three integers `a`, `b`, and `r` that satisfy certain conditions involving the function `func_5`. Specifically:

- If `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1` for some `a` and `b`, the function returns `a`, `b`, and `r`.
- If no such `a`, `b`, and `r` are found, the function returns `-1`, `-1`, `-1`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `func_5` is already defined and works correctly. If `func_5` is not defined or does not work as expected, the behavior of `func_6` is undefined.
- The function does not handle the case where `l == r`. In this scenario, no valid `a` and `b` can be found since the range `[l, r)` would be empty, leading to a return of `-1`, `-1`, `-1`.
- The function does not provide a detailed description of the conditions under which each case (e.g., Case_1, Case_2, etc.) applies. While the return postconditions are provided, the exact logic for determining which case to apply is not clear from the given annotations.
- The function does not explicitly handle the scenario where `l` and `r` are very close to the upper limit of \(10^{18}\), although this is unlikely due to the constraint \(r - l \leq 50\).

After the function concludes, the return value will be either a tuple `(a, b, r)` where `a` is less than `r`, `b` is greater than `a` and satisfies the conditions related to `func_5`, or a tuple `(-1, -1, -1)` indicating no valid integers were found.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
