Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the provided output hints and the original assessment, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find a counterexample for the given problem. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Coprimality Check**: The function `func_6` attempts to find three numbers (a, b, c) such that (a, b) and (b, c) are coprime, but (a, c) is not coprime. However, the current implementation does not correctly check these conditions. It checks if `(r, b)` is coprime and `(b, a)` is not coprime, which is not sufficient to guarantee that (a, c) is not coprime.

2. **Edge Cases Not Properly Handled**: The program does not handle certain edge cases such as when `l == r`, which would lead to an empty range and return `-1, -1, -1`. Additionally, the program does not thoroughly explore all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` within the given constraints, potentially missing valid triplets.

3. **Lack of Detailed Conditions**: The output hints mention potential edge cases and missing functionality, indicating that the program's logic is incomplete and may fail to handle certain scenarios correctly.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is not fully correct.
