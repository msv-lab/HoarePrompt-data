Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not fully address the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_6` does not handle the case where `l == r`. Since the range `[l, r)` would be empty in this case, the function returns `(-1, -1, -1)`, which does not satisfy the requirement of finding three distinct numbers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that `l ≤ a < b < c ≤ r`. This oversight means the program does not work correctly for the case where the lower and upper bounds are the same, violating the problem description.
