Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where \( l == r \). According to the problem description, if the range \([l, r]\) is empty (i.e., \( l == r \)), there are no valid integers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) that can form a counterexample. However, the code in `func_6` does not account for this scenario, leading to the return of \((-1, -1, -1)\) in this case. This violates the requirement that the program should return \(-1\) if no valid counterexample exists, rather than attempting to find one in an empty range. Thus, the code is not correct for every potential case.
