You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Your friend has recently learned about coprime numbers. A pair of numbers {a, b} is called coprime if the maximum number that divides both a and b is equal to one. 

Your friend often comes up with different statements. He has recently supposed that if the pair (a, b) is coprime and the pair (b, c) is coprime, then the pair (a, c) is coprime. 

You want to find a counterexample for your friend's statement. Therefore, your task is to find three distinct numbers (a, b, c), for which the statement is false, and the numbers meet the condition l ≤ a < b < c ≤ r. 

More specifically, you need to find three numbers (a, b, c), such that l ≤ a < b < c ≤ r, pairs (a, b) and (b, c) are coprime, and pair (a, c) is not coprime.

Input

The single line contains two positive space-separated integers l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 1018; r - l ≤ 50).

Output

Print three positive space-separated integers a, b, c — three distinct numbers (a, b, c) that form the counterexample. If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them. The numbers must be printed in ascending order. 

If the counterexample does not exist, print the single number -1.

Examples

Input

2 4


Output

2 3 4


Input

10 11


Output

-1


Input

900000000000000009 900000000000000029


Output

900000000000000009 900000000000000010 900000000000000021

Note

In the first sample pair (2, 4) is not coprime and pairs (2, 3) and (3, 4) are. 

In the second sample you cannot form a group of three distinct integers, so the answer is -1. 

In the third sample it is easy to see that numbers 900000000000000009 and 900000000000000021 are divisible by three. 
Functions with output description for each function:
import os
import sys
from atexit import register
from io import BytesIO

sys.stdin = BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size))
sys.stdout = BytesIO()
register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
(l, r) = func_2()
if func_5(r, l) == 1:
    (a, b, c) = func_6(l, r)
    if a == -1:
        sys.stdout.write('-1\n')
    sys.stdout.write(str(a) + ' ' + str(b) + ' ' + str(c) + '\n')
else:
    sys.stdout.write(str(l) + ' ' + str(l + 1) + ' ' + str(r) + '\n')

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function prompts the user to input an integer value between the given non-negative integers `l` and `r` (inclusive). It then returns this integer input provided by the user. The function ensures that the input is within the specified range. If the user provides an input outside the range, the function will continue to prompt until a valid input is given.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and waits for user input. It then splits the input string into multiple substrings based on whitespace and converts each substring into an integer, returning a list of these integers. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function assumes that the user input can be split into valid integers. If the user input contains non-integer values or no values at all, the function will raise a `ValueError`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s)])
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3()` accepts a string `s` consisting of digits as input and returns a list containing the first three characters of `s`. If the input string `s` has fewer than three characters, the function will still attempt to create a list with the available characters, which could result in a list with fewer than three elements. If `s` has more than three characters, only the first three will be included in the returned list.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input and returns a map object containing these integers. The function expects the input to consist of integers separated by spaces. If the input does not meet this requirement (e.g., contains non-integer values or is not separated by spaces), the function will still attempt to convert the input but may result in a `ValueError`. There is no validation to ensure that the input strictly follows the specified constraints (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50).
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(a, b):
    while a % b > 0:
        c = a % b
        a = b
        b = c
    return b
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers within the range [l, r] such that a != b. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function enters a loop where it repeatedly updates `a` and `b` using the modulus operation until `a` becomes zero. At this point, `b` contains the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function then returns `b`. This process handles the case where `a` and `b` are swapped during the loop, ensuring that the final value of `b` is the GCD. Potential edge cases include when `a` and `b` are equal (though the function assumes `a != b`), and when `a` or `b` is 1, in which case the GCD will also be 1. The function correctly computes the GCD and returns it, regardless of the initial values of `a` and `b` within the specified range.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(l, r):
    for a in range(l, r + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
            if func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a) != 1:
                return (a, b, r)
    return (-1, -1, -1)
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, where both are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \leq 50\). The function searches for three integers `a`, `b`, and `r` that satisfy certain conditions involving the function `func_5`. Specifically:

- If `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1` for some `a` and `b`, the function returns `a`, `b`, and `r`.
- If no such `a`, `b`, and `r` are found, the function returns `-1`, `-1`, `-1`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `func_5` is already defined and works correctly. If `func_5` is not defined or does not work as expected, the behavior of `func_6` is undefined.
- The function does not handle the case where `l == r`. In this scenario, no valid `a` and `b` can be found since the range `[l, r)` would be empty, leading to a return of `-1`, `-1`, `-1`.
- The function does not provide a detailed description of the conditions under which each case (e.g., Case_1, Case_2, etc.) applies. While the return postconditions are provided, the exact logic for determining which case to apply is not clear from the given annotations.
- The function does not explicitly handle the scenario where `l` and `r` are very close to the upper limit of \(10^{18}\), although this is unlikely due to the constraint \(r - l \leq 50\).

After the function concludes, the return value will be either a tuple `(a, b, r)` where `a` is less than `r`, `b` is greater than `a` and satisfies the conditions related to `func_5`, or a tuple `(-1, -1, -1)` indicating no valid integers were found.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
