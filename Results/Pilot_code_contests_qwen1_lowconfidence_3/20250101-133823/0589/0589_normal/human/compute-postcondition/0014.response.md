Postcondition: **`a` is an integer such that \( l \leq a < r \), and there exists an integer `b` such that \( a + 1 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, and the range `a + 1` to `r` must contain at least one valid `b` and the if condition `(func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a) != 1)` is true.**
