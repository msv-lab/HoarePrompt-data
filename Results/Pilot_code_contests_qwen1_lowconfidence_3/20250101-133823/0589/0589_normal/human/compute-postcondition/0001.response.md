According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a` and `r`. The loop starts from `b = a + 1` and increments `b` until `b` reaches `r + 1`. For the loop to execute, `a` must be less than `r`.

Given the initial states:
- `l` is a non-negative integer.
- `r` is a non-negative integer.
- \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\).
- \(r - l \geq 1\).

The key points to ensure the loop executes are:
1. `a` must be less than `r` (since the loop starts from `a + 1` and goes up to `r`).
2. `r` must be greater than or equal to `a + 1` (to ensure the loop has something to iterate over).

Since the initial state does not specify the value of `a`, we need to adjust it to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`l` is a non-negative integer, `r` is a non-negative integer, \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\), \(r - l \geq 1\), `a` must be less than `r`**
