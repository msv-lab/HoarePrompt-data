Let's break down the given for loop and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given for loop:
```
for a in range(l, r + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The key points to consider for the loop to execute are:
1. The variable `a` should be within the range defined by `l` and `r`.
2. The range `range(l, r + 1)` should contain at least one element for the loop to run.

From the initial state:
- `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \leq 50\).

To ensure the loop can execute:
- `l` must be less than or equal to `r`, as required by the condition \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\).
- `r - l` must be greater than or equal to 1 to ensure there is at least one integer in the range `[l, r]`.

So, we need to ensure that the range `[l, r]` contains at least one integer. This means \(l\) must be strictly less than or equal to \(r\), and since the difference \(r - l \leq 50\), it guarantees there is at least one integer in the range.

State: **`l` is a non-negative integer, `r` is a non-negative integer, \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\), and \(r - l \geq 1\)**
