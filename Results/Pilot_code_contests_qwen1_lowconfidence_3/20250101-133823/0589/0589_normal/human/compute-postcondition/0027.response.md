Output State: **The program returns `a` such that \( l \leq a + 1 < r \) and there does not exist an integer `b` such that \( a + 2 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`, and `a + 1 < r`, along with `b` and `r` where `b` satisfies the conditions mentioned and `r` is as defined in the initial state**.
