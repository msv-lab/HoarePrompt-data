Postcondition: ***`a` remains unchanged, `b` is set to `a + 2`, and the condition that there should not exist an integer `b` such that `a + 1 < b â‰¤ r` and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1` must still hold true for `b = a + 2`. If `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1` is true, the function returns `a, b, r`. Otherwise, `b` is set to `a + 2` and the condition holds.***
