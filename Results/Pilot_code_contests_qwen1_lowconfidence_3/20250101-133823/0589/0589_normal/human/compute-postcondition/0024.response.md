To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and the current state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a` is an integer such that \( l \leq a < r \).
- There does not exist an integer `b` such that \( a + 1 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over integers from `l` to `r + 1` (inclusive). Therefore, for the loop to continue, the value of `a` must satisfy \( l \leq a < r \).

2. **Current Value of `a`**:
   - According to the given condition, `a` is already within the valid range \( l \leq a < r \).

3. **Non-Existence of `b`**:
   - The non-existence of `b` satisfying \( a + 1 < b \leq r \) and the given function conditions means that for all integers `b` in this range, either `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a + 1) == 1`.

### Determining the Next State:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must increment by 1, making it `a + 1`.
- The new value of `a` must still satisfy \( l \leq a < r \).

Given that `a` is currently in the range \( l \leq a < r \), the next value of `a` would be `a + 1`. 

However, we need to ensure that `a + 1` still satisfies the non-existence condition:
- We need to check if `a + 1` is within the range and if there is no `b` such that \( a + 1 < b \leq r \) and the function conditions are met.

Since the function conditions are only violated when `b` exists in the specified range, and `a` is already at its maximum valid value without violating the conditions, the next `a` will be the same `a + 1` but now it must be checked if it violates the conditions. If it doesn't, then the loop continues.

### New State for the Loop to Execute One More Time:
- `a` will be incremented to `a + 1`.
- The range condition \( l \leq a < r \) must still hold.
- There should not exist an integer `b` such that \( a + 1 < b \leq r \) and the function conditions are met.

Thus, the state adjustments are as follows:

**State:**
- `a` is an integer such that \( l \leq a + 1 < r \).
- There does not exist an integer `b` such that \( a + 2 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`.

So, the final state is:
**State: **`a` is an integer such that \( l \leq a + 1 < r \), and there does not exist an integer `b` such that \( a + 2 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`.**
