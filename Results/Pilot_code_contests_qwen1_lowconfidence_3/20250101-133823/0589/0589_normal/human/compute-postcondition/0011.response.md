Output State: **`a` is an integer such that `l <= a < r` and there exists an integer `b` where `a < b <= r` and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \geq 1\)**.

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `b` starting from `a + 1` up to `r`. It checks the condition `func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a) != 1`.
- If the condition is satisfied, the loop returns `a`, `b`, and `r`.
- If the condition is not satisfied for any `b` in the range, the loop continues until it reaches `r`. In this case, since the loop did not find any valid `b`, it would not return anything, and the variables `a` and `b` would retain their last values before the loop exited without finding a match.
- Therefore, after the loop finishes, `a` is guaranteed to be less than `r` and there must exist some `b` in the range `[a+1, r]` such that the condition is met, or the loop would have returned. If no such `b` exists, `a` and `b` would still be within the range `[l, r)`.

Since the loop can only return once it finds a valid pair `(a, b)` satisfying the condition, the final state of `a` and `b` must satisfy the condition, and `r` remains unchanged.
