Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary states for the loop to execute.

1. **Initial State**: We know that `a` is an integer such that \( l \leq a < r \), and there exists an integer `b` where \( a + 1 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range from `a + 1` to `r` (inclusive).

3. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, the range `a + 1` to `r` must contain at least one element. This means there should be some integer `b` in this range.

4. **Function Calls**: We need to ensure that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1` hold true for at least one `b` in the range `a + 1` to `r`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states such that:

- The variable `a` is within the bounds \( l \leq a < r \).
- There is at least one integer `b` such that \( a + 1 < b \leq r \).
- For this `b`, the function calls `func_5(r, b)` and `func_5(b, a + 1)` return the specified values.

So, the required states are:

- `a` is an integer such that \( l \leq a < r \).
- There exists an integer `b` such that \( a + 1 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`.
- The range `a + 1` to `r` must contain at least one valid `b`.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

**`a` is an integer such that \( l \leq a < r \), and there exists an integer `b` such that \( a + 1 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`, and the range `a + 1` to `r` must contain at least one valid `b`.**

However, since the problem asks for the state to be explicitly listed, we can say:

**`a` is an integer such that \( l \leq a < r \), and there exists an integer `b` such that \( a + 1 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`, and the range `a + 1` to `r` must contain at least one valid `b`**.
