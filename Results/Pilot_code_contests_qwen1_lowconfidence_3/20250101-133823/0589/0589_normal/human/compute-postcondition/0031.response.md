Postcondition: ***`a` is such that \( l \leq a + 1 < r \) and there does not exist an integer `b` such that \( b = b_end + 1 \) and \( b_end + 2 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, b_end + 1) != 1`, and \( a + 1 < r \) and `(func_5(r, b_end + 1) != 1 or func_5(b_end + 1, a) == 1)`, and `b = b_end + 1`, and if `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, no changes are made to `a` and `b`.***

This postcondition summarizes that under the given precondition, if the condition `func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a) != 1` is true, no changes are made to the variables `a` and `b`. Since there is no else part, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as per the precondition.
