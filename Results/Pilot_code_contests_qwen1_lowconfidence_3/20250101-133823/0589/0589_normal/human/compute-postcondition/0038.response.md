The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`. Both `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \leq 50\).

Based on the provided cases, the function can return different sets of values depending on the conditions met. Here are the return values described:

- **Case_1**: Returns `a`, `b`, and `r` where `a` is less than `r`, `b` is such that `func_5(r, b)` equals 1 but `func_5(b, a)` does not equal 1, and `r` is a non-negative integer with \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\).
- **Case_2**: Returns `a`, `b`, and `r` where `a` is less than `r`, `b` is less than `r` and satisfies `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`, and `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \geq 1\).
- **Case_3**: Returns `a`, `b`, and `r` where `a` is less than `r`, `b` is less than `r` and satisfies `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`, and `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \geq 1\).
- **Case_4**: Returns `a`, `b`, and `r` where `a` is an integer within the range \(l \leq a < r\), `b` is an integer such that \(a + 1 < b \leq r\) and satisfies \(func_5(r, b) == 1\) and \(func_5(b, a) != 1\), and `r` is the upper bound of the range.
- **Case_5**: Returns `a`, `b`, and `r` where `b` is set to `a + 2` and the condition that there should not exist an integer `b` such that \(a + 1 < b \leq r\) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1` must still hold true for `b = a + 2`.
- **Case_6**: Returns `a`, `b`, and `r` where `a` remains unchanged, `b` is `a + 3`, and `r` is not specified as it was not altered in the code.
- **Case_7**: Returns `a` such that \(l \leq a + 1 < r\) and there does not exist an integer `b` such that \(a + 2 < b \leq r\) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`, along with `b` and `r` where `b` satisfies the conditions mentioned and `r` is as defined in the initial state.
- **Case_8**: Returns `a` such that \(l \leq a + 1 < r\) and there does not exist an integer `b` such that \(b = b_end + 1\) and \(b_end + 2 < b \leq r\) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, b_end + 1) != 1`, and \(a + 1 < r\) and \((func_5(r, b_end + 1) != 1 or func_5(b_end + 1, a) == 1)\), `b = b_end + 1`, and `r`.
- **Case_9**: Returns `a` that satisfies \(l \leq a + 1 < r\), `b` that is equal to `b_end + 2`, and `r` as given.
- **Case_10**: Returns `-1`, `-1`, `-1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_6` is to accept two parameters `l` and `r`, and return a specific set of values (`a`, `b`, and `r`) based on the conditions provided in the cases.
