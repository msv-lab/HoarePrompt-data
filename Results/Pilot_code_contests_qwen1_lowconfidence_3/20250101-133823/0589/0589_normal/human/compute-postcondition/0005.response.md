Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `l` is a non-negative integer.
   - `r` is a non-negative integer.
   - \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\).
   - \(r - l \geq 1\).
   - `a` is less than `r`.
   - Either `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs over `b` from `a + 1` to `r` (inclusive).

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `b` must be within the range `a + 1` to `r`.

4. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - Let's assume `b` was the value just processed in the previous iteration.

5. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the loop to continue, `b` must be less than `r` and `b` must satisfy the condition `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`.

Given these points, let's determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration:

- `b` needs to be increased by 1 from its current value.
- `b` must still be within the range `a + 1` to `r`.
- `b` must satisfy the condition `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`.

Therefore, the state adjustments are as follows:
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `r` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `b` must be incremented by 1 and must satisfy the condition `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`l` is a non-negative integer, `r` is a non-negative integer, \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\), \(r - l \geq 1\), `a` is less than `r`, `b` is less than `r` and satisfies `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`**
