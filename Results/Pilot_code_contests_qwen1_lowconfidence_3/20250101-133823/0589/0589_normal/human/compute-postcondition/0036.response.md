Output State: **`a` is the largest integer such that `l <= a < r` and there does not exist an integer `b` where `a < b <= r` and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, `b` is the smallest integer greater than `a` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \geq 1\).**
