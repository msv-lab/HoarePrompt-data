To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement.

### Given Conditions:
1. \( l \leq a + 1 < r \)
2. There does not exist an integer `b` such that \( a + 2 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`.
3. \( a + 1 < r \)
4. `(func_5(r, b) != 1 or func_5(b, a) == 1)`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over `b` starting from `a + 1` up to `r`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `b` should satisfy the given conditions.

2. **Current Iteration End:**
   - Let's denote the value of `b` at the end of the previous iteration as `b_end`.

3. **Loop Continuation Condition:**
   - For the loop to continue, `b_end + 1` must be less than or equal to `r` (since the loop increments `b` by 1 each iteration).
   - Additionally, `b_end + 1` should satisfy the given conditions.

4. **Conditions for Next Iteration:**
   - Since `b_end + 1` must be in the range `[a + 1, r)`, we have \( a + 1 \leq b_end + 1 < r \).
   - We need to ensure that there does not exist an integer `b` such that \( b_end + 2 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, b_end + 1) != 1`.
   - Also, we need to ensure `(func_5(r, b_end + 1) != 1 or func_5(b_end + 1, a) == 1)` holds true.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `b` will be `b_end + 1`.
   - Therefore, the new state will have `b` as `b_end + 1` and all other conditions remain the same.

### Conclusion:
The state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `a` remains the same.
- `b` is `b_end + 1`.
- The conditions related to `func_5` and the range `[a + 1, r]` must still hold.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` is such that \( l \leq a + 1 < r \) and there does not exist an integer `b` such that \( b_end + 2 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, b_end + 1) != 1`, and \( a + 1 < r \) and `(func_5(r, b_end + 1) != 1 or func_5(b_end + 1, a) == 1)`, and `b` is `b_end + 1`**
