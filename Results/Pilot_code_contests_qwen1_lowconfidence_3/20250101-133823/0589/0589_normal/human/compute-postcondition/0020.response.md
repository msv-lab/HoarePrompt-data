To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop logic.

### Given Information:
- **At the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `a` remains unchanged.
  - `b` is set to `a + 2`.
  - The condition that there should not exist an integer `b` such that `a + 1 < b ≤ r` and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1` must still hold true for `b = a + 2`.

- **Loop Condition:**
  - The loop iterates over `b` from `a + 1` to `r`.

### Loop Logic:
- The loop checks if `b` satisfies the condition `a + 1 < b ≤ r` and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`.
- If the condition is not met, `b` is set to `a + 2` and the condition must still hold true.
- If the condition is met, the function returns `a, b, r`.

### Current State:
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `b` is `a + 2`.
- The condition for `b = a + 2` must still hold true.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current Value of `b`:**
   - `b = a + 2`.

2. **Check Condition for `b = a + 2`:**
   - We need to check if the condition `a + 1 < (a + 2) ≤ r` and `func_5(r, a + 2) == 1` and `func_5(a + 2, a + 1) != 1` holds true.
   - Simplify the inequality: `a + 1 < a + 2` is always true.
   - Therefore, the condition simplifies to: `func_5(r, a + 2) == 1` and `func_5(a + 2, a + 1) != 1`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to check if the condition for `b = a + 3` holds true.
   - The new value of `b` would be `a + 3`.

4. **Condition for `b = a + 3`:**
   - We need to check if the condition `a + 1 < (a + 3) ≤ r` and `func_5(r, a + 3) == 1` and `func_5(a + 3, a + 1) != 1` holds true.
   - Simplify the inequality: `a + 1 < a + 3` is always true.
   - Therefore, the condition simplifies to: `func_5(r, a + 3) == 1` and `func_5(a + 3, a + 1) != 1`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the condition for `b = a + 3` must hold true.

### Final State:
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `b` is set to `a + 3`.
- The condition that there should not exist an integer `b` such that `a + 1 < b ≤ r` and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1` must still hold true for `b = a + 3`.

**State: **`a` remains unchanged, `b` is set to `a + 3`, and the condition that there should not exist an integer `b` such that `a + 1 < b ≤ r` and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1` must still hold true for `b = a + 3`.**
