Functionality: **The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, where both are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \leq 50\). The function searches for three integers `a`, `b`, and `r` that satisfy certain conditions involving the function `func_5`. Specifically:

- If `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1` for some `a` and `b`, the function returns `a`, `b`, and `r`.
- If no such `a`, `b`, and `r` are found, the function returns `-1`, `-1`, `-1`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `func_5` is already defined and works correctly. If `func_5` is not defined or does not work as expected, the behavior of `func_6` is undefined.
- The function does not handle the case where `l == r`. In this scenario, no valid `a` and `b` can be found since the range `[l, r)` would be empty, leading to a return of `-1`, `-1`, `-1`.
- The function does not provide a detailed description of the conditions under which each case (e.g., Case_1, Case_2, etc.) applies. While the return postconditions are provided, the exact logic for determining which case to apply is not clear from the given annotations.
- The function does not explicitly handle the scenario where `l` and `r` are very close to the upper limit of \(10^{18}\), although this is unlikely due to the constraint \(r - l \leq 50\).

After the function concludes, the return value will be either a tuple `(a, b, r)` where `a` is less than `r`, `b` is greater than `a` and satisfies the conditions related to `func_5`, or a tuple `(-1, -1, -1)` indicating no valid integers were found.**

This summary captures the essential functionality of the function and highlights potential edge cases and missing details from the given annotations.
