Output State: **`a` is such that \( l \leq a + 1 < r \), and there does not exist an integer `b` such that \( b > a + 1 \) and \( b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial Condition**: The loop starts with the condition \( l \leq a + 1 < r \) and there does not exist an integer \( b \) such that \( a + 2 < b \leq r \) and \( \text{func}_5(r, b) == 1 \) and \( \text{func}_5(b, a + 1) != 1 \).
- **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each integer \( b \) starting from \( a + 1 \) up to \( r \). For each \( b \), it checks if \( \text{func}_5(r, b) == 1 \) and \( \text{func}_5(b, a) != 1 \). If both conditions are met, the function returns \( a \), \( b \), and \( r \).
- **Termination Condition**: If the loop does not find any \( b \) that satisfies \( \text{func}_5(r, b) == 1 \) and \( \text{func}_5(b, a) != 1 \) during its iterations, it means that no such \( b \) exists within the range \( a + 1 \) to \( r \). This ensures that the final value of \( a \) remains consistent with the initial condition.

Thus, after the loop finishes executing, \( a \) will still satisfy the condition that there does not exist an integer \( b \) such that \( b > a + 1 \) and \( b \leq r \) and \( \text{func}_5(r, b) == 1 \) and \( \text{func}_5(b, a + 1) != 1 \).

Output State: **`a` is such that \( l \leq a + 1 < r \), and there does not exist an integer `b` such that \( b > a + 1 \) and \( b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`.**
