Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `r` are such that `a` is less than `r`, `b` is less than `r` and satisfies `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`, and `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \geq 1\). Since the else part does not change these conditions, the overall postcondition remains as per the if part.***
