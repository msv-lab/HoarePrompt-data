You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: l and r are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
```
def func_6(l, r):
```
Output: Case_1: `a` is less than `r`, `b` is such that `func_5(r, b)` equals 1 but `func_5(b, a)` does not equal 1, and `r` is a non-negative integer with \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\)

Case_2: The program returns `a`, `b`, and `r` where `a` is less than `r`, `b` is less than `r` and satisfies `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`, and `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \geq 1\)

Case_3: `The program returns a, b, and r where 'a' is less than 'r', 'b' is less than 'r' and satisfies `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`, and 'r' is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \geq 1\)`

Case_4: The program returns integer 'a' within the range \( l \leq a < r \), integer 'b' such that \( a + 1 < b \leq r \) and satisfies \( func_5(r, b) == 1 \) and \( func_5(b, a) != 1 \), and integer 'r' which is the upper bound of the range

Case_5: `The program returns a, b, and r where b is set to a + 2 and the condition that there should not exist an integer b such that a + 1 < b ≤ r and func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a + 1) != 1 must still hold true for b = a + 2`

Case_6: `a` remains unchanged, `b` is `a + 3`, and `r` is not specified as it was not altered in the code

Case_7: The program returns `a` such that \( l \leq a + 1 < r \) and there does not exist an integer `b` such that \( a + 2 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`, and `a + 1 < r`, along with `b` and `r` where `b` satisfies the conditions mentioned and `r` is as defined in the initial state

Case_8: `a` such that \( l \leq a + 1 < r \) and there does not exist an integer `b` such that \( b = b_end + 1 \) and \( b_end + 2 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, b_end + 1) != 1`, and \( a + 1 < r \) and `(func_5(r, b_end + 1) != 1 or func_5(b_end + 1, a) == 1)`, `b = b_end + 1`, `r`

Case_9: a that satisfies \( l \leq a + 1 < r \), b that is equal to b_end + 2, and r as given

Case_10: -1, -1, -1

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
