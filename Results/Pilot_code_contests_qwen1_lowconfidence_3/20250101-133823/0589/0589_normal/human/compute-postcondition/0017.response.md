Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `a` is an integer such that \( l \leq a < r \).
- There does not exist an integer `b` such that \( a + 1 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`.
- The range `a + 1` to `r` does not contain any valid `b`.

### For Loop Statement
```
for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop iterates over integers `b` starting from `a + 1` up to `r`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `b` must be within the range `a + 1` to `r`.

2. **Check the Initial Conditions:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` was the highest value in the range `a + 1` to `r` that satisfied the given conditions.
   - Since `b` must be within the range `a + 1` to `r` for the loop to continue, the next possible value for `b` would be `a + 2`.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - `a` remains unchanged since the loop is iterating over `b` in the range starting from `a + 1`.
   - `b` needs to be set to the next value in the range, which is `a + 2`.
   - The condition that there should not exist an integer `b` such that \( a + 1 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1` must still hold true for `b = a + 2`.

### Final State
State: **`a` is an integer such that \( l \leq a < r \), `b` is \( a + 2 \), and there does not exist an integer `b` such that \( a + 1 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`. Additionally, the range `a + 3` to `r` does not contain any valid `b`.**
