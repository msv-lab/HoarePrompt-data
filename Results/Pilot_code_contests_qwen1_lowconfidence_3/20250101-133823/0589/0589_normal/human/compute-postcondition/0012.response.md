Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a` is an integer such that \( l \leq a < r \).
- There exists an integer `b` where \( a < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`.
- `r` is a non-negative integer such that \( 1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18} \) and \( r - l \geq 1 \).

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for a in range(l, r + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Current Value of `a`:**
   - The current value of `a` is the last value processed in the previous iteration.
   - Since \( l \leq a < r \), `a` must satisfy this condition.

2. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, the next value of `a` should be \( a + 1 \).
   - This new value \( a + 1 \) must still satisfy \( l \leq a + 1 \leq r \).
   - Therefore, the new value of `a` will be \( a + 1 \), ensuring \( l \leq a + 1 < r \).

3. **Existence of `b`:**
   - There must exist an integer `b` such that \( a + 1 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`.
   - Since `b` was valid for the previous `a`, we can use the same `b` if it still satisfies the conditions for \( a + 1 \).

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `a` will now be \( a + 1 \).
- The condition \( l \leq a < r \) must still hold.
- The existence of `b` needs to be re-evaluated for the new `a`.

### Updated State:
- `a` is an integer such that \( l \leq a < r \) (now \( a + 1 \)).
- There exists an integer `b` where \( a + 1 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is an integer such that \( l \leq a < r \) and there exists an integer `b` where \( a + 1 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`**
