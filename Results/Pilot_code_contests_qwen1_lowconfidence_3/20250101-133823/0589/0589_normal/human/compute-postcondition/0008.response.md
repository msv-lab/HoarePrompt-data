Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a` is less than `r`.
- `b` is less than `r` and satisfies `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`.
- `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \geq 1\).

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions**: The loop starts with `b = a + 1` and increments `b` by 1 in each iteration until `b` reaches `r`.

2. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` remains unchanged from the start.
   - `b` is one value less than its value at the start of the current iteration (let's call it `b_start`).
   - `r` remains unchanged from the start.

3. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `b` must be less than `r`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `b` should be `b_start + 1` and should still satisfy the condition `b < r`.
   - Additionally, `b` must satisfy either `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`.

4. **Updated State**:
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `b` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, so `b` is now `b_start + 1`.
   - `r` remains unchanged.
   - The condition `b < r` must hold true for the next iteration.
   - The condition `b < r` and `b` satisfying either `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1` must also hold true.

### Final Adjusted State:

State: **`a` is less than `r`, `b` is less than `r` and satisfies `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`, and `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \geq 1\)**, where `b` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

In more explicit terms:
- `a` is unchanged.
- `b` is now `b_start + 1`.
- `r` remains unchanged.

So, the final state can be summarized as:

State: **`a` is less than `r`, `b` is less than `r` and satisfies `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`, and `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \geq 1\)**, and `b` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

However, to match the required format strictly:

State: **`a` is less than `r`, `b` is less than `r` and satisfies `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`, and `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \geq 1\)**, and `b` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
