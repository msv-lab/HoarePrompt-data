Output State: **`a` is an integer such that \( l \leq a < r \), and there does not exist an integer `b` such that \( a + 1 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`. If the loop executes, the function returns `a, b, r` where `b` is the smallest integer greater than `a` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`. If no such `b` exists within the range, the function eventually returns `a, b, r` with `b` being `r` itself.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `a` is in the range \( l \leq a < r \).
- There exists an integer `b` such that \( a + 1 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`.
- The loop iterates over `b` from `a + 1` to `r` and checks the conditions `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`.
- If the conditions are met for some `b`, the function returns `a, b, r`.
- If no such `b` is found during the loop, the loop will eventually check the last possible `b`, which is `r`, and return `a, r, r`.

Thus, after the loop completes, either `b` is the smallest integer greater than `a` satisfying the conditions, or `b` is `r` if no such integer exists in the range.
