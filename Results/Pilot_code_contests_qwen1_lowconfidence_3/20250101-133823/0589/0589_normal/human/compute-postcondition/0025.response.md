Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The variable `a` is such that \( l \leq a + 1 < r \). This means that `a` is within a specific range, specifically between \( l - 1 \) and \( r - 1 \).

2. **Condition to Ensure Loop Execution**: The loop will iterate over values of `b` starting from `a + 1` up to `r`. For the loop to execute, the condition \( a + 1 < r \) must hold true. Additionally, the loop should not encounter a value `b` such that \( a + 2 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` while `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`.

3. **Loop Execution Context**: 
   - The loop will start with `b = a + 1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `b` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - For each value of `b`, the conditions involving `func_5` need to be checked.

4. **Ensuring Loop Initialization and Conditions**:
   - To ensure the loop starts, `a + 1` must be less than `r`.
   - We need to ensure that no value of `b` violates the condition `a + 2 < b \leq r` and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`.

Given these points, let's summarize the required adjustments:

- `a` must satisfy \( l \leq a + 1 < r \).
- There must not exist any `b` such that \( a + 2 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`.

Since we need to ensure the loop starts and continues correctly without violating the specified conditions, the final state should include:

State: **`a` is such that \( l \leq a + 1 < r \) and there does not exist an integer `b` such that \( a + 2 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`, and `a + 1 < r`**.
