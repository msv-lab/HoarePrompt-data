Postcondition: ***`a` is such that \( l \leq a + 1 < r \) and there does not exist an integer `b` such that \( a + 2 < b \leq r \) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1\), and `a + 1 < r`. Additionally, the function `func_5(r, b)` evaluates to 1 and `func_5(b, a + 1)` does not evaluate to 1 for some integer `b` such that \( a + 1 \leq b < r \).***
