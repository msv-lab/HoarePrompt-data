You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_6(l, r):
    for a in range(l, r + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
            if func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a) != 1:
                return a, b, r
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is the largest integer such that `l <= a < r` and there does not exist an integer `b` where `a < b <= r` and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, `b` is the smallest integer greater than `a` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \geq 1\).
    return -1, -1, -1
    #-1, -1, -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`. Both `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \leq 50\).
#
#Based on the provided cases, the function can return different sets of values depending on the conditions met. Here are the return values described:
#
#- **Case_1**: Returns `a`, `b`, and `r` where `a` is less than `r`, `b` is such that `func_5(r, b)` equals 1 but `func_5(b, a)` does not equal 1, and `r` is a non-negative integer with \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\).
#- **Case_2**: Returns `a`, `b`, and `r` where `a` is less than `r`, `b` is less than `r` and satisfies `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`, and `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \geq 1\).
#- **Case_3**: Returns `a`, `b`, and `r` where `a` is less than `r`, `b` is less than `r` and satisfies `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`, and `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \geq 1\).
#- **Case_4**: Returns `a`, `b`, and `r` where `a` is an integer within the range \(l \leq a < r\), `b` is an integer such that \(a + 1 < b \leq r\) and satisfies \(func_5(r, b) == 1\) and \(func_5(b, a) != 1\), and `r` is the upper bound of the range.
#- **Case_5**: Returns `a`, `b`, and `r` where `b` is set to `a + 2` and the condition that there should not exist an integer `b` such that \(a + 1 < b \leq r\) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1` must still hold true for `b = a + 2`.
#- **Case_6**: Returns `a`, `b`, and `r` where `a` remains unchanged, `b` is `a + 3`, and `r` is not specified as it was not altered in the code.
#- **Case_7**: Returns `a` such that \(l \leq a + 1 < r\) and there does not exist an integer `b` such that \(a + 2 < b \leq r\) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a + 1) != 1`, along with `b` and `r` where `b` satisfies the conditions mentioned and `r` is as defined in the initial state.
#- **Case_8**: Returns `a` such that \(l \leq a + 1 < r\) and there does not exist an integer `b` such that \(b = b_end + 1\) and \(b_end + 2 < b \leq r\) and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, b_end + 1) != 1`, and \(a + 1 < r\) and \((func_5(r, b_end + 1) != 1 or func_5(b_end + 1, a) == 1)\), `b = b_end + 1`, and `r`.
#- **Case_9**: Returns `a` that satisfies \(l \leq a + 1 < r\), `b` that is equal to `b_end + 2`, and `r` as given.
#- **Case_10**: Returns `-1`, `-1`, `-1`.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_6` is to accept two parameters `l` and `r`, and return a specific set of values (`a`, `b`, and `r`) based on the conditions provided in the cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
