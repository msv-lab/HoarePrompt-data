The function reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input and returns a map object containing these integers. The function expects the input to consist of integers separated by spaces. If the input does not meet this requirement (e.g., contains non-integer values or is not separated by spaces), the function will still attempt to convert the input but may result in a `ValueError`. There is no validation to ensure that the input strictly follows the specified constraints (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50).
