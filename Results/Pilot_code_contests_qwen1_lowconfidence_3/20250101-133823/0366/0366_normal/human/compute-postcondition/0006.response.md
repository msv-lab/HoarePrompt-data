The code appends a new element `[u, c]` to the list `e[v]`. Given that `u` is `u - 1` and `v` is the input integer minus 1, these variables will be used in the append operation.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive
- `m` is at least 1
- `i` is 0
- `e` is a list of adjacency lists where `e[u]` now includes `[v, c]`
- `vis` is a boolean list of length `n`
- `mod` is 1,000,000,007
- `u` is `u - 1`
- `v` is the input integer minus 1
- `c` is the input integer

After executing the code, `e[v]` will include the additional element `[u, c]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive; `m` is at least 1; `i` is 0; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n`; `mod` is 1,000,000,007; `u` is `u - 1`; `v` is the input integer minus 1; `c` is the input integer; `e[v]` includes the element `[u, c]`**
