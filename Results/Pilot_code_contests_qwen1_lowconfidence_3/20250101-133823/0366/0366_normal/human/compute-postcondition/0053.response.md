The code `ans *= 2` multiplies the current value of `ans` by 2. Given that the initial value of `ans` is 2, the new value of `ans` will be \(2 \times 2 = 4\). All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is the total number of edges added and satisfies `1 <= m < n+1`, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` where exactly `m` elements are set to `True`, `mod` is 1,000,000,007, `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1, `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge, `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added by the loop, `cnt` is 3, `ans` is 4**
