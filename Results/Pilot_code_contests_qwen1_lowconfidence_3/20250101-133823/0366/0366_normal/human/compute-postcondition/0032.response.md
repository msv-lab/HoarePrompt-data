The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `cnt` is `1` (since it was initially `0`), and the rest of the variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is less than `n`, `i` is `m`, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` with `vis[m]` set to `True`, `mod` is 1,000,000,007, `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1, `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge, `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added so far, `cnt` is 1, `vis[m]` is `True`**
