The code `print(ans)` does not affect the value of any variables. It simply prints the value of `ans`. Since there is no assignment or modification to `ans` before this line, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`ans` retains its original value**
