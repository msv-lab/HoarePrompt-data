You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 100 000. e is a list of adjacency lists where e[i] contains pairs [v, c] for each vertex v connected to vertex i with a relationship described by c (c is 1 if they love each other and 0 if they hate each other). vis is a boolean list of length n indicating whether each character has been visited during the graph traversal. mod is an integer representing the modulo value (1 000 000 007).
def func_2():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, c = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        e[u].append([v, c])
        
        e[v].append([u, c])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive; `m` is the total number of edges added; `i` is `m-1`; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n`; `mod` is 1,000,000,007; `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1; `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge; `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added by the loop.
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if vis[i] == False:
            vis[i] = True
            cnt += 1
            if func_1(i) == False:
                cnt = 0
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive; `m` is the total number of edges added and satisfies `1 <= m < n+1`; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` where exactly `m` elements are set to `True`; `mod` is 1,000,000,007; `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1; `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge; `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added by the loop; `cnt` is 0. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `cnt` will be 0, meaning no node was found to violate the condition in `func_1(i)` during any iteration. If the loop breaks, `cnt` will be 0 and exactly `m` nodes were visited.
    ans = 1
    if (cnt == 0) :
        ans = 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive; `m` is the total number of edges added and satisfies `1 <= m < n+1`; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` where exactly `m` elements are set to `True`; `mod` is 1,000,000,007; `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1; `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge; `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added by the loop; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is 1, as it starts from 1 and is not modified in the if part since `cnt == 0`.
    for i in (1, cnt):
        ans *= 2
        
        ans %= mod
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State:
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `e`, `vis`, and `mod` and performs operations based on these parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
