Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is less than `n`, `i` is `m`, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` with `vis[m]` set to `True`, `mod` is 1,000,000,007, `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1, `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge, `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added so far, `cnt` is 0, `vis[m]` is `True`***

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided, we assume that the execution falls into the if part. The postcondition of the if part directly becomes the overall postcondition of the if-else block. The `total` remains 0, and other variables retain their states as described in the if part's postcondition.
