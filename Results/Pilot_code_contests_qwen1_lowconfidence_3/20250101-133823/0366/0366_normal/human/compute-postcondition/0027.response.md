The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most nested block it is inside. In this case, the `break` statement is outside any explicit loops in the given code snippet, which means it will simply terminate the execution of whatever block it is within, such as an implicit loop from a function call or a conditional block. However, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, we assume it is outside any such structure, meaning the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is the total number of edges added and must satisfy `1 <= m < n+1`, `i` is `m-1`, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` with `vis[i]` set to `True`, `mod` is 1,000,000,007, `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1, `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge, `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added by the loop, `cnt` is 0, and the function `func_1(i)` returns `False`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.**
