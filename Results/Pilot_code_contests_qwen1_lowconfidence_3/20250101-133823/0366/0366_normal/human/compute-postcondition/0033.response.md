`cnt` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `cnt` was previously `1`, so it is updated to `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is less than `n`, `i` is `m`, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` with `vis[m]` set to `True`, `mod` is 1,000,000,007, `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1, `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge, `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added so far, `cnt` is 0, `vis[m]` is `True`**
