`e[u]` is updated by appending `[v, c]` to the list at index `u`. Since `u` is an integer and is decreased by 1, and `v` is an integer and is decreased by 1, their new values are `u-1` and `v-1`, respectively. The value of `c` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `u` is an integer and is decreased by 1; `v` is an integer and is decreased by 1; `c` is an integer; `e[u-1].append([v-1, c])`.

Output State: **`u` is an integer and is decreased by 1; `v` is an integer and is decreased by 1; `c` is an integer; `e[u-1].append([v-1, c])`**
