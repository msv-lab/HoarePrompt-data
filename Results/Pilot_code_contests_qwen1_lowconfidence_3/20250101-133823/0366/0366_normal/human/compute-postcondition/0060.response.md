The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters:
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\).
- `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 100{,}000\).
- `e` is a list of adjacency lists, where `e[i]` contains pairs `[v, c]` for each vertex `v` connected to vertex `i` with a relationship described by `c` (where `c` is 1 if they love each other and 0 if they hate each other).
- `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` indicating whether each character has been visited during the graph traversal.
- `mod` is an integer representing the modulo value (1{,}000{,}000{,}007).

The function returns a value based on the given conditions but the specific return type or value is not explicitly stated in the provided information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, `e`, `vis`, and `mod` and perform some operations based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `e`, `vis`, and `mod` and performs operations based on these parameters.**
