The code reads three integers `u`, `v`, and `c` from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `c` respectively. This changes the values of `u`, `v`, and `c`. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `e`, and `vis` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with a value between 3 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `e` is a list of adjacency lists, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n`, `mod` is 1,000,000,007, `u` is an integer read from input, `v` is an integer read from input, `c` is an integer read from input**
