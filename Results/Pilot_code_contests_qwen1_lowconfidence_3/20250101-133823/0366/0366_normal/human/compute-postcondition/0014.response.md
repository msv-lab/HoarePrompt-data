The code `u, v, c = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `c`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for these variables, we only know that they are now integers. The original values of `u`, `v`, and `c` are replaced by the integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `c` is an integer**
