The code appends a list `[v, c]` to the adjacency list `e[u]`. Given the initial state, the following changes occur:

- `u` is decremented by 1.
- `v` is an integer read from input and then decremented by 1.
- `c` is an integer read from input.

The adjacency list `e[u]` is updated to include the list `[v, c]`.

Other variables remain unchanged in their values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `e` is a list of adjacency lists where `e[u]` now includes `[v, c]`, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n`, `mod` is 1,000,000,007, `u` is `u - 1`, `v` is the input integer minus 1, `c` is the input integer.**
