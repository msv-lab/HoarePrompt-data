`v` is decremented by 1. The value of `v` was initially an integer read from input, and now it is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer with a value between 3 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `e` is a list of adjacency lists, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n`, `mod` is 1,000,000,007, `u` is one less than its initial value, `v` is an integer read from input and decreased by 1, `c` is an integer read from input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with a value between 3 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `e` is a list of adjacency lists, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n`, `mod` is 1,000,000,007, `u` is one less than its initial value, `v` is an integer read from input and decreased by 1, `c` is an integer read from input**
