Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive; `m` is the total number of edges added; `i` is `m-1`; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n`; `mod` is 1,000,000,007; `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1; `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge; `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added by the loop.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 0 and 100,000 inclusive, and `e` is a list of adjacency lists. The `vis` list is a boolean list of length `n`, and `mod` is set to 1,000,000,007.
2. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs `m` times, where `m` is the number of edges to be added. During each iteration, it reads three integers `u`, `v`, and `c` from the input, decreases them by 1 (`u -= 1` and `v -= 1`), and appends the pair `[v, c]` to `e[u]` and the pair `[u, c]` to `e[v]`.
3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `m` will be the total number of edges added to the graph.
   - The variable `i` will be `m-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its execution.
   - The adjacency list `e` will contain all the edges added by the loop. Each node `u` will have an adjacency list `e[u]` containing pairs `[v, c]` where `v` and `c` are the node and cost of the edge, respectively.
   - All other variables remain consistent with their initial conditions or the last update during the loop's execution.

This output state captures the final configuration of the graph and the variables after the loop completes its execution.
