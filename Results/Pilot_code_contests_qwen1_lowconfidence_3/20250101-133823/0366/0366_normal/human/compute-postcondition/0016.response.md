`v` is decremented by 1. The value of `u` is an integer and is decreased by 1, which means `u` is now one less than its original value. The value of `c` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is an integer and is decreased by 1; `v` is an integer and is decreased by 1; `c` is an integer.

Output State: **`u` is an integer and is decreased by 1; `v` is an integer and is decreased by 1; `c` is an integer**
