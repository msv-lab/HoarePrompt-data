The line `cnt = 0` sets the value of `cnt` to 0. This changes the value of `cnt` from 1 to 0. All other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`total` is 0; `n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive; `m` is less than `n`; `i` is `m + 1`; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` with `vis[m]` set to `True` and `vis[i]` set to `True`; `mod` is 1,000,000,007; `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1; `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge; `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added so far; `cnt` is 0**
