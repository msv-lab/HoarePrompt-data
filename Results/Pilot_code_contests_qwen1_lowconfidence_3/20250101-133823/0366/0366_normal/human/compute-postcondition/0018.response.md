First, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet:

- Initial State: `u` is an integer and is decreased by 1; `v` is an integer and is decreased by 1; `c` is an integer; `e[u-1].append([v-1, c])`
  - This means `u` and `v` are both integers that have been decreased by 1, so `u` is originally `u0 + 1` and `v` is originally `v0 + 1` (where `u0` and `v0` are the original values).
  - `c` is an integer.
  - `e` is a list where `e[u-1]` (which is `e[u0]`) contains an appended list `[v-1, c]` (which is `[v0, c]`).

Now, let's look at the code snippet:
```
e[v].append([u, c])
```
- This line appends a new list `[u, c]` to the list `e[v]`.
- Since `v` was originally `v0 + 1`, `e[v]` (which is `e[v0+1]`) did not exist before this line. After executing this line, `e[v0+1]` now contains `[u, c]`.

Let's summarize the changes:
- `u` and `v` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- `c` remains unchanged from its initial state.
- `e[u0]` (which was `e[u-1]` in the initial state) now contains `[v0, c]`.
- `e[v0+1]` (which did not exist initially) now contains `[u, c]`.

Output State: **`u` is an integer and is decreased by 1; `v` is an integer and is decreased by 1; `c` is an integer; `e[u0]` is `[v0, c]`; `e[v0+1]` is `[u, c]`**
