`u` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `u` was an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive. After decrementing, `u` will be one less than its initial value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with a value between 3 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `e` is a list of adjacency lists, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n`, `mod` is 1,000,000,007, `u` is one less than its initial value, `v` is an integer read from input, `c` is an integer read from input**
