The code `ans = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive; `m` is the total number of edges added and satisfies `1 <= m < n+1`; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` where exactly `m` elements are set to `True`; `mod` is 1,000,000,007; `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1; `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge; `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added by the loop; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is 0.
