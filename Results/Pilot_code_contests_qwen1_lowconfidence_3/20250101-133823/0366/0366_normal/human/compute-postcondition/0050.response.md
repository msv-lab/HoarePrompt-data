`ans` is multiplied by 2. The value of `ans` was initially 1, so after this operation, `ans` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is the total number of edges added and satisfies `1 <= m < n+1`, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` where exactly `m` elements are set to `True`, `mod` is 1,000,000,007, `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1, `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge, `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added by the loop, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is 2**
