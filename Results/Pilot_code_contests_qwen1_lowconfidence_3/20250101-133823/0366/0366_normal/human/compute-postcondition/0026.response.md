The code `cnt = 0` sets the variable `cnt` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is the total number of edges added and must satisfy `1 <= m < n+1`, `i` is `m-1`, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` with `vis[i]` set to `True`, `mod` is 1,000,000,007, `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1, `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge, `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added by the loop, `cnt` is 0, and the function `func_1(i)` returns `False`.**
