The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only causes the exit from the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. Since no loop or conditional statement is specified in the given code, the only effect is that the program exits the current context, which could be a loop or an if-else statement. However, since no such structure is present in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is less than `n`, `i` is `m`, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` with `vis[m]` set to `True`, `mod` is 1,000,000,007, `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1, `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge, `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added so far, `cnt` is 0, `vis[m]` is `True`**
