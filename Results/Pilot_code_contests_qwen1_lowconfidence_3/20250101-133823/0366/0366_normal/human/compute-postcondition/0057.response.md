The code `ans %= mod` takes the current value of `ans` and applies the modulus operation with `mod` (which is 1,000,000,007). The value of `ans` is updated to be the remainder when `ans` is divided by `mod`. Given the initial value of `ans` is 8, the updated value of `ans` after applying the modulus operation will be 8 because 8 is less than 1,000,000,007.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is the total number of edges added and satisfies `1 <= m < n+1`, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` where exactly `m` elements are set to `True`, `mod` is 1,000,000,007, `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1, `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge, `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added by the loop, `cnt` is 3, `ans` is 8** (after applying `ans %= mod`).
