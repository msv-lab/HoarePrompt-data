The variable `cnt` is assigned the value `0`. No other variables are affected. The initial values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `vis`, `mod`, `u`, `v`, `c`, `e[u]`, and `e[v]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive; `m` is the total number of edges added; `i` is `m-1`; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n`; `mod` is 1,000,000,007; `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1; `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge; `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added by the loop; `cnt` is 0.**
