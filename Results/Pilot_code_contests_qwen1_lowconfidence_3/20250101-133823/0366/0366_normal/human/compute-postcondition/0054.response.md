The code snippet performs a modulus operation on the variable `ans` with `mod`. Given the initial state, `ans` is 4 and `mod` is 1,000,000,007. The modulus operation `ans %= mod` ensures that `ans` is within the range `[0, mod-1]`. Since `ans` is already less than `mod`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is the total number of edges added and satisfies `1 <= m < n+1`, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` where exactly `m` elements are set to `True`, `mod` is 1,000,000,007, `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1, `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge, `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added by the loop, `cnt` is 3, `ans` is 4.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is the total number of edges added and satisfies `1 <= m < n+1`, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` where exactly `m` elements are set to `True`, `mod` is 1,000,000,007, `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1, `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge, `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added by the loop, `cnt` is 3, `ans` is 4**
