Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive; `m` is the total number of edges added and satisfies `1 <= m < n+1`; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` where exactly `m` elements are set to `True`; `mod` is 1,000,000,007; `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1; `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge; `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added by the loop; `cnt` is 0. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `cnt` will be 0, meaning no node was found to violate the condition in `func_1(i)` during any iteration. If the loop breaks, `cnt` will be 0 and exactly `m` nodes were visited.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`:** These variables are given as inputs and remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`vis`:** This list is initially all `False`. As the loop iterates through each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, if `vis[i]` is `False`, it is set to `True`. After all iterations, exactly `m` elements in `vis` will be `True`, indicating the nodes that were visited.
- **`mod`:** This variable remains constant at `1,000,000,007`.
- **`u` and `v`:** These variables represent the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1. They are updated within the loop for each edge added.
- **`c`:** This variable represents the cost of the edge and is updated for each edge added.
- **`e[u]` and `e[v]`:** These are adjacency lists that store the edges added by the loop. They will contain all the edges added so far.
- **`cnt`:** This counter starts at `0` and increments only when `func_1(i)` returns `False`. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `cnt` will remain `0`. If the loop breaks, `cnt` will also be `0`, but this indicates that the loop did not find a node violating the condition in `func_1(i)` during any iteration.

Since the loop iterates over all possible indices `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and each `i` is processed at most once (either setting `vis[i]` to `True` or breaking the loop if `func_1(i)` returns `False`), the final state of the variables reflects the full processing of all potential nodes up to the point where the loop terminates.
