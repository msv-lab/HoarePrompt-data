`u` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `u` is the first integer input minus 1. After decrementing, the new value of `u` is the first integer input minus 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n`, `mod` is 1,000,000,007, `u` is the first integer input minus 2, `v` is the second integer input minus 1, `c` is the third integer input**
