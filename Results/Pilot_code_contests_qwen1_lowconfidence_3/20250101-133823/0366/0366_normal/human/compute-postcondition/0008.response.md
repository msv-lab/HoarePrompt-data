The code `u, v, c = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads three integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `u`, `v`, and `c`. Since the input is split into integers, `u`, `v`, and `c` will be assigned the respective integer values from the input. The variables `n`, `m`, `i`, `vis`, `mod`, `u`, `v`, and `c` are updated. 

The state of `n`, `m`, `i`, `vis`, and `mod` remains unchanged. The variables `u`, `v`, and `c` are updated to the integer values from the input. The variable `v` is adjusted by subtracting 1 and `c` is the original input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n`, `mod` is 1,000,000,007, `u` is the first integer input minus 1, `v` is the second integer input minus 1, `c` is the third integer input**
