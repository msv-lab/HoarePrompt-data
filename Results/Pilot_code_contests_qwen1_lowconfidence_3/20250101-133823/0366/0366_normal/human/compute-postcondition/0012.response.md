The code appends a list `[u, c]` to the existing list `e[v]`. The values of `u` and `v` are given as `u = first integer input - 2` and `v = second integer input - 2`, and `c` is the third integer input. 

Let's denote the first integer input as `first_input`, the second integer input as `second_input`, and the third integer input as `third_input`.

Given:
- `u = first_input - 2`
- `v = second_input - 2`
- `c = third_input`

Initially, `e[v]` is a list that contains elements from the original list plus `[v, c]`. After the code runs, this list will have an additional element `[u, c]` appended to it.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n`, `mod` is 1,000,000,007, `u` is `first_input - 2`, `v` is `second_input - 2`, `c` is `third_input`, `e[v]` is a list containing elements from the original list plus `[v, c, [u, c]]`**.
