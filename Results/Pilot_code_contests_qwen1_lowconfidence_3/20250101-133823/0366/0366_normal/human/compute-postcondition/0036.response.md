Postcondition: ***`total` remains 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is less than `n`, `i` is `m`, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` with `vis[m]` set to `True`, `mod` is 1,000,000,007, `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1, `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge, `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added so far, `cnt` is 0. Since the condition `vis[i] == False` is not met (as `vis[m]` is set to `True`), the if part does not execute and the else part also does not exist, hence the state of the program remains unchanged.***
