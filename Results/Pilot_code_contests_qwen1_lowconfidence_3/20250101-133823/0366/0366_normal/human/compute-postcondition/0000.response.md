The code reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the input using `raw_input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. These values are then assigned to the variables `n` and `m`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with a value between 3 and 100 000 inclusive, `m` is an integer with a value between 0 and 100 000 inclusive, `e` is a list of adjacency lists, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n`, `mod` is 1 000 000 007.**
