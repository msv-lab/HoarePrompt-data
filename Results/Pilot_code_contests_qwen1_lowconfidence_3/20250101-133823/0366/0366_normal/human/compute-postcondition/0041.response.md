The `break` statement does not change any variable values; it only exits the loop or the most internal conditional block it is within. Since no loop or conditional block was specified in the code snippet, we assume it is breaking out of an implicit loop or conditional context from the initial state. 

The initial state includes the following:
- `total` is 0
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive
- `m` is less than `n`
- `i` is `m + 1`
- `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` with `vis[m]` set to `True` and `vis[i]` set to `True`
- `mod` is 1,000,000,007
- `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1
- `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge
- `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added so far
- `cnt` is 0

Since there is no explicit loop or conditional structure that is exited, the values of all variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is 0; `n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive; `m` is less than `n`; `i` is `m + 1`; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` with `vis[m]` set to `True` and `vis[i]` set to `True`; `mod` is 1,000,000,007; `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1; `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge; `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added so far; `cnt` is 0**
