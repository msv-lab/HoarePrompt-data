n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 100 000. e is a list of adjacency lists where e[i] contains pairs [v, c] for each vertex v connected to vertex i with a relationship described by c (c is 1 if they love each other and 0 if they hate each other). vis is a boolean list of length n indicating whether each character has been visited during the graph traversal. mod is an integer representing the modulo value (1 000 000 007).
