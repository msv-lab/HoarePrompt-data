Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code does not handle the case where the graph cannot be partitioned such that every triangle satisfies the given conditions. The function `func_1` checks if the graph can be consistently labeled according to the given relationships, but it does not ensure that the labeling results in the desired outcome (exactly one pair in love or all pairs in love in every triangle). 

For example, consider the following input:

```
4 4
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 0
4 1 0
```

This input describes a situation where 1 and 2 love each other, 2 and 3 love each other, 3 and 4 hate each other, and 4 and 1 hate each other. According to the problem description, the only valid configuration is to make 1 and 3 love each other and 2 and 4 hate each other. However, the provided code does not enforce this constraint, leading to an incorrect output. Therefore, the code is not correct for every potential case.
