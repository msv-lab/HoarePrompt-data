Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the program attempts to solve the problem using a depth-first search (DFS) approach to assign love/hate statuses to ensure that every triangle is either a single love or all loves, but it contains several issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of DFS**: The `func_1` function is designed to check if the graph can be colored such that every triangle is either all loves or exactly one love. However, the implementation of `func_1` does not correctly handle all cases, especially when multiple components exist in the graph. It only checks one component at a time, and if that component fails, it breaks without properly handling the rest of the graph.

2. **Missing Handling of Multiple Components**: The program does not account for the possibility of the graph being disconnected. In such cases, it should handle each connected component separately, but the current implementation only processes one component.

3. **Incorrect Modulo Operation**: The program initializes `ans` to 1 and multiplies by 2 for each component, but it should consider the number of ways to color the remaining edges modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The current implementation does not correctly compute the number of valid ways to color the remaining edges.

4. **Lack of Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases such as graphs with no edges or graphs where the initial conditions already violate the required constraints.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails, consider the following input:

```
4 4
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 0
4 1 0
```

The expected output is `1`, as the only valid way to satisfy the conditions is to make 1 and 3 love each other and 2 and 4 hate each other. However, the provided program does not handle this case correctly due to the issues mentioned above. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
