You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are many anime that are about "love triangles": Alice loves Bob, and Charlie loves Bob as well, but Alice hates Charlie. You are thinking about an anime which has n characters. The characters are labeled from 1 to n. Every pair of two characters can either mutually love each other or mutually hate each other (there is no neutral state).

You hate love triangles (A-B are in love and B-C are in love, but A-C hate each other), and you also hate it when nobody is in love. So, considering any three characters, you will be happy if exactly one pair is in love (A and B love each other, and C hates both A and B), or if all three pairs are in love (A loves B, B loves C, C loves A).

You are given a list of m known relationships in the anime. You know for sure that certain pairs love each other, and certain pairs hate each other. You're wondering how many ways you can fill in the remaining relationships so you are happy with every triangle. Two ways are considered different if two characters are in love in one way but hate each other in the other. Print this count modulo 1 000 000 007.

Input

The first line of input will contain two integers n, m (3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 100 000).

The next m lines will contain the description of the known relationships. The i-th line will contain three integers ai, bi, ci. If ci is 1, then ai and bi are in love, otherwise, they hate each other (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, <image>).

Each pair of people will be described no more than once.

Output

Print a single integer equal to the number of ways to fill in the remaining pairs so that you are happy with every triangle modulo 1 000 000 007.

Note

In the first sample, the four ways are to: 

  * Make everyone love each other 
  * Make 1 and 2 love each other, and 3 hate 1 and 2 (symmetrically, we get 3 ways from this). 



In the second sample, the only possible solution is to make 1 and 3 love each other and 2 and 4 hate each other.

def func_1(u):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `u` is an integer in the range [1, n], `e` is a list of adjacency lists, `vis` is a list of booleans or integers, `sz` is the length of the list `e[u]`, `ok` is the final return value of `func_1(v)` after all iterations of the loop, `v` is a character label in the range [1, n], and `c` is a boolean indicating whether `u` and `v` love each other (True) or hate each other (False). If the loop executes, `vis[v]` is set to `vis[u]` if `c` is True, and to `-vis[u]` if `c` is False, ensuring that for any two connected nodes, `vis[v]` is either the same as `vis[u]` if they love each other or the negation of `vis[u]` if they hate each other. If the loop does not execute (when `sz` is 0), `vis` remains as its initial state, which is False for all elements.
    return ok
    #The program returns `ok`, which is the final return value of `func_1(v)` after all iterations of the loop, considering the values of `vis[v]` based on whether `u` and `v` love or hate each other
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `u`, a list of adjacency lists `e`, and a list `vis`. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the graph represented by `e`, updating the `vis` list based on the relationship (love or hate) between `u` and each of its neighbors. For each neighbor `v`, if `vis[v]` is not yet set, `vis[v]` is updated to `vis[u]` if `u` and `v` love each other (`c == True`), or to `-vis[u]` if they hate each other (`c == False`). The function recursively calls itself for each neighbor. If at any point the relationships violate the conditions (either loving characters have different signs in `vis` or hating characters have the same sign), the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `ok`, which is the final return value of the recursive calls, ensuring that the `vis` list maintains the required relationship signs for all connected components. The function can only return `True` (or `ok` being `True`) if the entire graph can be consistently labeled according to the given relationships without violating any conditions.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 100 000. e is a list of adjacency lists where e[i] contains pairs [v, c] for each vertex v connected to vertex i with a relationship described by c (c is 1 if they love each other and 0 if they hate each other). vis is a boolean list of length n indicating whether each character has been visited during the graph traversal. mod is an integer representing the modulo value (1 000 000 007).

If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `cnt` will be 0, meaning no node was found to violate the condition in `func_1(i)` during any iteration. If the loop breaks, `cnt` will be 0 and exactly `m` nodes were visited.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a graph represented by adjacency lists `e` and determines if the graph can be split into disjoint sets such that each set is connected internally and the relationship between any two nodes within a set is "love" (denoted by `c=1`). It performs a depth-first search (DFS) to visit all nodes, ensuring no node violates the "love" condition within its set. If any node violates the condition, the function sets `cnt` to 0 and exits early. If no node violates the condition, it calculates the number of ways to partition the graph into such sets using bitwise operations and returns the result modulo \(1,000,000,007\). If no valid partitioning is possible, it returns 0.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
