Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the number of ways to fill in the remaining relationships such that the given conditions are satisfied. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using adjacency lists (`e`), which is a standard and efficient way to store the relationships between characters.
2. **DFS Traversal**: The `func_1` function performs a DFS traversal to ensure that for any three characters \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\), either exactly one pair is in love (and the third pair hates each other) or all three pairs are in love. This is done by maintaining the `vis` array to track the love/hate status of each character.
3. **Edge Cases Handling**: The code handles the following scenarios:
   - If any three characters form a love triangle that violates the conditions, the function returns `False`.
   - If the entire graph can be consistently labeled according to the given relationships, the function returns `True`.
4. **Modulo Operation**: The final result is computed modulo \(1,000,000,007\) to handle large numbers, ensuring that the output fits within standard integer limits.
5. **Input Processing**: The `func_2` function correctly processes the input and initializes the necessary data structures before calling `func_1`.

Given the annotations and the code, the program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. There are no examples provided in the problem description or in the annotations that show the program failing to meet the requirements. Therefore, the code is correct.
