Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not fully address the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` seems to attempt to verify the consistency of the relationships starting from a given node `u`, but it does not handle the overall consistency check for all nodes and edges as required. The program also lacks handling for the cases where no valid configuration exists, which is evident in the third example provided.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incomplete Handling of Relationships**: The function `func_1` checks the consistency of relationships starting from a node `u`. However, it does not ensure that all relationships are consistent across the entire graph. This means that the function might not catch all invalid configurations, especially when multiple nodes and their relationships are involved.

2. **Lack of Consistency Check**: The problem requires ensuring that for every set of three characters, either exactly one pair is in love and the other two hate each other, or all three pairs are in love. The current implementation does not explicitly check this condition for every possible triplet of characters.

3. **Incorrect Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation in the final answer is performed using `mod`, which is not defined in the provided code. This needs to be defined before using it.

4. **Potential Missing Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the initial set of relationships leads to an inconsistent graph, such as the third example provided.

Given these issues, the program cannot be considered fully correct as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
