Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code fails to ensure that the graph can be split into disjoint sets where each set satisfies the "love" condition (exactly one pair in love or all pairs in love) for every triangle. 

Here is a specific counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
4 4
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 0
4 1 0
```

According to the problem description, the correct answer should be 1 because the only possible solution is to make 1 and 3 love each other and 2 and 4 hate each other. However, the provided code returns 0, which is incorrect.

This failure indicates that the code is not correctly checking all possible configurations and ensuring that the resulting graph satisfies the required conditions for every triangle. The code only checks the consistency of the relationships during the DFS traversal but does not verify that the overall graph configuration meets the criteria specified in the problem description.
