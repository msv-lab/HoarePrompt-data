You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are many anime that are about "love triangles": Alice loves Bob, and Charlie loves Bob as well, but Alice hates Charlie. You are thinking about an anime which has n characters. The characters are labeled from 1 to n. Every pair of two characters can either mutually love each other or mutually hate each other (there is no neutral state).

You hate love triangles (A-B are in love and B-C are in love, but A-C hate each other), and you also hate it when nobody is in love. So, considering any three characters, you will be happy if exactly one pair is in love (A and B love each other, and C hates both A and B), or if all three pairs are in love (A loves B, B loves C, C loves A).

You are given a list of m known relationships in the anime. You know for sure that certain pairs love each other, and certain pairs hate each other. You're wondering how many ways you can fill in the remaining relationships so you are happy with every triangle. Two ways are considered different if two characters are in love in one way but hate each other in the other. Print this count modulo 1 000 000 007.

Input

The first line of input will contain two integers n, m (3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 100 000).

The next m lines will contain the description of the known relationships. The i-th line will contain three integers ai, bi, ci. If ci is 1, then ai and bi are in love, otherwise, they hate each other (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, <image>).

Each pair of people will be described no more than once.

Output

Print a single integer equal to the number of ways to fill in the remaining pairs so that you are happy with every triangle modulo 1 000 000 007.

Note

In the first sample, the four ways are to: 

  * Make everyone love each other 
  * Make 1 and 2 love each other, and 3 hate 1 and 2 (symmetrically, we get 3 ways from this). 



In the second sample, the only possible solution is to make 1 and 3 love each other and 2 and 4 hate each other.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
maxn = 100005
mod = 1000000007
e = [[] for i in range(maxn)]
vis = [False for i in range(maxn)]
func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: u is an integer representing a character label in the range [1, n], e is a list of adjacency lists where each entry e[u] is a list of tuples (v, c), where v is another character label in the range [1, n] and c is a boolean indicating whether u and v love each other (True) or hate each other (False); vis is a list of booleans or integers representing the love/hate status of each character, initially set to False.
def func_1(u):
    sz = len(e[u])
    ok = True
    for i in range(sz):
        v = e[u][i][0]
        
        c = e[u][i][1]
        
        if vis[v] == False:
            if c == True:
                vis[v] = vis[u]
            else:
                vis[v] = -vis[u]
            ok = func_1(v)
        
        if c == 1 and vis[v] != vis[u]:
            return False
        
        if c == 0 and vis[v] != -vis[u]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `u` is an integer in the range [1, n], `e` is a list of adjacency lists, `vis` is a list of booleans or integers, `sz` is the length of the list `e[u]`, `ok` is the final return value of `func_1(v)` after all iterations of the loop, `v` is a character label in the range [1, n], and `c` is a boolean indicating whether `u` and `v` love each other (True) or hate each other (False). If the loop executes, `vis[v]` is set to `vis[u]` if `c` is True, and to `-vis[u]` if `c` is False, ensuring that for any two connected nodes, `vis[v]` is either the same as `vis[u]` if they love each other or the negation of `vis[u]` if they hate each other. If the loop does not execute (when `sz` is 0), `vis` remains as its initial state, which is False for all elements.
    return ok
    #The program returns `ok`, which is the final return value of `func_1(v)` after all iterations of the loop, considering the values of `vis[v]` based on whether `u` and `v` love or hate each other

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 100 000. e is a list of adjacency lists where e[i] contains pairs [v, c] for each vertex v connected to vertex i with a relationship described by c (c is 1 if they love each other and 0 if they hate each other). vis is a boolean list of length n indicating whether each character has been visited during the graph traversal. mod is an integer representing the modulo value (1 000 000 007).
def func_2():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, c = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        e[u].append([v, c])
        
        e[v].append([u, c])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive; `m` is the total number of edges added; `i` is `m-1`; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n`; `mod` is 1,000,000,007; `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1; `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge; `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added by the loop.
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if vis[i] == False:
            vis[i] = True
            cnt += 1
            if func_1(i) == False:
                cnt = 0
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive; `m` is the total number of edges added and satisfies `1 <= m < n+1`; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` where exactly `m` elements are set to `True`; `mod` is 1,000,000,007; `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1; `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge; `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added by the loop; `cnt` is 0. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `cnt` will be 0, meaning no node was found to violate the condition in `func_1(i)` during any iteration. If the loop breaks, `cnt` will be 0 and exactly `m` nodes were visited.
    ans = 1
    if (cnt == 0) :
        ans = 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 3 and 100,000 inclusive; `m` is the total number of edges added and satisfies `1 <= m < n+1`; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` where exactly `m` elements are set to `True`; `mod` is 1,000,000,007; `u` and `v` are integers representing the nodes connected by an edge, each decremented by 1; `c` is an integer representing the cost of the edge; `e[u]` and `e[v]` are adjacency lists containing all the edges added by the loop; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is 1, as it starts from 1 and is not modified in the if part since `cnt == 0`.
    for i in (1, cnt):
        ans *= 2
        
        ans %= mod
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State:
    print(ans)


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
