Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine the number of ways to fill in the remaining relationships among the characters such that the specified conditions are met. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Graph Representation and Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the input values for `n` and `m` and constructs the graph using adjacency lists (`e`).
   - Each edge is represented as a tuple `[v, c]` where `v` is the neighboring vertex and `c` is the relationship (1 for love, 0 for hate).
   - The program handles the constraints and ensures that each pair is described at most once.

2. **Graph Traversal and Relationship Checking:**
   - The function `func_1(u)` recursively checks if a consistent assignment of love and hate can be made starting from vertex `u`. It ensures that:
     - If `u` and `v` love each other (`c == 1`), their relationship signs must match (`vis[u] == vis[v]`).
     - If `u` and `v` hate each other (`c == 0`), their relationship signs must be opposite (`vis[u] == -vis[v]`).
   - The function `func_1(u)` updates the `vis` array and returns `True` if a consistent assignment is possible, otherwise `False`.

3. **Initial Visits and Consistency Check:**
   - In `func_2()`, the program iterates over all vertices to ensure each component is visited.
   - If a component is not visited, it sets the `vis` array for that component and calls `func_1()` to check consistency.
   - If any component fails the consistency check, the program sets `cnt` to 0 and breaks out of the loop, indicating an invalid configuration.

4. **Counting Valid Configurations:**
   - Once all components are checked, if no component failed, `cnt` will be the number of components.
   - The program then calculates the number of valid configurations using the formula \(2^{(cnt-1)}\), accounting for the initial component being fixed.
   - The result is taken modulo \(1,000,000,007\) to handle large numbers.

### Conclusion:

The program accurately implements the logic required to verify the relationships and count the valid configurations based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
