The function `func_1` accepts an integer `u`, a list of adjacency lists `e`, and a list `vis`. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the graph represented by `e`, updating the `vis` list based on the relationship (love or hate) between `u` and each of its neighbors. For each neighbor `v`, if `vis[v]` is not yet set, `vis[v]` is updated to `vis[u]` if `u` and `v` love each other (`c == True`), or to `-vis[u]` if they hate each other (`c == False`). The function recursively calls itself for each neighbor. If at any point the relationships violate the conditions (either loving characters have different signs in `vis` or hating characters have the same sign), the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `ok`, which is the final return value of the recursive calls, ensuring that the `vis` list maintains the required relationship signs for all connected components. The function can only return `True` (or `ok` being `True`) if the entire graph can be consistently labeled according to the given relationships without violating any conditions.
