The variable `zeros` is assigned the value `1`. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 10, `countsa` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts` with `countsa[10]` decremented by 1, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts` with `countsb[10]` decremented by 1, `mxZeros` is 0, `mni10` is a positive integer greater than 0, `zeros` is 1**
