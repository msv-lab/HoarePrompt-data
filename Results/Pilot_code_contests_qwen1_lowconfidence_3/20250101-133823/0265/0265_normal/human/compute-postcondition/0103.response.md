`countsa[j]` is decremented by `mn`. The value of `mn` is the minimum of `countsa[j]` and `countsb[j9]`, and it is greater than 0. After the subtraction, `countsa[j]` will be equal to its original value minus `mn`.

Output State: **`j9` is equal to `pair9s[j]`, `mn` is the minimum of `countsa[j]` and `countsb[j9]`, and `countsa[j]` is equal to `countsa[j] - mn`, where `mn` is greater than 0**
