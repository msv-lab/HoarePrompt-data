Postcondition: ***`i` is 10, `countsa` and `countsb` are shallow copies of `baseCounts`, `mxZeros` is updated if the condition `mxZeros < zeros` is true, specifically, `mxZString[0]` is updated by adding `str(i) * 9 + '0' * 10` to its current value, `mxZString[1]` is the concatenated string formed by appending `mn9s[10]` repetitions of each digit `9-10` from 0 to 9, and now includes `str(-i10) * (-i10)` appended to its previous value, `print` outputs a dictionary with keys `v` and `mxZString`. If the condition `mxZeros < zeros` is false, the variables retain their pre-execution values.***
