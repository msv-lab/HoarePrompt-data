`j9` is assigned the value of `pair9s[j]`. The original value of `j9` was `pair9s[0]`. After the assignment, `j9` now holds the value of `pair9s[j]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j9` is `pair9s[j]`, `mn` is the minimum of `countsa[0]` and `countsb[j9]`, `countsa[10]` remains unchanged, `countsb[j9]` remains unchanged, `zeros` remains unchanged, and `mn9s[0]` is set to `mn`**
