The code snippet modifies `mxZString[1]` by appending `str(9 - j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times. Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. The initial state of `mxZString[1]` is defined such that it contains the original value of `mxZString[1]` appended with `str(10 - j)` repeated `mn9s[j - 1]` times, followed by `str(9 - j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times, and then `str(9 - j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times.

2. After executing the line `mxZString[1] += str(9 - j) * mn9s[j]`, `mxZString[1]` will have an additional `str(9 - j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times appended to its current value.

Therefore, the updated value of `mxZString[1]` will include the original content plus the additional part specified in the code.

Output State: **`j` is between 1 and 10 (inclusive); `mxZString[0]` is the original value of `mxZString[0]` appended with `str(j-1)` repeated `mn9s[j-1]` times, followed by `str(j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times, and then `str(j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times; `mxZString[1]` is the original value of `mxZString[1]` appended with `str(10-j)` repeated `mn9s[j-1]` times, followed by `str(9-j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times, and then `str(9-j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times, and finally `str(9-j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times.**
