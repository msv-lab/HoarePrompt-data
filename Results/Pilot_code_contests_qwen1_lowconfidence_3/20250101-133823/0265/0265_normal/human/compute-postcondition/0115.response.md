Postcondition: ***`j9` is equal to `pair9s[j]`, `mn` is the minimum of `countsa[j]` and `countsb[j9]`, `countsa[10]` remains unchanged, `countsb[j9]` remains unchanged, `zeros` remains unchanged, and `mn9s[10]` is set to `mn`. If `mn > 0`, then `countsa[10]` is decremented by `mn`, `countsb[j9]` is decremented by `mn`, `zeros` is incremented by `mn`, and `mn9s[j]` is set to `mn`.***
