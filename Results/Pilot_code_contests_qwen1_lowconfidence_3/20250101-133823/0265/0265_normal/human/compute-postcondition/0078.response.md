`mxZString[0]` is updated to append `str(j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times to its current value. The value of `j` is between 1 and 10 (inclusive). For each `j`, the original value of `mxZString[0]` was the original value of `mxZString[0]` appended with `str(j-1)` repeated `mn9s[j-1]` times, and the original value of `mxZString[1]` was the original value of `mxZString[1]` appended with `str(10-j)` repeated `mn9s[j-1]` times.

After executing the code, the value of `mxZString[0]` will be the original value of `mxZString[0]` appended with `str(j-1)` repeated `mn9s[j-1]` times, followed by `str(j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times. The value of `mxZString[1]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is between 1 and 10 (inclusive); `mxZString[0]` is the original value of `mxZString[0]` appended with `str(j-1)` repeated `mn9s[j-1]` times, followed by `str(j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times; `mxZString[1]` is the original value of `mxZString[1]` appended with `str(10-j)` repeated `mn9s[j-1]` times.**
