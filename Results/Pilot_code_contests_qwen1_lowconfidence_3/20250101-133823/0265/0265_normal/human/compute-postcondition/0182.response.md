`zeros` is incremented by `mn`. From the initial state, `mn` is the minimum between `countsa[1]` and `countsb[pair9s[1]]`. The value of `zeros` was `1 + mn`, so now `zeros` becomes `(1 + mn) + mn = 1 + 2*mn`.

The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`countsa[0]` is `countsa[0] - mn`, `countsa[1]` is `countsa[0] - 2*mn`, `countsa[2:]` are the same as the initial `baseCounts[2:]`, `countsb[pair9s[0]]` is `countsb[pair9s[0]] - mn`, `countsb[pair9s[1]]` is `baseCounts[pair9s[1]] - 2 - mn`, `countsb[i]` is `countsb[i] - 2` for all `i`, `countsb[i+1:]` are the same as the initial `baseCounts[i+1:]`, `mxZeros` retains its updated value, `mni10` is 1, `mxZString[0]` and `mxZString[1]` retain their updated values, `zeros` is `1 + 2*mn`, `mn9s` is `[mn, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, `j` is 2, `j9` is `pair9s[1]`, `mn` is the minimum between `countsa[1]` and `countsb[pair9s[1]]`.**
