`countsa[i]` is decremented by 1, where `i` is 10. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 10, `countsa` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts` with `countsa[10]` decremented by 1, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `mxZeros` is 0, `mni10` is a positive integer greater than 0**
