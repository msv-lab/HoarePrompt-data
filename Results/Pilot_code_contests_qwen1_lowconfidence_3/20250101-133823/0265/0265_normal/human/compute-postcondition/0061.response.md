Postcondition: ***`i` is 10, `countsa` and `countsb` are shallow copies of `baseCounts`, `mxZeros` is 0, `mni10` is 0, `j` is 10, `j9` is the value at index 0 of `pair9s`, `countsa[0]` is `x - min(x, countsb[0])`, `countsb[0]` is `countsb[0] - mn0`, `mn9s[j]` is 0, `zeros` is `1 + min(x, countsb[0])`, `mn0` is `min(x, countsb[0])`. The condition `mxZeros < zeros` is true.***
