According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range specified by `range(10)`, which means `i` must be between 0 and 9 inclusive.

Before the loop starts, the state is given as follows:
- `digits` is a string representing a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105.
- `pair9s` is an empty dictionary `{}`.

The loop itself does not depend on `digits` or `pair9s`, but only on `i`. Therefore, the initial values of `digits` and `pair9s` do not affect the ability of the loop to execute. However, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to a value within the range of the loop.

State: **`i` is 0, `digits` is a string representing a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105, `pair9s` is an empty dictionary {}**
