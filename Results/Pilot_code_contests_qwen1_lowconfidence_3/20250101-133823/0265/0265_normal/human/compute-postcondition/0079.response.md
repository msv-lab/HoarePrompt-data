The code updates `mxZString[1]` by appending `str(9 - j) * mn9s[j]` to its current value. Given the initial state, we know that `mxZString[1]` was initially set to the original value of `mxZString[1]` appended with `str(10 - j)` repeated `mn9s[j-1]` times.

Since `j` is between 1 and 10 (inclusive), `9 - j` ranges from 8 to 0. Therefore, the new value of `mxZString[1]` will be the original value of `mxZString[1]` plus `str(9 - j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times.

Output State: **`j` is between 1 and 10 (inclusive); `mxZString[0]` is the original value of `mxZString[0]` appended with `str(j-1)` repeated `mn9s[j-1]` times, followed by `str(j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times; `mxZString[1]` is the original value of `mxZString[1]` appended with `str(10-j)` repeated `mn9s[j-1]` times, followed by `str(9-j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times.**
