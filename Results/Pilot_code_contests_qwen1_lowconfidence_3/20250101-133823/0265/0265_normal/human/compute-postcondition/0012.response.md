The code `baseCounts[int(digit)] += 1` increments the count at the index corresponding to the integer value of `digit` in the `baseCounts` list. Since `digits` is a string representing a positive integer, let's assume the first digit of `digits` (denoted as `digit`) is '1' for this example.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 11
- `digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer
- `pair9s` is a dictionary containing `{0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7, 3: 6, 4: 5, 5: 4, 6: 3, 7: 2, 8: 1, 9: 0}`
- `baseCounts` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` with the element at index `int(digit)` incremented by 1

Since the first digit of `digits` is '1', the line `baseCounts[int(digit)] += 1` will increment `baseCounts[1]` by 1, making `baseCounts` equal to `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 11, `digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer, `pair9s` is {0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7, 3: 6, 4: 5, 5: 4, 6: 3, 7: 2, 8: 1, 9: 0}, `baseCounts` is [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]**
