The code initializes an empty dictionary called `pair9s`. This does not affect the value of the `digits` string. Therefore, the `digits` string remains unchanged.

Output State: **`digits` is a string representing a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105; `pair9s` is an empty dictionary {}**
