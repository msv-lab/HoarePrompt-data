You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an else statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account that the program does not enter the if block and goes to the lese block instead. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement. WE DO NOT FOLLOW THE IF CONDITION IN THIS CASE. WE ENTER THE ELSE BLOCK.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after not entering the if block and instead enetering the else block . So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is false. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is more than or equal to 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` can have any value except an integer one`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive larger or equal to 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, a is a list of integers
if condition:
```
if n <=0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. n is larger than 0, a is a list of integers***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have executed.

### Initial State
- \( i \) is 10.
- \( \text{digits} \) is a non-empty string representing a positive integer.
- \( \text{pair9s} \) is a dictionary mapping each digit to its complement (e.g., {0: 9, 1: 8, ..., 9: 0}).
- \( \text{baseCounts} \) is an array where \( \text{baseCounts}[d] \) is the count of digit \( d \) in \( \text{digits} \).
- \( \text{itens} \) is -1.
- \( \text{mxZeros} \) is 0.

### Loop Code Analysis
The loop iterates over \( i \) from 1 to 5. For each iteration, it performs several operations including updating the counts, calculating zeros, and potentially updating the maximum zeros count and the corresponding strings.

### Iteration Analysis
#### After the First Iteration
- \( \text{i} = 10 \)
- \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \) are shallow copies of \( \text{baseCounts} \).
- \( \text{zeros} \) is calculated based on the minimum counts of the current digit and its complement.
- If \( \text{mni10} > 0 \), it updates \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \) and increments \( \text{zeros} \).
- \( \text{mxZeros} \) is updated if \( \text{mxZeros} < \text{zeros} \).

#### After the Second Iteration
- \( \text{i} = 9 \)
- Similar operations as above, but with updated \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \).

#### After the Third Iteration
- \( \text{i} = 8 \)
- Similar operations as above, but with further updated \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \).

#### After the Fourth Iteration
- \( \text{i} = 7 \)
- Similar operations as above, but with even further updated \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \).

#### After the Fifth Iteration
- \( \text{i} = 6 \)
- Similar operations as above, but with the final updates to \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \).

### Final State Analysis
After all iterations, the following conditions hold:
- \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \) will be the result of decrementing the counts based on the minimum counts of the current digit and its complement.
- \( \text{mxZeros} \) will be the maximum number of zeros found during the iterations.
- \( \text{mxZString} \) will be the string representation of the maximum zero count configuration.

### Determining the Output State
Given the operations within the loop and the final conditions, we can summarize the output state as follows:

- \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \) will be the remaining counts of each digit after all iterations.
- \( \text{mxZeros} \) will be the maximum number of zeros achieved.
- \( \text{mxZString} \) will be the string representation of the maximum zero count configuration.

### Final Output State
**Output State: **`i` is 6, `countsa` and `countsb` are arrays where `countsa[d]` and `countsb[d]` are the remaining counts of digit `d` after all iterations, `mxZeros` is the maximum number of zeros achieved, `mxZString` is a list containing two strings representing the maximum zero count configuration, `iTen` is -6, `mxZString[0]` and `mxZString[1]` are the final strings formed based on the remaining counts and the maximum zero count configuration.
if condition:
```
if (mxZeros == 0):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition .All the information of the precondition must be included in the postcondition and additionally the negation of the if condition must also be included. Give the overall state of the program for the program after it does not enter the if condition and instead enters the else.
