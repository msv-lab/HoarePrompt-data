The code initializes a list `mn9s` with 10 zeros using the expression `[0] * 10`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state will include the new list `mn9s` along with the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `i10` is 9, `countsa` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `mxZeros` retains its updated value, `mxZString[0]` retains its updated value, `mxZString[1]` retains its updated value, `zeros` is 0, `mn9s` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]**
