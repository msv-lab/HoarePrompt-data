The code snippet updates the dictionary `pair9s` by assigning the value `9 - i` to the key `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is currently 2. So, `pair9s[2]` will be updated to `9 - 2`, which is `7`. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged: `digits` is a string representing a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105.

Therefore, the updated state is:
**`i` is 2, `digits` is a string representing a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105, `pair9s` is a dictionary containing `{0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7}`.**

Output State: **`i` is 2, `digits` is a string representing a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105, `pair9s` is a dictionary containing `{0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7}`.**
