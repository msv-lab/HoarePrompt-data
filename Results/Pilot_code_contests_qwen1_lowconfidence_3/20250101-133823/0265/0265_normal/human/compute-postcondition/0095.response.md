The code snippet prints the values of the variables `i`, `countsa`, `countsb`, `mxZeros`, and `mni10`. However, the print statement itself does not modify any of these variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `countsa`, `countsb`, `mxZeros`, and `mni10` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `countsa` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `mxZeros` retains its updated value, `mxZString[0]` retains its updated value, `mxZString[1]` retains its updated value, `zeros` is 0, `mn9s` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `mni10` is `min(1, countsa[1], countsb[9])`**
