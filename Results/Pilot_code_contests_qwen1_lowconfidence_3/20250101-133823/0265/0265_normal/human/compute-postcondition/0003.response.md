Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 0.
   - `digits` is a string representing a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105.
   - `pair9s` is a dictionary containing `{0: 9}`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(10)`.
   - This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = 9`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 (the first iteration).

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute the next iteration, `i` must be incremented to 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.

5. **Other States**:
   - The state of `digits` and `pair9s` remains unchanged as there is no information indicating any modifications to these variables within the loop body.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - To proceed to the next iteration, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1.
   - The states of `digits` and `pair9s` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
**`i` is 1, `digits` is a string representing a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105, `pair9s` is a dictionary containing `{0: 9}`**.
