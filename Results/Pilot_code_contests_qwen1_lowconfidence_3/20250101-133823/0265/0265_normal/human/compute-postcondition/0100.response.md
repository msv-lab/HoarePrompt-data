The code snippet `j9 = pair9s[j]` assigns the value of `pair9s[j]` to `j9`. However, without knowing the specific values of `pair9s` and `j`, we cannot determine the exact value of `j9`. Therefore, the only change in the output state is the assignment of `pair9s[j]` to `j9`.

Output State: **`j9` is equal to `pair9s[j]`, no other changes.**
