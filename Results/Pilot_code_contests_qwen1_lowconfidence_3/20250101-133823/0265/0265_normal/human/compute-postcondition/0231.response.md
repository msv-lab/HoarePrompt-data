The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `digits`. `digits` is a string representing a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105. The function has two cases for its output:

- Case_1: The function returns four values: `countsa` and `countsb`, which are arrays where `countsa[d]` and `countsb[d]` are the remaining counts of digit `d` after all iterations, and `mxZeros` which is 0, and `iTen` which is -6.
- Case_2: The function returns a tuple containing two strings `mxZString[0]` and `mxZString[1]`, which represent the final strings formed based on the remaining counts and the maximum zero count configuration.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `digits` and return either specific array values and integers or two strings based on certain conditions.
