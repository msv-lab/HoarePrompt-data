`zeros` is incremented by `mn`. The value of `mn` is the minimum of `countsa[j]` (before decrement) and `countsb[j9]`. Therefore, `zeros` is updated by adding `mn`.

Output State: **`j9` is the value at index `j` of `pair9s`, `j` is unchanged, `pair9s` is unchanged, `countsa[j]` is the original value of `countsa[j]` minus `mn`, `countsb[j9]` is the original value of `countsb[j9]` minus `mn`, `mn` is the minimum of `countsa[j]` (before decrement) and `countsb[j9]`, `zeros` is updated by adding `mn`**
