Postcondition: **`i` is 6, `countsa` and `countsb` are arrays where `countsa[d]` and `countsb[d]` are the remaining counts of digit `d` after all iterations, `mxZeros` is the maximum number of zeros achieved, `mxZString` is a list containing two strings representing the maximum zero count configuration, `iTen` is -6, `mxZString[0]` and `mxZString[1]` are the final strings formed based on the remaining counts and the maximum zero count configuration, and `mxZeros` is 0**.
