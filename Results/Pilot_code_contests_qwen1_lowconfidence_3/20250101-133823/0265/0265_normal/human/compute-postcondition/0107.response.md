Postcondition: ***`j9` is equal to `pair9s[j]`, `mn` is the minimum of `countsa[j]` and `countsb[j9]`. If `mn > 0`, then `countsa[j]` is reduced by `mn`, `countsb[j9]` is reduced by `mn`, `zeros` is incremented by `mn`, and `mn9s[j]` is set to `mn`. Otherwise, no changes occur to these variables.***
