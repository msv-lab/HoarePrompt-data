Postcondition: ***`mxZString[0]` and `mxZString[1]` are strings constructed based on the rules specified in the if part. `mxZString[0]` starts with digits 0 to 9 repeated according to `countsa[0]`, followed by '0' repeated `mn9s[0]` times, then '1' repeated `mn9s[1]` times, and so on until '9' repeated `mn9s[9]` times, plus the string `str(i)` repeated `mni10` times, followed by the string '0' repeated `mn0` times. `mxZString[1]` follows a similar pattern but starts with digits 0 to 9 repeated according to `countsb[0]`, followed by '9' repeated `mn9s[0]` times, then '8' repeated `mn9s[1]` times, and so on until '0' repeated `mn9s[9]` times, and then appended by `str(i10) * mni10 + '0' * mn0`. `j` is 10, `i` is 10, `v` is 2 in the printed dictionary. This is true if `mxZeros` is less than `zeros`. If `mxZeros` is not less than `zeros`, the conditions remain as per the initial state before the if-else block executes.***
