The code `j9 = pair9s[j]` assigns the value at index `j` of the list `pair9s` to the variable `j9`. However, since the initial state does not provide the exact values of `j` and `pair9s`, we can only express the new state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`j9` is the value at index `j` of `pair9s`, `j` is unchanged, and `pair9s` is unchanged.**
