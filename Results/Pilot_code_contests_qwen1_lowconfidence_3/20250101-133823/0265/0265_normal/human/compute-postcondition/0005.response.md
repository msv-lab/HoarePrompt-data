According to the given code snippet, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to 9, meaning `i` starts at 0 and increases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 9. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and the dictionary `pair9s` is updated to `{0: 9, 1: 8}`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The dictionary `pair9s` will then be updated to include the new key-value pair `{2: 7}`, as `9 - 2` equals `7`.

The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged: `digits` is a string representing a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105.

Therefore, the updated state is:
**`i` is 2, `digits` is a string representing a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105, `pair9s` is a dictionary containing `{0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7}`.**
