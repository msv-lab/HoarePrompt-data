Let's analyze the given information and the for loop step by step.

### Given Information:
- `j` is between 0 and 9 (inclusive).
- `mxZString[0]` is the original value of `mxZString[0]` appended with `str(j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times.
- `mxZString[1]` is the original value of `mxZString[1]` appended with `str(9-j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times.

### For Loop:
```
for j in range(10):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 9 inclusive.
- After each iteration, `j` increases by 1.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is between 0 and 9.
   - `mxZString[0]` is the original value of `mxZString[0]` appended with `str(j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times.
   - `mxZString[1]` is the original value of `mxZString[1]` appended with `str(9-j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times.

2. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - Suppose `j` was `k` (where `k` is some integer between 0 and 9).
   - `mxZString[0]` would have been updated with `str(k)` repeated `mn9s[k]` times.
   - `mxZString[1]` would have been updated with `str(9-k)` repeated `mn9s[k]` times.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `j` will increase by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will now be `k + 1`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - `j` must now be `k + 1`, which means `j` must be 1 more than its previous value.
   - `mxZString[0]` will be updated with `str(k + 1)` repeated `mn9s[k+1]` times.
   - `mxZString[1]` will be updated with `str(9-(k+1))` repeated `mn9s[k+1]` times.

### Final Answer:
State: **`j` is between 1 and 10 (inclusive); `mxZString[0]` is the original value of `mxZString[0]` appended with `str(j-1)` repeated `mn9s[j-1]` times; `mxZString[1]` is the original value of `mxZString[1]` appended with `str(10-j)` repeated `mn9s[j-1]` times.**
