`mxZeros` is assigned the value of `zeros`. From the initial state, `zeros` is equal to `mn0`. Therefore, `mxZeros` is now `mn0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`i` is 1, `countsa[0]` is `countsa[0] - mn0`, `countsb[0]` is `countsb[0] - mn0`, `countsb` and `countsa` are shallow copies of `baseCounts`, `mxZeros` is `mn0`, `mxZString[0]` and `mxZString[1]` retain their updated values, `zeros` is `mn0`, `mn9s` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, `mni10` is `min(1, countsa[1], countsb[9])`**
