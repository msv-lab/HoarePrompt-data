The code appends the string representation of `j` (`"1"`) multiplied by `mn9s[j]` (which is `mn9s[0]`) to `mxZString[0]`. 

From the initial state:
- `j` is `1`.
- `mxZString[0]` is the concatenation of digits 0 to 9 repeated according to `countsa[0]` followed by '0' repeated `mn9s[0]` times.
- `mxZString[1]` is the concatenation of digits 0 to 9 repeated according to `countsb[0]` plus '9' repeated `mn9s[0]` times.

After executing the code:
- `mxZString[0]` becomes the original `mxZString[0]` plus `"1"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`j` is 1; `mxZString[0]` is the concatenation of digits 0 to 9 repeated according to `countsa[0]` followed by '0' repeated `mn9s[0]` times and then by the string "1" repeated `mn9s[0]` times; `mxZString[1]` is the concatenation of digits 0 to 9 repeated according to `countsb[0]` plus '9' repeated `mn9s[0]` times.**
