At the start of the next iteration, `i` is 1. The code snippet `pair9s[i] = 9 - i` modifies the dictionary `pair9s`. Specifically, it sets the value of the key `i` (which is 1) to `9 - i` (which is 8). 

Before this line of code, the dictionary `pair9s` contained `{0: 9}`. After executing the line `pair9s[i] = 9 - i`, the dictionary `pair9s` will be updated to include the new key-value pair `{1: 8}`. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`i` is 1, `digits` is a string representing a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105, `pair9s` is a dictionary containing `{0: 9, 1: 8}`.**
