Postcondition: ***`j9` is `pair9s[j]`; `mn` is the minimum of `countsa[j]` and `countsb[j9]`; `countsa[10]` remains unchanged; `countsb[j9]` is `countsb[j9] - mn`; `zeros` is `zeros + mn`; `mn9s[0]` is the minimum of `countsa[0]` and `countsb[j9]`; `countsa[j]` is `countsa[j] - mn`; `mn9s[j]` is `mn`. All these changes are made if `mn > 0`. If `mn` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to the variables.***
