Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is between 1 and 10 (inclusive).
   - `mxZString[0]` is the original value of `mxZString[0]` appended with `str(j-1)` repeated `mn9s[j-1]` times, followed by `str(j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times.
   - `mxZString[1]` is the original value of `mxZString[1]` appended with `str(10-j)` repeated `mn9s[j-1]` times, followed by `str(9-j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from 0 to 9 (inclusive). This means `j` will be incremented from its previous value.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `j`:**
   - If `j` was previously between 1 and 10, the next value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j + 1` must be within the range of 0 to 9.

4. **Check the Range:**
   - Since `j` was between 1 and 10, the maximum value of `j` was 10.
   - Therefore, the next value of `j` would be 11, which is outside the range of 0 to 9.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The loop will not execute again because `j` cannot be 11 if it was previously 10.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - The states do not need to be adjusted further as the loop condition is no longer met.

Therefore, the final state is the same as the initial state since the loop does not continue.

**State: **`j` is between 1 and 10 (inclusive); `mxZString[0]` is the original value of `mxZString[0]` appended with `str(j-1)` repeated `mn9s[j-1]` times, followed by `str(j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times; `mxZString[1]` is the original value of `mxZString[1]` appended with `str(10-j)` repeated `mn9s[j-1]` times, followed by `str(9-j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times.**
