`j` is 1; `mxZString[0]` is the concatenation of digits 0 to 9 repeated according to `countsa[0]` followed by '0' repeated `mn9s[0]` times and then by the string "1" repeated `mn9s[0]` times; `mxZString[1]` is the concatenation of digits 0 to 9 repeated according to `countsb[0]` plus '9' repeated `mn9s[0]` times.

The code `mxZString[1] += str(9 - j) * mn9s[j]` is executed. Given that `j` is 1, the expression `str(9 - j) * mn9s[j]` simplifies to `str(8) * mn9s[1]`, which is `"8"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times.

Therefore, `mxZString[1]` is updated by appending `"8"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times to its current value.

Output State: **`j` is 1; `mxZString[0]` is the concatenation of digits 0 to 9 repeated according to `countsa[0]` followed by '0' repeated `mn9s[0]` times and then by the string "1" repeated `mn9s[0]` times; `mxZString[1]` is the concatenation of digits 0 to 9 repeated according to `countsb[0]` plus '9' repeated `mn9s[0]` times and then by the string "8" repeated `mn9s[1]` times.**
