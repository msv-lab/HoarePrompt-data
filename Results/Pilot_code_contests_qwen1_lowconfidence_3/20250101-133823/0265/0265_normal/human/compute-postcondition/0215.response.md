Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `j` is 0
   - `mxZString[0]` is the concatenation of digits 0 to 9 repeated according to `countsa[0]` followed by '0' repeated `mn9s[0]` times
   - `mxZString[1]` is the concatenation of digits 0 to 9 repeated according to `countsb[0]` plus '9' repeated `mn9s[0]` times

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range(10), meaning it will iterate from `j = 0` to `j = 9`.

3. **Current Iteration**: Since `j` is currently 0, the loop will proceed to the next iteration when `j` becomes 1.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - The value of `j` will increase by 1, so `j` will be 1.
   - The values of `mxZString[0]` and `mxZString[1]` remain unchanged as they depend on the current iteration's index (`j`) and the initial conditions provided do not change within the loop body (based on the information given).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (when `j` is 1) will be:

State: **`j` is 1; `mxZString[0]` is the concatenation of digits 0 to 9 repeated according to `countsa[0]` followed by '0' repeated `mn9s[0]` times; `mxZString[1]` is the concatenation of digits 0 to 9 repeated according to `countsb[0]` plus '9' repeated `mn9s[0]` times**
