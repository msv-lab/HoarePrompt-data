The code `print(dict(v=2, mxZString=mxZString))` creates a dictionary with keys `v` and `mxZString` and prints it. The value of `v` is set to 2, and `mxZString` retains its previous values. The previous state of `mxZString` is as follows:
- `mxZString[0]` is a string formed by `str(i) * mni10 + '0' * mn0`
- `mxZString[1]` is a string formed by `str(i10) * mni10 + '0' * mn0`

Since the code does not modify `mxZString` or any other variables, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`mxZString[0]'s value is updated to include the string `str(i) * mni10 + '0' * mn0', `mxZString[1]'s value is updated to include the string `str(i10) * mni10 + '0' * mn0', `v` is 2**
