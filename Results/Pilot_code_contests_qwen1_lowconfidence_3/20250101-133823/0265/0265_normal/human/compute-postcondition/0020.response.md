The code `countsb = baseCounts[:]` creates a shallow copy of the `baseCounts` list and assigns it to `countsb`. This means that `countsb` now holds the same values as `baseCounts`, but they are separate lists. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`i` is 10, `digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer, `pair9s` is {0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7, 3: 6, 4: 5, 5: 4, 6: 3, 7: 2, 8: 1, 9: 0}, `baseCounts` is an array where `baseCounts[digit]` is the count of the digit `digit` in `digits`, `iTen` is -1, `mxZeros` is 0, `countsa` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`**
