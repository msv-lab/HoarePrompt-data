The code snippet `mxZString[0] += str(j) * mn9s[j]` appends `str(j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times to `mxZString[0]`.

From the initial state:
- `j` is between 1 and 10 (inclusive).
- `mxZString[0]` is the original value of `mxZString[0]` appended with `str(j-1)` repeated `mn9s[j-1]` times, followed by `str(j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times.
- `mxZString[1]` is the original value of `mxZString[1]` appended with `str(10-j)` repeated `mn9s[j-1]` times, followed by `str(9-j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times.

After executing the code, `mxZString[0]` will have the additional `str(j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times appended to it.

Therefore, the updated `mxZString[0]` will be:
- The original value of `mxZString[0]` plus `str(j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times.

The states of the other variables (`j`, `mxZString[1]`, and `mn9s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is between 1 and 10 (inclusive); `mxZString[0]` is the original value of `mxZString[0]` appended with `str(j-1)` repeated `mn9s[j-1]` times, followed by `str(j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times, and then `str(j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times; `mxZString[1]` is the original value of `mxZString[1]` appended with `str(10-j)` repeated `mn9s[j-1]` times, followed by `str(9-j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times.**
