The code `mxZString[1] += str(i10) * mni10 + '0' * mn0` updates the value of `mxZString[1]`. However, the values of `i10`, `mni10`, and `mn0` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact string that is added to `mxZString[1]`. We know that `i10` is a variable, `mni10` is `-i10`, and `mn0` is `0`.

Given this, the code adds `str(-i10) * (-i10) + '0' * 0` to `mxZString[1]`. Since `'0' * 0` results in an empty string, the operation simplifies to adding `str(-i10) * (-i10)` to `mxZString[1]`.

The initial state is:
- `j` is 10
- `mxZString[0]` is updated by adding `str(i) * (j-1) + '0' * j` to its current value
- `mxZString[1]` is the concatenated string formed by appending `mn9s[j]` repetitions of each digit `9-j` from 0 to 9

Since the value of `i10` is not specified, we cannot provide a concrete value for the addition. Therefore, the updated state of `mxZString[1]` is that it now includes the string `str(-i10) * (-i10)` appended to its previous value.

Output State: **`j` is 10; `mxZString[0]` is updated by adding `str(i) * (j-1) + '0' * j` to its current value; `mxZString[1]` is the concatenated string formed by appending `mn9s[j]` repetitions of each digit `9-j` from 0 to 9, and now includes `str(-i10) * (-i10)` appended to its previous value**.
