The code `mxZString[1] += str(j) * countsb[j]` updates the value of `mxZString[1]` by concatenating `str(j)` repeated `countsb[j]` times to the existing value of `mxZString[1]`. Given the initial state:

- `j` is 1
- `mxZ` is less than `zeros`
- `mxZString[0]` is its original value plus `"1"` repeated `countsa[1]` times
- `mxZString[1]` is its original value plus `"0"` repeated `countsb[1]` times

Since `j` is 1, `str(j)` is `"1"`. Therefore, `str(j) * countsb[j]` will be `"1"` repeated `countsb[1]` times.

The updated `mxZString[1]` will now include the original value of `mxZString[1]` plus `"1"` repeated `countsb[1]` times. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `mxZ` is less than `zeros`, `mxZString[0]` is its original value plus `"1"` repeated `countsa[1]` times, `mxZString[1]` is its original value plus `"1"` repeated `countsb[1]` times**
