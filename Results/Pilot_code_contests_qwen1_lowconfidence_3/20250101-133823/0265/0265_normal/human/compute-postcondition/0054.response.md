Postcondition: ***`j` is `(j + 3)`, `j9` is the value at index `(j + 5)` of `pair9s`, `countsa[j]` is `countsa[j] - mn`, `countsb[j9]` is `countsb[j9] - 3 * mn`, `mn9s[j]` is equal to the new decrement value `mn`, `zeros` is `2 * (zeros + mn)`, `mn` is the minimum value between `countsa[j]` and `countsb[j9]`, `mn9s[j]` is equal to the new decrement value `mn`, provided that `mn > 0`.***
