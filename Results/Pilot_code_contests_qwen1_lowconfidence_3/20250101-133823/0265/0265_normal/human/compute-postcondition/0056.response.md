Postcondition: ***`i` is 10, `countsa` and `countsb` are shallow copies of `baseCounts`, `mxZeros` is 0, `mni10` is 0. If `mni10` is greater than 0, `j` is 10 + `mni10`, `j9` is the value at index (j - 10) of `pair9s`, `countsa[j]` is `countsa[j] - mnm10`, `countsb[j9]` is `countsb[j9] - mnm10 * mni10`, `mn9s[j]` is equal to the final decrement value `mnm10`, `zeros` is `mni10 * (zeros + mnm10)`, where `mnm10` is the minimum value between `countsa[j]` and `countsb[j9]` and is greater than 0. If `mni10` is 0, `j` remains 10, `j9` remains the value at index 0 of `pair9s`, `countsa[j]` and `countsb[j9]` remain unchanged, `mn9s[j]` is 0, `zeros` remains 1.***
