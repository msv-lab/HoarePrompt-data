`countsb[i10]` is decremented by 1. Given that `i10` is assumed to be `i` from the initial state (since `i` is 10), `countsb[10]` is decremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the updated value of `countsb` will have its 10th index decremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 10, `countsa` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts` with `countsa[10]` decremented by 1, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts` with `countsb[10]` decremented by 1, `mxZeros` is 0, `mni10` is a positive integer greater than 0**
