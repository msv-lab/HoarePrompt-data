Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `countsa` and `countsb` are shallow copies of `baseCounts`, `mxZeros`, `mxZString[0]`, and `mxZString[1]` retain their updated values, `zeros` is 0, `mn9s` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `mni10` is `min(1, countsa[1], countsb[9])`. If `mni10` is greater than 0, `mni10` retains its value. Otherwise, `mni10` remains unchanged.***
