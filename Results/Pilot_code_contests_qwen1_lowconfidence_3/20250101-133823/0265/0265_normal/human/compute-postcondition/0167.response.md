`zeros` is assigned the value `1`. This changes the value of `zeros` from its previous state (unknown) to `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is unknown, `countsa` is the same list as `baseCounts` except for the element at index `i` which has been decreased by 1, `countsb` is the same list as `baseCounts` except for the element at index `i` which has been decreased by 2, `mxZeros` retains its updated value, `mni10` is 1, `mxZString[0]` and `mxZString[1]` retain their updated values, `zeros` is `1`, `mn9s` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]**
