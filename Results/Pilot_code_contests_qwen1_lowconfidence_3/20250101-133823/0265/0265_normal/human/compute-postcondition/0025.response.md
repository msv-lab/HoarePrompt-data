The code snippet provided does not actually modify any variables; it only prints the values of the existing variables `i`, `countsa`, `countsb`, `mxZeros`, and `mni10`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 10, `countsa` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `mxZeros` is 0, `mni10` is 0**
