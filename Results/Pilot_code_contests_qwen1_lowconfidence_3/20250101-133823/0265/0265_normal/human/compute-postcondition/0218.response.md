According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 10. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. **Initial Value of \( j \)**: At the start of the first iteration, \( j \) is 0.
2. **Current Value of \( j \)**: At the end of the previous iteration, \( j \) is 1.
3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as \( j < 10 \).

Since \( j \) is currently 1, it needs to be incremented to 2 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, \( j \) will be 2.

The other variables (`mxZString[0]`, `mxZString[1]`, `countsa[0]`, `countsb[0]`, `mn9s[0]`, and `mn9s[1]`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop counter \( j \).

Thus, the updated state is:

State: **`j` is 2; `mxZString[0]` is the concatenation of digits 0 to 9 repeated according to `countsa[0]` followed by '0' repeated `mn9s[0]` times and then by the string "1" repeated `mn9s[0]` times; `mxZString[1]` is the concatenation of digits 0 to 9 repeated according to `countsb[0]` plus '9' repeated `mn9s[0]` times and then by the string "8" repeated `mn9s[1]` times.**
