The code `i10 = 10 - i` assigns the value of `10 - i` to `i10`. Given that the initial value of `i` is 10, `10 - i` evaluates to `10 - 10`, which is 0. So, `i10` is assigned the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 10, `digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer, `pair9s` is {0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7, 3: 6, 4: 5, 5: 4, 6: 3, 7: 2, 8: 1, 9: 0}, `baseCounts` is an array where `baseCounts[digit]` is the count of the digit `digit` in `digits`, `iTen` is -1, `mxZeros` is 0, `countsa` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `zeros` is 0, `i10` is 0**
