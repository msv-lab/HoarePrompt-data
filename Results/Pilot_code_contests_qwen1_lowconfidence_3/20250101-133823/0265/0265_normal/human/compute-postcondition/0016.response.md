`iTen` is assigned the value `-1`. The values of `i`, `digits`, `pair9s`, and `baseCounts` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 10; `digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer; `pair9s` is {0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7, 3: 6, 4: 5, 5: 4, 6: 3, 7: 2, 8: 1, 9: 0}; `baseCounts` is an array where `baseCounts[digit]` is the count of the digit `digit` in `digits`; `iTen` is -1.

Output State: **`i` is 10; `digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer; `pair9s` is {0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7, 3: 6, 4: 5, 5: 4, 6: 3, 7: 2, 8: 1, 9: 0}; `baseCounts` is an array where `baseCounts[digit]` is the count of the digit `digit` in `digits`; `iTen` is -1.**
