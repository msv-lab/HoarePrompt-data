The line of code `mxZeros = 0` initializes the variable `mxZeros` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `mxZeros` and keeps the values of the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 10, `digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer, `pair9s` is {0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7, 3: 6, 4: 5, 5: 4, 6: 3, 7: 2, 8: 1, 9: 0}, `baseCounts` is an array where `baseCounts[digit]` is the count of the digit `digit` in `digits`, `iTen` is -1, `mxZeros` is 0.**
