`zeros` is assigned the value `1`. The previous value of `zeros` was `0`, so it is now `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `countsa[1]` is one less than its original value, `countsb[1]` is one less than its original value, `countsb[9]` is unchanged, `mxZeros` retains its updated value, `mxZString[0]` retains its updated value, `mxZString[1]` retains its updated value, `zeros` is 1, `mn9s` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `mni10` is `min(1, countsa[1] - 1, countsb[9])`**
