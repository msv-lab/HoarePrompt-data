`countsb[j9]` is decremented by `mn`. The value of `mn` is the minimum of `countsa[j]` and `countsb[j9]`. Therefore, `countsb[j9]` becomes `countsb[j9] - mn`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`j9` is `pair9s[j]`; `mn` is the minimum of `countsa[j]` and `countsb[j9]`; `countsa[10]` remains unchanged; `countsb[j9]` is `countsb[j9] - mn`; `zeros` remains unchanged; `mn9s[0]` is the minimum of `countsa[0]` and `countsb[j9]`; `countsa[j]` is `countsa[j] - mn`.**
