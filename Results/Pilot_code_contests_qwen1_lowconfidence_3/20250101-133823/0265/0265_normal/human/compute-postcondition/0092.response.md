`i10` is assigned the value of `10 - i`. Given that `i` is 1, the value of `i10` is `9`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `i10` is 9, `countsa` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `mxZeros` retains its updated value, `mxZString[0]` retains its updated value, `mxZString[1]` retains its updated value, `zeros` is 0.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `i10` is 9, `countsa` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `mxZeros` retains its updated value, `mxZString[0]` retains its updated value, `mxZString[1]` retains its updated value, `zeros` is 0**
