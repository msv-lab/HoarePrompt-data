`countsa` is assigned a shallow copy of `baseCounts`. The values of `i`, `countsb`, `mxZeros`, `mxZString[0]`, and `mxZString[1]` remain unchanged. The print statement outputs a dictionary with keys `v` and `mxZString`, which was already part of the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `countsa` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `countsb` retains its value, `mxZeros` retains its updated value, `mxZString[0]` retains its updated value, `mxZString[1]` retains its updated value, the print statement outputs a dictionary with keys `v` and `mxZString`**
