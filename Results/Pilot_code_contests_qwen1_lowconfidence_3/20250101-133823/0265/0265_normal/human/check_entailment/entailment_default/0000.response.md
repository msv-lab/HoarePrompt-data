Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the function `func_1` aims to find two permutations of the digits of the input number such that their sum ends with the maximum number of zeroes. However, the implementation has several issues:

1. **Limitation to Five Operations**: The loop that iterates from 1 to 5 limits the number of operations that can be performed. This means the code does not explore all possible permutations and configurations of the digits, which could result in suboptimal solutions.

2. **Incorrect Pairing Logic**: The logic for pairing digits to maximize the number of trailing zeroes is flawed. For instance, the code attempts to pair digits `i` and `10 - i` but does not fully explore other possible pairings that could result in more trailing zeroes.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The code does not handle cases where the input number consists of only one type of digit (e.g., "1111"). In such cases, the function may incorrectly return the original number paired with itself, even though other permutations could potentially yield more trailing zeroes.

To illustrate, consider the input `1111`:
- The code may incorrectly return `1111 1111`, but a better solution could be `1110 1110` which results in a sum of `2220` ending with three zeroes instead of two.

Given these issues, the code does not guarantee finding the optimal solution for all inputs, and thus the program is not correct according to the problem description.
