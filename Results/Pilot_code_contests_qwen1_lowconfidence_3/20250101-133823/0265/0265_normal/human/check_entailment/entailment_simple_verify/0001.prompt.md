You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Andrey's favourite number is n. Andrey's friends gave him two identical numbers n as a New Year present. He hung them on a wall and watched them adoringly.

Then Andrey got bored from looking at the same number and he started to swap digits first in one, then in the other number, then again in the first number and so on (arbitrary number of changes could be made in each number). At some point it turned out that if we sum the resulting numbers, then the number of zeroes with which the sum will end would be maximum among the possible variants of digit permutations in those numbers.

Given number n, can you find the two digit permutations that have this property?

Input

The first line contains a positive integer n — the original number. The number of digits in this number does not exceed 105. The number is written without any leading zeroes.

Output

Print two permutations of digits of number n, such that the sum of these numbers ends with the maximum number of zeroes. The permutations can have leading zeroes (if they are present, they all should be printed). The permutations do not have to be different. If there are several answers, print any of them.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always produce the correct output as required by the problem description. Specifically, the program logic seems overly complex and may not handle all edge cases properly. Here’s a counterexample to demonstrate:

### Counterexample:
**Input:**
```
500
```

**Expected Output:**
```
500
500
```

**Actual Output:**
The program outputs the permutations but does not necessarily maximize the number of trailing zeros when summed. Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Base Case Analysis**: For `500`, the program should ideally produce `500` and `500` since swapping digits in both numbers to maximize trailing zeros results in no change, and the sum `1000` has three trailing zeros.

2. **Logic Review**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to find permutations that maximize trailing zeros by iteratively reducing certain digit pairs and calculating zeros.
   - However, the logic inside the loop for calculating `zeros` and updating `countsa` and `countsb` might not correctly handle all permutations that lead to the maximum number of trailing zeros.

3. **Potential Issue**:
   - The logic to calculate `zeros` and update the counts seems to focus on specific digit pairs like `i` and `10-i`, but it might miss other optimal configurations.

To confirm, let's run the program with the input `500` and observe the output. The program does not guarantee the correct output for all cases, hence it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have executed.
    #
    #### Initial State
    #- \( i \) is 10.
    #- \( \text{digits} \) is a non-empty string representing a positive integer.
    #- \( \text{pair9s} \) is a dictionary mapping each digit to its complement (e.g., {0: 9, 1: 8, ..., 9: 0}).
    #- \( \text{baseCounts} \) is an array where \( \text{baseCounts}[d] \) is the count of digit \( d \) in \( \text{digits} \).
    #- \( \text{itens} \) is -1.
    #- \( \text{mxZeros} \) is 0.
    #
    #### Loop Code Analysis
    #The loop iterates over \( i \) from 1 to 5. For each iteration, it performs several operations including updating the counts, calculating zeros, and potentially updating the maximum zeros count and the corresponding strings.
    #
    #### Iteration Analysis
    ##### After the First Iteration
    #- \( \text{i} = 10 \)
    #- \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \) are shallow copies of \( \text{baseCounts} \).
    #- \( \text{zeros} \) is calculated based on the minimum counts of the current digit and its complement.
    #- If \( \text{mni10} > 0 \), it updates \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \) and increments \( \text{zeros} \).
    #- \( \text{mxZeros} \) is updated if \( \text{mxZeros} < \text{zeros} \).
    #
    ##### After the Second Iteration
    #- \( \text{i} = 9 \)
    #- Similar operations as above, but with updated \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \).
    #
    ##### After the Third Iteration
    #- \( \text{i} = 8 \)
    #- Similar operations as above, but with further updated \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \).
    #
    ##### After the Fourth Iteration
    #- \( \text{i} = 7 \)
    #- Similar operations as above, but with even further updated \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \).
    #
    ##### After the Fifth Iteration
    #- \( \text{i} = 6 \)
    #- Similar operations as above, but with the final updates to \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \).
    #
    #### Final State Analysis
    #After all iterations, the following conditions hold:
    #- \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \) will be the result of decrementing the counts based on the minimum counts of the current digit and its complement.
    #- \( \text{mxZeros} \) will be the maximum number of zeros found during the iterations.
    #- \( \text{mxZString} \) will be the string representation of the maximum zero count configuration.
    #
    #### Determining the Output State
    #Given the operations within the loop and the final conditions, we can summarize the output state as follows:
    #
    #- \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \) will be the remaining counts of each digit after all iterations.
    #- \( \text{mxZeros} \) will be the maximum number of zeros achieved.
    #- \( \text{mxZString} \) will be the string representation of the maximum zero count configuration.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #**Output State: **`i` is 6, `countsa` and `countsb` are arrays where `countsa[d]` and `countsb[d]` are the remaining counts of digit `d` after all iterations, `mxZeros` is the maximum number of zeros achieved, `mxZString` is a list containing two strings representing the maximum zero count configuration, `iTen` is -6, `mxZString[0]` and `mxZString[1]` are the final strings formed based on the remaining counts and the maximum zero count configuration.
    if (mxZeros == 0) :
        return digits, digits
        #The program returns the same values for `countsa` and `countsb` which are arrays where `countsa[d]` and `countsb[d]` are the remaining counts of digit `d` after all iterations, and `mxZeros` which is 0, and `iTen` which is -6
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `i` is 6, `countsa` and `countsb` are arrays where `countsa[d]` and `countsb[d]` are the remaining counts of digit `d` after all iterations, `mxZeros` is the maximum number of zeros achieved, `mxZString` is a list containing two strings representing the maximum zero count configuration, `iTen` is -6, `mxZString[0]` and `mxZString[1]` are the final strings formed based on the remaining counts and the maximum zero count configuration, and `mxZeros` is not equal to 0.
    return tuple(mxZString)
    #The program returns a tuple containing two strings mxZString[0] and mxZString[1] which represent the final strings formed based on the remaining counts and the maximum zero count configuration
