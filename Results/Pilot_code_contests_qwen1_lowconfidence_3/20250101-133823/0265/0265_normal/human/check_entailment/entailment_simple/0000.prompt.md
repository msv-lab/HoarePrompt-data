You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Andrey's favourite number is n. Andrey's friends gave him two identical numbers n as a New Year present. He hung them on a wall and watched them adoringly.

Then Andrey got bored from looking at the same number and he started to swap digits first in one, then in the other number, then again in the first number and so on (arbitrary number of changes could be made in each number). At some point it turned out that if we sum the resulting numbers, then the number of zeroes with which the sum will end would be maximum among the possible variants of digit permutations in those numbers.

Given number n, can you find the two digit permutations that have this property?

Input

The first line contains a positive integer n â€” the original number. The number of digits in this number does not exceed 105. The number is written without any leading zeroes.

Output

Print two permutations of digits of number n, such that the sum of these numbers ends with the maximum number of zeroes. The permutations can have leading zeroes (if they are present, they all should be printed). The permutations do not have to be different. If there are several answers, print any of them.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```

if __name__ == '__main__':
    digits = sys.stdin.readline().strip('\n\r ')
    print('%s\n%s' % func_1(digits))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a string representing a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have executed.
    #
    #### Initial State
    #- \( i \) is 10.
    #- \( \text{digits} \) is a non-empty string representing a positive integer.
    #- \( \text{pair9s} \) is a dictionary mapping each digit to its complement (e.g., {0: 9, 1: 8, ..., 9: 0}).
    #- \( \text{baseCounts} \) is an array where \( \text{baseCounts}[d] \) is the count of digit \( d \) in \( \text{digits} \).
    #- \( \text{itens} \) is -1.
    #- \( \text{mxZeros} \) is 0.
    #
    #### Loop Code Analysis
    #The loop iterates over \( i \) from 1 to 5. For each iteration, it performs several operations including updating the counts, calculating zeros, and potentially updating the maximum zeros count and the corresponding strings.
    #
    #### Iteration Analysis
    ##### After the First Iteration
    #- \( \text{i} = 10 \)
    #- \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \) are shallow copies of \( \text{baseCounts} \).
    #- \( \text{zeros} \) is calculated based on the minimum counts of the current digit and its complement.
    #- If \( \text{mni10} > 0 \), it updates \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \) and increments \( \text{zeros} \).
    #- \( \text{mxZeros} \) is updated if \( \text{mxZeros} < \text{zeros} \).
    #
    ##### After the Second Iteration
    #- \( \text{i} = 9 \)
    #- Similar operations as above, but with updated \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \).
    #
    ##### After the Third Iteration
    #- \( \text{i} = 8 \)
    #- Similar operations as above, but with further updated \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \).
    #
    ##### After the Fourth Iteration
    #- \( \text{i} = 7 \)
    #- Similar operations as above, but with even further updated \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \).
    #
    ##### After the Fifth Iteration
    #- \( \text{i} = 6 \)
    #- Similar operations as above, but with the final updates to \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \).
    #
    #### Final State Analysis
    #After all iterations, the following conditions hold:
    #- \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \) will be the result of decrementing the counts based on the minimum counts of the current digit and its complement.
    #- \( \text{mxZeros} \) will be the maximum number of zeros found during the iterations.
    #- \( \text{mxZString} \) will be the string representation of the maximum zero count configuration.
    #
    #### Determining the Output State
    #Given the operations within the loop and the final conditions, we can summarize the output state as follows:
    #
    #- \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \) will be the remaining counts of each digit after all iterations.
    #- \( \text{mxZeros} \) will be the maximum number of zeros achieved.
    #- \( \text{mxZString} \) will be the string representation of the maximum zero count configuration.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #**Output State: **`i` is 6, `countsa` and `countsb` are arrays where `countsa[d]` and `countsb[d]` are the remaining counts of digit `d` after all iterations, `mxZeros` is the maximum number of zeros achieved, `mxZString` is a list containing two strings representing the maximum zero count configuration, `iTen` is -6, `mxZString[0]` and `mxZString[1]` are the final strings formed based on the remaining counts and the maximum zero count configuration.
    if (mxZeros == 0) :
        return digits, digits
        #The program returns the same values for `countsa` and `countsb` which are arrays where `countsa[d]` and `countsb[d]` are the remaining counts of digit `d` after all iterations, and `mxZeros` which is 0, and `iTen` which is -6
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `i` is 6, `countsa` and `countsb` are arrays where `countsa[d]` and `countsb[d]` are the remaining counts of digit `d` after all iterations, `mxZeros` is the maximum number of zeros achieved, `mxZString` is a list containing two strings representing the maximum zero count configuration, `iTen` is -6, `mxZString[0]` and `mxZString[1]` are the final strings formed based on the remaining counts and the maximum zero count configuration, and `mxZeros` is not equal to 0.
    return tuple(mxZString)
    #The program returns a tuple containing two strings mxZString[0] and mxZString[1] which represent the final strings formed based on the remaining counts and the maximum zero count configuration

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
