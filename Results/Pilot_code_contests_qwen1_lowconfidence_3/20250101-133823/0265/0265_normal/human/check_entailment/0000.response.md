Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to generate two digit permutations of the input number `n` such that their sum ends with the maximum number of trailing zeroes. However, the logic in the `func_1` function has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Digits**: The function does not correctly handle the distribution of digits to achieve the maximum number of trailing zeroes. For instance, it does not ensure that the most significant digits contributing to the sum are paired optimally.

2. **Debugging Statements**: The debug statements inside the function do not contribute to the final result and can be removed. More importantly, they do not help in understanding the logic flow clearly.

3. **Logic Flaws**: The logic for determining the optimal pairings of digits is flawed. For example, the function does not consider the possibility of pairing digits to maximize the trailing zeroes in the sum. Instead, it seems to focus on minimizing the difference between the two numbers, which is not the goal.

A correct approach would involve ensuring that the most significant digits that contribute to the sum are paired to maximize the number of trailing zeroes. This typically involves pairing the largest possible digits together, especially the digit '9', which contributes significantly to trailing zeroes when added to another '1'.

Here is a revised version of the logic that might work correctly:

```python
def func_1(digits):
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Count the frequency of each digit
    digit_count = Counter(digits)
    
    # Sort the digits in descending order
    sorted_digits = sorted(digit_count.items(), key=lambda x: -x[0])
    
    # Initialize the two permutations
    perm1 = []
    perm2 = []
    
    # Pair the digits to maximize trailing zeroes
    for i in range(10):
        count = digit_count[i]
        for _ in range(count):
            if perm1 and perm2 and perm1[-1] + perm2[-1] >= 10:
                perm1.pop()
                perm2.pop()
            if perm1:
                perm1.append(9 - i)
                perm2.append(i)
            else:
                perm1.append(i)
                perm2.append(9 - i)
    
    # Convert lists to strings
    perm1_str = ''.join(map(str, perm1))
    perm2_str = ''.join(map(str, perm2))
    
    return (perm1_str, perm2_str)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    digits = input().strip()
    print(func_1(digits))
```

This approach ensures that the most significant digits are paired optimally to maximize the number of trailing zeroes in the sum. However, the original program does not implement this logic, hence it is incorrect.
