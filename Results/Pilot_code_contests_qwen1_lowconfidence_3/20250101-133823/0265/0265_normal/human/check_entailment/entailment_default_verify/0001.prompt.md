You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Andrey's favourite number is n. Andrey's friends gave him two identical numbers n as a New Year present. He hung them on a wall and watched them adoringly.

Then Andrey got bored from looking at the same number and he started to swap digits first in one, then in the other number, then again in the first number and so on (arbitrary number of changes could be made in each number). At some point it turned out that if we sum the resulting numbers, then the number of zeroes with which the sum will end would be maximum among the possible variants of digit permutations in those numbers.

Given number n, can you find the two digit permutations that have this property?

Input

The first line contains a positive integer n — the original number. The number of digits in this number does not exceed 105. The number is written without any leading zeroes.

Output

Print two permutations of digits of number n, such that the sum of these numbers ends with the maximum number of zeroes. The permutations can have leading zeroes (if they are present, they all should be printed). The permutations do not have to be different. If there are several answers, print any of them.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always produce the correct output as required by the problem description. Specifically, the program logic seems overly complex and may not handle all edge cases properly. Here’s a counterexample to demonstrate:

### Counterexample:
**Input:**
```
500
```

**Expected Output:**
```
500
500
```

**Actual Output:**
The program outputs the permutations but does not necessarily maximize the number of trailing zeros when summed. Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Base Case Analysis**: For `500`, the program should ideally produce `500` and `500` since swapping digits in both numbers to maximize trailing zeros results in no change, and the sum `1000` has three trailing zeros.

2. **Logic Review**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to find permutations that maximize trailing zeros by iteratively reducing certain digit pairs and calculating zeros.
   - However, the logic inside the loop for calculating `zeros` and updating `countsa` and `countsb` might not correctly handle all permutations that lead to the maximum number of trailing zeros.

3. **Potential Issue**:
   - The logic to calculate `zeros` and update the counts seems to focus on specific digit pairs like `i` and `10-i`, but it might miss other optimal configurations.

To confirm, let's run the program with the input `500` and observe the output. The program does not guarantee the correct output for all cases, hence it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a string `digits` which represents a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105. It processes this string through a series of steps involving counting digit occurrences, comparing and decrementing counts based on pairs, and identifying configurations that maximize the number of consecutive zeros. 

The function ultimately determines two possible states upon completion:
1. If no maximum zero count (`mxZeros`) is achieved (i.e., `mxZeros == 0`), the function returns the original `digits` string paired with itself. This indicates that no optimal configuration was found.
2. Otherwise, the function constructs two strings (`mxZString[0]` and `mxZString[1]`) that represent the optimal configuration maximizing the number of consecutive zeros and returns them as a tuple.

Potential edge cases include:
- If the input `digits` contains only one type of digit, the function may not achieve any zeros, leading to the first case where the original `digits` are returned.

Missing functionality noted in the annotations includes:
- The initial state of `iTen` is not explicitly mentioned in the return postconditions, though it is set to -1 before the main loop starts.
- The variable `mxZString` is constructed and printed during the loop but only used in the final return value if `mxZeros` is greater than 0.
- The loop iterates from 1 to 5, meaning that only up to five operations are performed, which might not cover all possible configurations for larger numbers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
