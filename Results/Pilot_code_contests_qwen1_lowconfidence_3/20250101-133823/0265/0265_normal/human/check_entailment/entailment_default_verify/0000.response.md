Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the `func_1` function does not effectively maximize the number of trailing zeroes in the sum of the two permutations. Specifically, the code iterates over a limited range (1 to 5) and attempts to construct permutations by minimizing differences rather than maximizing the number of trailing zeroes. The output hints indicate that the code constructs permutations based on minimizing differences, which is not aligned with the problem's requirement to maximize trailing zeroes in the sum. Therefore, the original assessment of incorrectness is justified.
