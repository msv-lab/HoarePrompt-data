The function `func_1` accepts a string `digits` which represents a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105. It processes this string through a series of steps involving counting digit occurrences, comparing and decrementing counts based on pairs, and identifying configurations that maximize the number of consecutive zeros. 

The function ultimately determines two possible states upon completion:
1. If no maximum zero count (`mxZeros`) is achieved (i.e., `mxZeros == 0`), the function returns the original `digits` string paired with itself. This indicates that no optimal configuration was found.
2. Otherwise, the function constructs two strings (`mxZString[0]` and `mxZString[1]`) that represent the optimal configuration maximizing the number of consecutive zeros and returns them as a tuple.

Potential edge cases include:
- If the input `digits` contains only one type of digit, the function may not achieve any zeros, leading to the first case where the original `digits` are returned.

Missing functionality noted in the annotations includes:
- The initial state of `iTen` is not explicitly mentioned in the return postconditions, though it is set to -1 before the main loop starts.
- The variable `mxZString` is constructed and printed during the loop but only used in the final return value if `mxZeros` is greater than 0.
- The loop iterates from 1 to 5, meaning that only up to five operations are performed, which might not cover all possible configurations for larger numbers.
