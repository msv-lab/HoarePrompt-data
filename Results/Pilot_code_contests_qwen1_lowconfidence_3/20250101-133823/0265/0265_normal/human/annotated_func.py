    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have executed.
    #
    #### Initial State
    #- \( i \) is 10.
    #- \( \text{digits} \) is a non-empty string representing a positive integer.
    #- \( \text{pair9s} \) is a dictionary mapping each digit to its complement (e.g., {0: 9, 1: 8, ..., 9: 0}).
    #- \( \text{baseCounts} \) is an array where \( \text{baseCounts}[d] \) is the count of digit \( d \) in \( \text{digits} \).
    #- \( \text{itens} \) is -1.
    #- \( \text{mxZeros} \) is 0.
    #
    #### Loop Code Analysis
    #The loop iterates over \( i \) from 1 to 5. For each iteration, it performs several operations including updating the counts, calculating zeros, and potentially updating the maximum zeros count and the corresponding strings.
    #
    #### Iteration Analysis
    ##### After the First Iteration
    #- \( \text{i} = 10 \)
    #- \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \) are shallow copies of \( \text{baseCounts} \).
    #- \( \text{zeros} \) is calculated based on the minimum counts of the current digit and its complement.
    #- If \( \text{mni10} > 0 \), it updates \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \) and increments \( \text{zeros} \).
    #- \( \text{mxZeros} \) is updated if \( \text{mxZeros} < \text{zeros} \).
    #
    ##### After the Second Iteration
    #- \( \text{i} = 9 \)
    #- Similar operations as above, but with updated \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \).
    #
    ##### After the Third Iteration
    #- \( \text{i} = 8 \)
    #- Similar operations as above, but with further updated \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \).
    #
    ##### After the Fourth Iteration
    #- \( \text{i} = 7 \)
    #- Similar operations as above, but with even further updated \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \).
    #
    ##### After the Fifth Iteration
    #- \( \text{i} = 6 \)
    #- Similar operations as above, but with the final updates to \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \).
    #
    #### Final State Analysis
    #After all iterations, the following conditions hold:
    #- \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \) will be the result of decrementing the counts based on the minimum counts of the current digit and its complement.
    #- \( \text{mxZeros} \) will be the maximum number of zeros found during the iterations.
    #- \( \text{mxZString} \) will be the string representation of the maximum zero count configuration.
    #
    #### Determining the Output State
    #Given the operations within the loop and the final conditions, we can summarize the output state as follows:
    #
    #- \( \text{countsa} \) and \( \text{countsb} \) will be the remaining counts of each digit after all iterations.
    #- \( \text{mxZeros} \) will be the maximum number of zeros achieved.
    #- \( \text{mxZString} \) will be the string representation of the maximum zero count configuration.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #**Output State: **`i` is 6, `countsa` and `countsb` are arrays where `countsa[d]` and `countsb[d]` are the remaining counts of digit `d` after all iterations, `mxZeros` is the maximum number of zeros achieved, `mxZString` is a list containing two strings representing the maximum zero count configuration, `iTen` is -6, `mxZString[0]` and `mxZString[1]` are the final strings formed based on the remaining counts and the maximum zero count configuration.
    if (mxZeros == 0) :
        return digits, digits
        #The program returns the same values for `countsa` and `countsb` which are arrays where `countsa[d]` and `countsb[d]` are the remaining counts of digit `d` after all iterations, and `mxZeros` which is 0, and `iTen` which is -6
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `i` is 6, `countsa` and `countsb` are arrays where `countsa[d]` and `countsb[d]` are the remaining counts of digit `d` after all iterations, `mxZeros` is the maximum number of zeros achieved, `mxZString` is a list containing two strings representing the maximum zero count configuration, `iTen` is -6, `mxZString[0]` and `mxZString[1]` are the final strings formed based on the remaining counts and the maximum zero count configuration, and `mxZeros` is not equal to 0.
    return tuple(mxZString)
    #The program returns a tuple containing two strings mxZString[0] and mxZString[1] which represent the final strings formed based on the remaining counts and the maximum zero count configuration
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `digits` which represents a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105. It processes this string through a series of steps involving counting digit occurrences, comparing and decrementing counts based on pairs, and identifying configurations that maximize the number of consecutive zeros. 

The function ultimately determines two possible states upon completion:
1. If no maximum zero count (`mxZeros`) is achieved (i.e., `mxZeros == 0`), the function returns the original `digits` string paired with itself. This indicates that no optimal configuration was found.
2. Otherwise, the function constructs two strings (`mxZString[0]` and `mxZString[1]`) that represent the optimal configuration maximizing the number of consecutive zeros and returns them as a tuple.

Potential edge cases include:
- If the input `digits` contains only one type of digit, the function may not achieve any zeros, leading to the first case where the original `digits` are returned.

Missing functionality noted in the annotations includes:
- The initial state of `iTen` is not explicitly mentioned in the return postconditions, though it is set to -1 before the main loop starts.
- The variable `mxZString` is constructed and printed during the loop but only used in the final return value if `mxZeros` is greater than 0.
- The loop iterates from 1 to 5, meaning that only up to five operations are performed, which might not cover all possible configurations for larger numbers.
