The function `func_1()` reads an integer input from standard input (stdin) and returns it. There are no parameters accepted by the function. It handles the case where the input from stdin is not an integer by returning the integer value. If the input is not a valid integer, an exception will occur, but the function does not explicitly handle such exceptions.
