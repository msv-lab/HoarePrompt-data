The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and reads a single line of input from `sys.stdin`. It then splits the line into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integer values. The function handles the case where the input line might be empty or contain no valid integers, although it does not explicitly handle such cases in the returned map.
