#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables' values are described in the provided function signature. The function does not take any parameters and its purpose seems to read an integer input from stdin, which is not directly related to the problem description.
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline())
    #The program reads an integer input from stdin and returns it
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1()` reads an integer input from standard input (stdin) and returns it. There are no parameters accepted by the function. It handles the case where the input from stdin is not an integer by returning the integer value. If the input is not a valid integer, an exception will occur, but the function does not explicitly handle such exceptions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables (n, R, C) are mentioned in the provided function signature, and the function does not take any input parameters.
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    #The program returns an object representing a map of integer conversion of the split input from sys.stdin.readline()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and reads a single line of input from `sys.stdin`. It then splits the line into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integer values. The function handles the case where the input line might be empty or contain no valid integers, although it does not explicitly handle such cases in the returned map.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no relevant information about the variables in the function signature for this problem. The function `func_3` does not take any parameters and its purpose seems unrelated to the described problem. The problem description and the given function do not match.
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline()
    #The program returns a string read from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()`
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and reads a single line of text from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()`. The function returns this line of text as a string. This means that after the function concludes, the program will have obtained a line of input from the user, which can be used for further processing within the calling context. Potential edge cases include the user entering an empty line or reaching the end of the input stream. If the user enters nothing and presses enter, the returned string will be an empty string. If the input stream is exhausted, `sys.stdin.readline()` will return an empty string as well.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 300. The function does not use the value of n or any other argument provided to it. Instead, it seems to be part of the output formatting to print groups of labs. However, the actual logic for dividing labs into groups and calculating the minimal number of the sum of units of water that can be transported between groups is not implemented in this function.
def func_4():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a non-empty list, `s` is undefined
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` accepts a non-empty list `args` as input and prints each element of `args` followed by a space. After the loop, it writes a newline character to the standard output. Since no parameters are required according to the annotations, the function might have been intended to take a parameter, but currently, it does not utilize any parameters provided. There is a potential missing functionality where the function should implement the logic for dividing labs into groups and calculating the minimal number of the sum of units of water that can be transported between groups, as indicated by the comment. However, since this logic is not present in the code, the function only performs basic output formatting.
