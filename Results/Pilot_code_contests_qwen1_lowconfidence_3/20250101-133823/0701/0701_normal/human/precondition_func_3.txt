n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 300. The function does not use the value of n or any other argument provided to it. Instead, it seems to be part of the output formatting to print groups of labs. However, the actual logic for dividing labs into groups and calculating the minimal number of the sum of units of water that can be transported between groups is not implemented in this function.
