Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not contain any implementation logic for solving the given problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are defined but do not perform any operations related to the problem description. Specifically, the task requires dividing labs into n groups such that the minimum value of `f(A, B)` is maximized, but the code does not contain any logic to achieve this division.

Given the complexity of the problem, a solution would typically involve generating the groups and calculating the values of `f(A, B)` for each pair of groups. However, the current code does not provide any such implementation. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and hence is incorrect.
