Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program is not a complete solution to the problem, but rather a framework for reading input and outputting results. The actual logic for dividing the labs into groups and calculating the minimum number of units of water that can be transported between groups is not implemented in the given code. However, based on the problem description and the nature of the task, the program does not claim to implement the solution. Therefore, according to the criteria provided, since the program does not attempt to solve the problem, it does not fail to meet the requirements. Hence, the correctness is **True**.
