Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for dividing the labs into \( n \) groups such that the minimal value of \( f(A, B) \) is maximized. Here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Reading Input**: The function `func_1()` reads an integer \( n \) from standard input, which is the number of groups and the number of labs per group. This matches the problem description.

2. **Generating Groups**: The while loop and the nested for loops in the main part of the program generate \( n \) groups, each containing \( n \) labs. The groups are formed such that the labs are distributed in a way that ensures the minimal \( f(A, B) \) value is maximized. Specifically, the labs are assigned to groups in a way that balances the distribution, which aligns with the optimal strategy described in the problem statement.

3. **Outputting Results**: The function `func_4()` writes the groups to the standard output, formatted as required. Each group is printed on a new line with labs separated by spaces.

Given these observations, the annotated version of the code shows that the program correctly implements the required functionality. The original assessment was based on the initial understanding that the code did not contain any relevant logic, but upon reviewing the annotated version, it becomes clear that the logic for dividing the labs into groups is present and correct. Therefore, the original assessment needs to be revised, and the program is indeed correct.
