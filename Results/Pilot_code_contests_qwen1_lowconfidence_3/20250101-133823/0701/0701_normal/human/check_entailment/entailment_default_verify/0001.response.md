Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code defines several utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`) but does not include any logic to solve the problem described. The task requires dividing labs into n groups such that the minimum value of `f(A, B)` is maximized. However, none of the functions defined in the code address this requirement. The function `func_4` only handles basic output formatting and does not implement the necessary logic for solving the problem. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
