Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the program is correct because it does not claim to solve the problem and thus does not fail to meet the requirements. However, based on the problem description and the output hints, it is clear that the program is intended to implement the logic for dividing the labs into groups and calculating the minimal number of units of water that can be transported between groups. The current implementation of `func_4()` only handles basic output formatting and does not perform the required calculations or group division. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and the output hints indicate that the program lacks the necessary functionality to solve the problem.
