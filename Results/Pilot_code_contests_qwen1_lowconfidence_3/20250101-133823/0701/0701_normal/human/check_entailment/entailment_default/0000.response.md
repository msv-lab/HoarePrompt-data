Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the logic for dividing the labs into groups to maximize the minimal number of units of water that can be transported from one group to another. Instead, it simply divides the labs into \( n \times n \) groups in a straightforward manner without considering the objective of maximizing the minimal sum of units of water transportation between groups.

The function `func_1` reads the input \( n \), but the subsequent code does not perform any calculations or logic related to the problem description. It merely initializes and prints groups of labs in a fixed pattern without ensuring that the minimal transportation value \( \min f(A, B) \) is maximized.

Given the problem's requirement to maximize \( \min f(A, B) \), the current implementation does not address this constraint and thus cannot be considered correct.
