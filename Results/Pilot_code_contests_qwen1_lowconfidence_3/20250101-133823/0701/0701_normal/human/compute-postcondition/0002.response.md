According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop iterates over each element in `args`. At the end of the previous iteration, `args` is a non-empty list.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. Since `args` is a non-empty list, it means there are elements in `args`.
2. In the current iteration, `s` has taken one element from `args`.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still contain at least one element.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `args` must still be a non-empty list (it should contain at least one element).

Since `s` represents the current element being processed, it does not need to be explicitly mentioned as it will take the next element from `args` in the next iteration.

State: **`args` is a non-empty list**
