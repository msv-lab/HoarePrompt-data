`sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')` writes the string representation of `s` followed by a space to the standard output. However, since `s` is undefined in the initial state, attempting to call `str(s)` will raise a `NameError`. The standard output is affected but no variable values change directly due to this error.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty list that must have at least two elements, `s` is undefined, an error occurs (NameError)**
