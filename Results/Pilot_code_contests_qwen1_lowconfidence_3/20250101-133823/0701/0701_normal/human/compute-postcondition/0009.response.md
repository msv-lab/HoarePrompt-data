Functionality: **The function `func_4()` accepts a non-empty list `args` as input and prints each element of `args` followed by a space. After the loop, it writes a newline character to the standard output. Since no parameters are required according to the annotations, the function might have been intended to take a parameter, but currently, it does not utilize any parameters provided. There is a potential missing functionality where the function should implement the logic for dividing labs into groups and calculating the minimal number of the sum of units of water that can be transported between groups, as indicated by the comment. However, since this logic is not present in the code, the function only performs basic output formatting.**

Edge Cases:
- If `args` is an empty list, the function will still attempt to iterate over it, which will result in no output being written to the standard output except for the newline character at the end.
- If `args` contains non-string elements, the function will convert them to strings before writing them to the standard output.
