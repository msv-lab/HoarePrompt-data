Output State: **`args` is a non-empty list, `s` is undefined**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: The variable `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 300\). However, the loop itself does not use `n` or any other argument except for `args`.
- **Loop Code**: The loop iterates over each element in `args` and writes each element followed by a space to `sys.stdout`. The variable `s` is used to represent each element in `args`.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **First Iteration**:
   - The loop starts with the first element of `args` and writes it to `sys.stdout`.
   - At the end of the first iteration, `s` would have contained the first element of `args`, but since the loop continues to write `s` (which is undefined at this point), we know that `s` remains undefined after the loop.
   - `args` must be a non-empty list because if it were empty, the loop would not execute even once.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - The loop now processes the second element of `args`.
   - Similarly, `s` would have contained the second element of `args`, but since the loop continues to write `s` (which is undefined at this point), `s` remains undefined after the loop.
   - `args` must now be a non-empty list with at least two elements.

3. **Third Iteration and Beyond**:
   - The loop continues to process each subsequent element of `args`.
   - `s` would contain the respective element being processed during each iteration, but since the loop continues to write `s` (which is undefined at the end of each iteration), `s` remains undefined after the loop.
   - `args` must be a non-empty list with at least as many elements as the number of iterations performed.

4. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `args` will be a non-empty list, and `s` will remain undefined since the loop does not assign a new value to `s` at the end of the loop.

Since the loop does not modify `args` or `s` beyond writing them to `sys.stdout`, the final state of these variables after all iterations will be the same as their state at the end of the last iteration.

### Conclusion:
The output state of the loop after all iterations is that `args` is a non-empty list, and `s` is undefined.
