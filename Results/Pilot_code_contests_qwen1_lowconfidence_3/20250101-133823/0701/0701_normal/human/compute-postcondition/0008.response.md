The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to print groups of labs but does not implement the logic for dividing labs into groups or calculating the minimal number of the sum of units of water that can be transported between groups. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to perform no operation other than potentially being part of a larger system that handles lab groupings and water transport calculations.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and performs no operation.**
