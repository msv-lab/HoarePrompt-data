The code `sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')` does not affect the value of `args`. It writes the string representation of `s` followed by a space to the standard output (stdout). However, since `s` is not defined in the initial state and no assignment to `s` is made within the given code snippet, `s` remains undefined.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty list, `s` is undefined**
