Functionality: The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and reads a single line of text from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()`. The function returns this line of text as a string. This means that after the function concludes, the program will have obtained a line of input from the user, which can be used for further processing within the calling context. Potential edge cases include the user entering an empty line or reaching the end of the input stream. If the user enters nothing and presses enter, the returned string will be an empty string. If the input stream is exhausted, `sys.stdin.readline()` will return an empty string as well.
