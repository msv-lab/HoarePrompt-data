The function `func_5` accepts an integer `n`, which represents the number of intervals within a specified time period during which Vasya can descend to the subway and choose which girlfriend to visit. It then calculates and returns the value of \( \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \). This calculation corresponds to the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The function does not handle any edge cases such as non-integer inputs or negative values for `n`. If `n` is less than zero, the returned value would still be calculated based on the given formula, potentially resulting in a non-physical result since `n` should represent a count of intervals.
