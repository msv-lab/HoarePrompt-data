The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where `a â‰  b`), and returns the value of `a * b / func_1(a, b)`. The function does not modify any external variables and only uses the inputs `a` and `b` to compute the result based on the given relationship. There are no additional actions or side effects beyond this computation.
