Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_6` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the GCD (`G`) and the least common multiple (`L`) of `a` and `b`, and then determines which girlfriend Vasya will visit more frequently based on the intervals between train arrivals. The logic in `func_6` accounts for all potential cases, including when `a < b` and when `a > b`, and correctly returns "Dasha", "Masha", or "Equal" based on the conditions provided. The output hints for each function support this implementation, and the code aligns with the problem description for every potential case.
