You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya the programmer lives in the middle of the Programming subway branch. He has two girlfriends: Dasha and Masha, who live at the different ends of the branch, each one is unaware of the other one's existence.

When Vasya has some free time, he goes to one of his girlfriends. He descends into the subway at some time, waits the first train to come and rides on it to the end of the branch to the corresponding girl. However, the trains run with different frequencies: a train goes to Dasha's direction every a minutes, but a train goes to Masha's direction every b minutes. If two trains approach at the same time, Vasya goes toward the direction with the lower frequency of going trains, that is, to the girl, to whose directions the trains go less frequently (see the note to the third sample).

We know that the trains begin to go simultaneously before Vasya appears. That is the train schedule is such that there exists a moment of time when the two trains arrive simultaneously.

Help Vasya count to which girlfriend he will go more often.

Input

The first line contains two integers a and b (a ≠ b, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 106).

Output

Print "Dasha" if Vasya will go to Dasha more frequently, "Masha" if he will go to Masha more frequently, or "Equal" if he will go to both girlfriends with the same frequency.

Examples

Input

3 7


Output

Dasha


Input

5 3


Output

Masha


Input

2 3


Output

Equal

Note

Let's take a look at the third sample. Let the trains start to go at the zero moment of time. It is clear that the moments of the trains' arrival will be periodic with period 6. That's why it is enough to show that if Vasya descends to the subway at a moment of time inside the interval (0, 6], he will go to both girls equally often. 

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 0 to 2, he leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the second minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 2 to 3, he leaves for Masha on the train that arrives by the third minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 3 to 4, he leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the fourth minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 4 to 6, he waits for both trains to arrive by the sixth minute and goes to Masha as trains go less often in Masha's direction.

In sum Masha and Dasha get equal time — three minutes for each one, thus, Vasya will go to both girlfriends equally often.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

        D = L - M

        else:
            return Da


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_6` is not correctly determining to which girlfriend Vasya will go more often based on the given conditions.

Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of GCD and LCM**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) respectively. However, these functions are not used correctly in the context of the problem.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_6`**:
   - The logic in `func_6` does not correctly handle the intervals during which Vasya would choose to go to either girlfriend.
   - The conditions for choosing between Dasha and Masha based on the intervals are not implemented correctly.

To illustrate the issue, let's consider the following test case:

### Test Case:
- Input: `a = 3`, `b = 7`

### Expected Output:
- According to the problem statement, since the trains to Dasha come every 3 minutes and to Masha every 7 minutes, Vasya will go to Dasha more often because 3 < 7.

### Actual Output:
- Running the provided code will likely result in an incorrect output because the logic in `func_6` is flawed.

To fix this, we need to correctly implement the logic to determine the intervals and the frequency of visits to each girlfriend. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def more_frequent_girlfriend(a, b):
    lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
    count_dasha = (lcm_ab // a) - 1
    count_masha = (lcm_ab // b) - 1
    
    if count_dasha > count_masha:
        return "Dasha"
    elif count_masha > count_dasha:
        return "Masha"
    else:
        return "Equal"

# Example usage
a = 3
b = 7
print(more_frequent_girlfriend(a, b))
```

This corrected version correctly implements the logic to determine which girlfriend Vasya will visit more often based on the given intervals.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin
output = sys.stdout
MAX = 10 ** 6
Da = 'Dasha'
Ma = 'Masha'
S = input.readline().split(' ')
a = int(S[0])
b = int(S[1])
assert 1 <= a and a <= MAX
assert 1 <= b and b <= MAX
assert a != b
answer = func_6(a, b)
output.write('%s\n' % answer)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers where a ≠ b and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns `a`, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, where `a ≠ b` and both are within the range [1, 10^6]. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. After executing the algorithm, it returns `a`, which is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and sets `b` to 0. This process handles all valid inputs within the specified range, ensuring that the GCD is correctly calculated and `b` is reset to 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers where a ≠ b, and a * b / func_1(a, b) equals a / func_1(a, b) * b.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a / func_1(a, b) * b
    #`a * b / func_1(a, b)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where `a ≠ b`), and returns the value of `a * b / func_1(a, b)`. The function does not modify any external variables and only uses the inputs `a` and `b` to compute the result based on the given relationship. There are no additional actions or side effects beyond this computation.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of two positive integers [a, b] where a ≠ b and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6.
def func_3(numbers):
    return reduce(lambda a, b: func_1(a, b), numbers)
    #The program returns the result of applying the function `func_1` to the two elements of the list `numbers` using the `reduce` function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list containing exactly two positive integers `[a, b]` where `a ≠ b` and `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6`. It returns the result of applying the function `func_1` to these two integers using the `reduce` function. Since the list always contains exactly two elements, the `reduce` function applies `func_1` once, passing the first element to `func_1` as the initial accumulator value and the second element as the first argument. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling. The function ensures that the input list always contains exactly two elements and that they are distinct positive integers within the specified range.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **numbers is a list of integers containing at least two elements, and the function func_2 is defined elsewhere in the code to handle the comparison or processing of two integers.
def func_4(numbers):
    return reduce(lambda a, b: func_2(a, b), numbers)
    #The program returns the result of applying the function `func_2` to all pairs of integers in the list `numbers` using the `reduce` function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers containing at least two elements. It then applies the function `func_2` to all pairs of integers in the list using the `reduce` function. The `reduce` function iteratively applies `func_2` to the accumulated result and the next element in the list, starting with the first element. The final result is the cumulative application of `func_2` across all pairs in the list. This process ensures that every pair of integers in the list is processed exactly once. The function returns the final result of this reduction. Potential edge cases include empty lists or lists with only one element, although the function is specified to accept at least two elements. If the list has only one element, the function would still return that element, as there are no pairs to process.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of intervals within the time period during which Vasya can descend to the subway and choose which girlfriend to visit.
def func_5(n):
    return n * (n + 1) / 2
    #The program returns the value of n*(n+1)/2, where n is an integer representing the number of intervals within the time period during which Vasya can descend to the subway and choose which girlfriend to visit
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts an integer `n`, which represents the number of intervals within a specified time period during which Vasya can descend to the subway and choose which girlfriend to visit. It then calculates and returns the value of \( \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \). This calculation corresponds to the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The function does not handle any edge cases such as non-integer inputs or negative values for `n`. If `n` is less than zero, the returned value would still be calculated based on the given formula, potentially resulting in a non-physical result since `n` should represent a count of intervals.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the frequency of trains going to Masha's and Dasha's directions respectively, with a ≠ b.
def func_6(a, b):
    G = func_1(a, b)
    L = func_2(a, b)
    if (a < b) :
        M = (L / b - 1) * G
        D = L - M
        if (D > M) :
            return Ma
            #The program returns M, which is calculated as \(\left(\frac{L}{b} - 1\right) \times G\)
        else :
            return Da
            #The program returns \(D \times a\), where \(D = L + G - \frac{L \times G}{b}\) and \(M = \left(\frac{L}{b} - 1\right) \times G\) with the condition \(D \leq M\)
    else :
        M = (L / a - 1) * G
        D = L - M
        if (D > M) :
            return Ma
            #The program returns M*a, where M is ((L / a) - 1) * G and L is the result of func_2(a, b)
        else :
            return Da
            #The program returns D*a, where D is L - M and M is ((L / a) - 1) * G, and D is less than or equal to M
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers representing frequencies of trains going to Masha's and Dasha's directions respectively, with `a ≠ b`. It calculates values `G`, `L`, `M`, and `D` based on the inputs and certain conditions. Finally, it returns one of four possible results:
1. \(M\), which is calculated as \(\left(\frac{L}{b} - 1\right) \times G\).
2. \(D \times a\), where \(D = L + G - \frac{L \times G}{b}\) and \(M = \left(\frac{L}{b} - 1\right) \times G\) with the condition \(D \leq M\).
3. \(M \times a\), where \(M\) is \(((L / a) - 1) \times G\).
4. \(D \times a\), where \(D\) is \(L - M\) and \(M\) is \(((L / a) - 1) \times G\), and \(D \leq M\).

The function covers all potential cases based on the conditions provided and ensures that the correct value is returned according to the specified rules.
