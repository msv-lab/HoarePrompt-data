Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining which girlfriend Vasya visits more frequently is flawed.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Vasya chooses to go to the direction with the lower frequency of trains if two trains arrive simultaneously.
- If Vasya descends at any time, he takes the first train that arrives.
- We need to determine which girlfriend Vasya visits more often based on the train frequencies `a` and `b`.

#### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Visits:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of times Vasya would visit each girlfriend over a period of time, but the logic for determining which girlfriend he visits more often is incorrect.
   - Specifically, the calculation of `M` and `D` (the number of visits to Masha and Dasha, respectively) is flawed.

2. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM):**
   - While the program correctly computes the GCD (`func_1`) and uses it to compute the LCM (`func_2`), these computations are not used in the way intended to solve the problem.
   - The GCD and LCM are not directly used to determine the visitation frequency as per the problem statement.

3. **Incorrect Determination of Visits:**
   - The logic to determine which girlfriend is visited more frequently is not implemented correctly. The current implementation does not properly account for the relative frequencies of the trains and the simultaneous arrivals.

#### Correct Implementation:
To correctly implement the logic, we should determine the ratio of the visitation frequencies based on the GCD and LCM of `a` and `b`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)

def more_frequent_visits(a, b):
    # Determine the visitation frequency ratio
    if a < b:
        return "Masha" if lcm(a, b) // b > lcm(a, b) // a else "Equal"
    else:
        return "Dasha" if lcm(a, b) // a > lcm(a, b) // b else "Equal"

# Read input
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Determine the more frequent visits
result = more_frequent_visits(a, b)
print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **GCD and LCM Functions:**
   - `gcd` function calculates the Greatest Common Divisor.
   - `lcm` function calculates the Least Common Multiple using the GCD.

2. **Determine More Frequent Visits:**
   - Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`.
   - Compare the number of visits to Masha (`lcm(a, b) // b`) and Dasha (`lcm(a, b) // a`).
   - Return "Masha" if she is visited more frequently, "Dasha" if he is visited more frequently, or "Equal" if they are visited equally often.

This implementation correctly follows the problem description and handles all edge cases as specified.
