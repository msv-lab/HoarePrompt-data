Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually implement the logic required to determine to which girlfriend Vasya will go more often. Instead, it contains several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) that do not seem to be used in the context of solving the problem. The final function `func_6` attempts to compare the frequencies, but it does not correctly handle the logic described in the problem statement.

Specifically, `func_6` does not correctly implement the logic for determining which girlfriend Vasya will visit more often based on the train schedules. It seems to be attempting to calculate something related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM), but it does not correctly implement the logic for comparing the frequencies of the trains.

For example, consider the case where `a = 3` and `b = 5`. According to the problem description, Vasya should go to Dasha more often because the trains to Dasha's direction come more frequently. However, the current implementation would not correctly handle this case, leading to an incorrect result.
