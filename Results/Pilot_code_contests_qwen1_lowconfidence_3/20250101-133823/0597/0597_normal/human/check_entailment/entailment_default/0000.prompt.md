You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya the programmer lives in the middle of the Programming subway branch. He has two girlfriends: Dasha and Masha, who live at the different ends of the branch, each one is unaware of the other one's existence.

When Vasya has some free time, he goes to one of his girlfriends. He descends into the subway at some time, waits the first train to come and rides on it to the end of the branch to the corresponding girl. However, the trains run with different frequencies: a train goes to Dasha's direction every a minutes, but a train goes to Masha's direction every b minutes. If two trains approach at the same time, Vasya goes toward the direction with the lower frequency of going trains, that is, to the girl, to whose directions the trains go less frequently (see the note to the third sample).

We know that the trains begin to go simultaneously before Vasya appears. That is the train schedule is such that there exists a moment of time when the two trains arrive simultaneously.

Help Vasya count to which girlfriend he will go more often.

Input

The first line contains two integers a and b (a ≠ b, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 106).

Output

Print "Dasha" if Vasya will go to Dasha more frequently, "Masha" if he will go to Masha more frequently, or "Equal" if he will go to both girlfriends with the same frequency.

Examples

Input

3 7


Output

Dasha


Input

5 3


Output

Masha


Input

2 3


Output

Equal

Note

Let's take a look at the third sample. Let the trains start to go at the zero moment of time. It is clear that the moments of the trains' arrival will be periodic with period 6. That's why it is enough to show that if Vasya descends to the subway at a moment of time inside the interval (0, 6], he will go to both girls equally often. 

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 0 to 2, he leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the second minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 2 to 3, he leaves for Masha on the train that arrives by the third minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 3 to 4, he leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the fourth minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 4 to 6, he waits for both trains to arrive by the sixth minute and goes to Masha as trains go less often in Masha's direction.

In sum Masha and Dasha get equal time — three minutes for each one, thus, Vasya will go to both girlfriends equally often.
Functions with output description for each function:
import sys

input = sys.stdin
output = sys.stdout
MAX = 10 ** 6
Da = 'Dasha'
Ma = 'Masha'
S = input.readline().split(' ')
a = int(S[0])
b = int(S[1])
assert 1 <= a and a <= MAX
assert 1 <= b and b <= MAX
assert a != b
answer = func_6(a, b)
output.write('%s\n' % answer)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, where `a ≠ b` and both are within the range [1, 10^6]. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. After executing the algorithm, it returns `a`, which is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and sets `b` to 0. This process handles all valid inputs within the specified range, ensuring that the GCD is correctly calculated and `b` is reset to 0.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(a, b):
    assert a * b / func_1(a, b) == a / func_1(a, b) * b
    return a / func_1(a, b) * b
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where `a ≠ b`), and returns the value of `a * b / func_1(a, b)`. The function does not modify any external variables and only uses the inputs `a` and `b` to compute the result based on the given relationship. There are no additional actions or side effects beyond this computation.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(numbers):
    return reduce(lambda a, b: func_1(a, b), numbers)
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list containing exactly two positive integers `[a, b]` where `a ≠ b` and `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6`. It returns the result of applying the function `func_1` to these two integers using the `reduce` function. Since the list always contains exactly two elements, the `reduce` function applies `func_1` once, passing the first element to `func_1` as the initial accumulator value and the second element as the first argument. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling. The function ensures that the input list always contains exactly two elements and that they are distinct positive integers within the specified range.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(numbers):
    return reduce(lambda a, b: func_2(a, b), numbers)
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers containing at least two elements. It then applies the function `func_2` to all pairs of integers in the list using the `reduce` function. The `reduce` function iteratively applies `func_2` to the accumulated result and the next element in the list, starting with the first element. The final result is the cumulative application of `func_2` across all pairs in the list. This process ensures that every pair of integers in the list is processed exactly once. The function returns the final result of this reduction. Potential edge cases include empty lists or lists with only one element, although the function is specified to accept at least two elements. If the list has only one element, the function would still return that element, as there are no pairs to process.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(n):
    return n * (n + 1) / 2
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts an integer `n`, which represents the number of intervals within a specified time period during which Vasya can descend to the subway and choose which girlfriend to visit. It then calculates and returns the value of \( \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \). This calculation corresponds to the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The function does not handle any edge cases such as non-integer inputs or negative values for `n`. If `n` is less than zero, the returned value would still be calculated based on the given formula, potentially resulting in a non-physical result since `n` should represent a count of intervals.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(a, b):
    G = func_1(a, b)
    L = func_2(a, b)
    if a < b:
        M = (L / b - 1) * G
        D = L - M
        if D > M:
            return Ma
        else:
            return Da
    else:
        M = (L / a - 1) * G
        D = L - M
        if D > M:
            return Ma
        else:
            return Da
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers representing frequencies of trains going to Masha's and Dasha's directions respectively, with `a ≠ b`. It calculates values `G`, `L`, `M`, and `D` based on the inputs and certain conditions. Finally, it returns one of four possible results:
1. \(M\), which is calculated as \(\left(\frac{L}{b} - 1\right) \times G\).
2. \(D \times a\), where \(D = L + G - \frac{L \times G}{b}\) and \(M = \left(\frac{L}{b} - 1\right) \times G\) with the condition \(D \leq M\).
3. \(M \times a\), where \(M\) is \(((L / a) - 1) \times G\).
4. \(D \times a\), where \(D\) is \(L - M\) and \(M\) is \(((L / a) - 1) \times G\), and \(D \leq M\).

The function covers all potential cases based on the conditions provided and ensures that the correct value is returned according to the specified rules.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
