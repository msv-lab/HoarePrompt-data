Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_6` does not correctly implement the logic to determine which girlfriend Vasya will visit more frequently based on the given problem description. Specifically, the logic used in `func_6` does not align with the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

According to the problem description, Vasya will choose the direction of the train that has the lower frequency. However, the logic in `func_6` seems to be overly complex and does not directly compare the frequencies of the trains going to each girlfriend's direction.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:

- Input: `a = 3`, `b = 7`
- Expected output: `Dasha`

Based on the problem description, since the train frequency to Dasha's direction is 3, and the train frequency to Masha's direction is 7, Vasya should visit Dasha more frequently because the trains to Dasha's direction come more often.

However, the current implementation in `func_6` does not directly reflect this logic. Instead, it calculates some intermediate values (`G`, `L`, `M`, and `D`) and compares them without clearly addressing the core requirement of choosing the direction with the higher frequency.

Given the complexity and lack of direct frequency comparison in the current implementation, it is clear that the function does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
