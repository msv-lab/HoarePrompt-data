Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_6` is not correctly determining to which girlfriend Vasya will go more often based on the given conditions.

Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of GCD and LCM**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) respectively. However, these functions are not used correctly in the context of the problem.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_6`**:
   - The logic in `func_6` does not correctly handle the intervals during which Vasya would choose to go to either girlfriend.
   - The conditions for choosing between Dasha and Masha based on the intervals are not implemented correctly.

To illustrate the issue, let's consider the following test case:

### Test Case:
- Input: `a = 3`, `b = 7`

### Expected Output:
- According to the problem statement, since the trains to Dasha come every 3 minutes and to Masha every 7 minutes, Vasya will go to Dasha more often because 3 < 7.

### Actual Output:
- Running the provided code will likely result in an incorrect output because the logic in `func_6` is flawed.

To fix this, we need to correctly implement the logic to determine the intervals and the frequency of visits to each girlfriend. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def more_frequent_girlfriend(a, b):
    lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
    count_dasha = (lcm_ab // a) - 1
    count_masha = (lcm_ab // b) - 1
    
    if count_dasha > count_masha:
        return "Dasha"
    elif count_masha > count_dasha:
        return "Masha"
    else:
        return "Equal"

# Example usage
a = 3
b = 7
print(more_frequent_girlfriend(a, b))
```

This corrected version correctly implements the logic to determine which girlfriend Vasya will visit more often based on the given intervals.
