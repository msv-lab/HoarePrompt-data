Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the input frequencies `a` and `b` are not relatively prime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is not 1). Specifically, the function `func_6` relies on the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) to determine the frequency with which Vasya visits each girlfriend. However, the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to calculate the GCD and LCM, respectively, under the assumption that the inputs are relatively prime. When `a` and `b` are not relatively prime, the calculations may not accurately reflect the actual behavior of the trains and Vasya's visits.

For example, consider the input `a = 6` and `b = 9`. In this case, the GCD of `6` and `9` is `3`. The function `func_2` calculates the LCM of `6` and `9` as `18`, which is correct. However, the behavior of the trains changes because they now share a common factor of `3`. The LCM of `6` and `9` is `18`, meaning trains from both directions will coincide every `18` minutes. According to the problem description, when two trains arrive at the same time, Vasya chooses the direction with fewer trains, which means he would prefer Dasha's direction over Masha's due to the lower frequency.

However, the current implementation in `func_6` does not account for this behavior properly. It assumes that the LCM is the point of overlap without considering the reduced frequency due to the GCD. Therefore, the program may incorrectly determine the frequency with which Vasya visits each girlfriend.

To fix this, the program needs to adjust its logic to correctly handle the GCD and LCM when `a` and `b` are not relatively prime. Specifically, the logic should take into account the reduced frequency due to the shared GCD when determining the number of times Vasya visits each girlfriend.
