#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers where a ≠ b and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns `a`, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, where `a ≠ b` and both are within the range [1, 10^6]. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. After executing the algorithm, it returns `a`, which is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and sets `b` to 0. This process handles all valid inputs within the specified range, ensuring that the GCD is correctly calculated and `b` is reset to 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers where a ≠ b, and a * b / func_1(a, b) equals a / func_1(a, b) * b.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a / func_1(a, b) * b
    #`a * b / func_1(a, b)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where `a ≠ b`), and returns the value of `a * b / func_1(a, b)`. The function does not modify any external variables and only uses the inputs `a` and `b` to compute the result based on the given relationship. There are no additional actions or side effects beyond this computation.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of two positive integers [a, b] where a ≠ b and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6.
def func_3(numbers):
    return reduce(lambda a, b: func_1(a, b), numbers)
    #The program returns the result of applying the function `func_1` to the two elements of the list `numbers` using the `reduce` function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list containing exactly two positive integers `[a, b]` where `a ≠ b` and `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6`. It returns the result of applying the function `func_1` to these two integers using the `reduce` function. Since the list always contains exactly two elements, the `reduce` function applies `func_1` once, passing the first element to `func_1` as the initial accumulator value and the second element as the first argument. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling. The function ensures that the input list always contains exactly two elements and that they are distinct positive integers within the specified range.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **numbers is a list of integers containing at least two elements, and the function func_2 is defined elsewhere in the code to handle the comparison or processing of two integers.
def func_4(numbers):
    return reduce(lambda a, b: func_2(a, b), numbers)
    #The program returns the result of applying the function `func_2` to all pairs of integers in the list `numbers` using the `reduce` function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers containing at least two elements. It then applies the function `func_2` to all pairs of integers in the list using the `reduce` function. The `reduce` function iteratively applies `func_2` to the accumulated result and the next element in the list, starting with the first element. The final result is the cumulative application of `func_2` across all pairs in the list. This process ensures that every pair of integers in the list is processed exactly once. The function returns the final result of this reduction. Potential edge cases include empty lists or lists with only one element, although the function is specified to accept at least two elements. If the list has only one element, the function would still return that element, as there are no pairs to process.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of intervals within the time period during which Vasya can descend to the subway and choose which girlfriend to visit.
def func_5(n):
    return n * (n + 1) / 2
    #The program returns the value of n*(n+1)/2, where n is an integer representing the number of intervals within the time period during which Vasya can descend to the subway and choose which girlfriend to visit
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts an integer `n`, which represents the number of intervals within a specified time period during which Vasya can descend to the subway and choose which girlfriend to visit. It then calculates and returns the value of \( \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \). This calculation corresponds to the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The function does not handle any edge cases such as non-integer inputs or negative values for `n`. If `n` is less than zero, the returned value would still be calculated based on the given formula, potentially resulting in a non-physical result since `n` should represent a count of intervals.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the frequency of trains going to Masha's and Dasha's directions respectively, with a ≠ b.
def func_6(a, b):
    G = func_1(a, b)
    L = func_2(a, b)
    if (a < b) :
        M = (L / b - 1) * G
        D = L - M
        if (D > M) :
            return Ma
            #The program returns M, which is calculated as \(\left(\frac{L}{b} - 1\right) \times G\)
        else :
            return Da
            #The program returns \(D \times a\), where \(D = L + G - \frac{L \times G}{b}\) and \(M = \left(\frac{L}{b} - 1\right) \times G\) with the condition \(D \leq M\)
    else :
        M = (L / a - 1) * G
        D = L - M
        if (D > M) :
            return Ma
            #The program returns M*a, where M is ((L / a) - 1) * G and L is the result of func_2(a, b)
        else :
            return Da
            #The program returns D*a, where D is L - M and M is ((L / a) - 1) * G, and D is less than or equal to M
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers representing frequencies of trains going to Masha's and Dasha's directions respectively, with `a ≠ b`. It calculates values `G`, `L`, `M`, and `D` based on the inputs and certain conditions. Finally, it returns one of four possible results:
1. \(M\), which is calculated as \(\left(\frac{L}{b} - 1\right) \times G\).
2. \(D \times a\), where \(D = L + G - \frac{L \times G}{b}\) and \(M = \left(\frac{L}{b} - 1\right) \times G\) with the condition \(D \leq M\).
3. \(M \times a\), where \(M\) is \(((L / a) - 1) \times G\).
4. \(D \times a\), where \(D\) is \(L - M\) and \(M\) is \(((L / a) - 1) \times G\), and \(D \leq M\).

The function covers all potential cases based on the conditions provided and ensures that the correct value is returned according to the specified rules.
