The code `G = func_1(a, b)` assigns the result of calling the function `func_1` with arguments `a` and `b` to the variable `G`. However, the definition of `func_1` is not provided. Since `a` and `b` are positive integers and `a ≠ b`, the value of `G` depends on what `func_1` does. Without knowing the implementation of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact value of `G`. But we can state that `G` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer with `a ≠ b`, `G` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**
