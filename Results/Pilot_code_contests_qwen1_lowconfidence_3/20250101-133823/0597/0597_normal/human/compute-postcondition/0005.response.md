Postcondition: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer with `a â‰  b`, `G` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `L` is the result of `func_2(a, b)`, `M` is \(\left(\frac{L}{b} - 1\right) \times G\), `D` is \(L + G - \frac{L \times G}{b}\), and the current value of `D` is greater than `M`**
