`D` is assigned the value `L - M`. The previous value of `L` is `func_2(a, b)` and the previous value of `M` is `((func_2(a, b) / a) - 1) * func_1(a, b)`. Therefore, the new value of `D` is `func_2(a, b) - ((func_2(a, b) / a) - 1) * func_1(a, b)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer with `a â‰  b`, `G` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `L` is the result of `func_2(a, b)`, `M` is ((`L` / `a`) - 1) * `G`, `D` is `L - M`**
