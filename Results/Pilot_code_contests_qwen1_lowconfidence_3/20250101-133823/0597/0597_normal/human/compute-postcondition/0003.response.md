The code assigns the value of `(L / b - 1) * G` to the variable `M`. Here, `L` is the result of `func_2(a, b)`, and `G` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`. Since the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and no new conditions are introduced, we can directly calculate the value of `M`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a positive integer
- `b` is a positive integer with `a ≠ b`
- `G` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`
- `L` is the result of `func_2(a, b)`
- `a < b`

The calculation for `M` is:
\[ M = \left(\frac{L}{b} - 1\right) \times G \]

Since the exact values of `func_1(a, b)` and `func_2(a, b)` are not provided, we keep them as they are.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer with `a ≠ b`, `G` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `L` is the result of `func_2(a, b)`, `M` is \(\left(\frac{L}{b} - 1\right) \times G\)**
