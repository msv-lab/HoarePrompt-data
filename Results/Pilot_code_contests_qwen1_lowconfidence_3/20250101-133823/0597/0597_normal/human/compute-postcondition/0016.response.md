The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers representing the frequency of trains going to Masha's and Dasha's directions respectively, with the condition that \(a \neq b\).

Based on the given conditions:

- **Case_1**: The function returns \(M\), which is calculated as \(\left(\frac{L}{b} - 1\right) \times G\).
- **Case_2**: The function returns \(D \times a\), where \(D = L + G - \frac{L \times G}{b}\) and \(M = \left(\frac{L}{b} - 1\right) \times G\) with the condition \(D \leq M\).
- **Case_3**: The function returns \(M \times a\), where \(M\) is \(\left(\frac{L}{a} - 1\right) \times G\) and \(L\) is the result of `func_2(a, b)`.
- **Case_4**: The function returns \(D \times a\), where \(D\) is \(L - M\) and \(M\) is \(\left(\frac{L}{a} - 1\right) \times G\), and \(D \leq M\).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_6` is to accept two parameters `a` and `b`, and based on the specified conditions, return one of the following values:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns either \(M\), \(D \times a\), \(M \times a\), or \(D \times a\) based on the specified conditions.**
