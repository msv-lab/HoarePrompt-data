The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, where `a â‰  b` and both are within the range [1, 10^6]. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. After executing the algorithm, it returns `a`, which is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and sets `b` to 0. This process handles all valid inputs within the specified range, ensuring that the GCD is correctly calculated and `b` is reset to 0.
