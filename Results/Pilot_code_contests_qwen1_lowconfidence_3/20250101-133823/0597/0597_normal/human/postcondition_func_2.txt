The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list containing exactly two positive integers `[a, b]` where `a ≠ b` and `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6`. It returns the result of applying the function `func_1` to these two integers using the `reduce` function. Since the list always contains exactly two elements, the `reduce` function applies `func_1` once, passing the first element to `func_1` as the initial accumulator value and the second element as the first argument. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling. The function ensures that the input list always contains exactly two elements and that they are distinct positive integers within the specified range.
