The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers containing at least two elements. It then applies the function `func_2` to all pairs of integers in the list using the `reduce` function. The `reduce` function iteratively applies `func_2` to the accumulated result and the next element in the list, starting with the first element. The final result is the cumulative application of `func_2` across all pairs in the list. This process ensures that every pair of integers in the list is processed exactly once. The function returns the final result of this reduction. Potential edge cases include empty lists or lists with only one element, although the function is specified to accept at least two elements. If the list has only one element, the function would still return that element, as there are no pairs to process.
