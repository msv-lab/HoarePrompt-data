Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually solve the given problem. The problem requires determining if there exists a good set of choices to put balls in the boxes based on the given conditions. However, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` defined in the program do not implement the required logic. These functions are placeholders and do not contribute to solving the problem. Therefore, the program does not handle the input as described and does not provide a valid solution.
