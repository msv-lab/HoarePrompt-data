Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_2()` reads an integer `N` from the standard input.
   - `func_3()` reads a list of integers `A` where each integer is either 0 or 1.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - An array `out` of size `N` is initialized to 0, representing the state of each box (whether it contains a ball or not).
   - A boolean variable `fail` is set to `False` to indicate if a solution cannot be found.

3. **Backward Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates backward from `N-1` to `0`.
   - For each box `i`, it calculates the sum `S` of the contents of all boxes that are multiples of `i+1`.
   - If `S % 2` does not match `A[i]`, it sets `out[i]` to 1 and adds `j` (the multiplier) to the list `B`.

4. **Output:**
   - If `B` is not empty, it prints the number of boxes that contain a ball (`len(B)`) followed by the indices of those boxes.
   - If `B` is empty, it prints `-1`.

### Why It Meets the Problem Description:

- **Correct Handling of Constraints:** The program correctly handles the constraints \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and that each \(a_i\) is either 0 or 1.
- **Logic Implementation:** The core logic implemented in the loop ensures that the total number of balls in boxes with multiples of \(i\) written on them is congruent to \(a_i\) modulo 2.
- **Output Format:** The output is formatted correctly according to the problem statement, either printing the count and indices of boxes containing balls or `-1` if no valid configuration exists.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Empty Input:** While the problem assumes valid input, the program would still work correctly for an empty input since the constraints ensure valid inputs.
- **Single Box Case:** For \(N = 1\), the program correctly handles this case by setting the single box to 1 if \(a_1 = 1\) and 0 otherwise.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
