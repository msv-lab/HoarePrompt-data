You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N empty boxes arranged in a row from left to right. The integer i is written on the i-th box from the left (1 \leq i \leq N).

For each of these boxes, Snuke can choose either to put a ball in it or to put nothing in it.

We say a set of choices to put a ball or not in the boxes is good when the following condition is satisfied:

* For every integer i between 1 and N (inclusive), the total number of balls contained in the boxes with multiples of i written on them is congruent to a_i modulo 2.



Does there exist a good set of choices? If the answer is yes, find one good set of choices.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* a_i is 0 or 1.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
a_1 a_2 ... a_N


Output

If a good set of choices does not exist, print `-1`.

If a good set of choices exists, print one such set of choices in the following format:


M
b_1 b_2 ... b_M


where M denotes the number of boxes that will contain a ball, and b_1,\ b_2,\ ...,\ b_M are the integers written on these boxes, in any order.

Functions with output description for each function:
from collections import *
import sys

inp = raw_input
N = func_2()
A = func_3()
out = [0] * N
fail = False
B = []
for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
    j = i + 1
    S = 0
    for k in range(i, N, j):
        S += out[k]
    if S % 2 != A[i]:
        out[i] = 1
        B.append(j)
print(len(B))
if len(B):
    print(' '.join(map(str, B)))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(s):
    sys.stderr.write('{}\n'.format(s))
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as input. It prints the string `s` to the standard error stream. Depending on the length of the string `s`, it returns either "empty string" or "non-empty string". If the string `s` is empty, the function returns "empty string"; otherwise, it returns "non-empty string". The function does not modify the input string `s` and only performs a print operation and returns a string indicating whether the input was empty or non-empty.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return int(inp())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and returns an integer read from standard input using the `inp()` function. The program prompts the user to enter an integer, and upon receiving it, returns that integer. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotation or code that need to be considered. The function simply reads an integer from the user and returns it.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return [int(_) for _ in inp().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers, where each integer is either 0 or 1. It achieves this by reading a single input string from the standard input, splitting the string into individual elements based on spaces, and converting each element to an integer. If an element in the input string is not a valid integer (i.e., not '0' or '1'), the function will raise a ValueError since the list comprehension will attempt to convert non-integer values to integers. There are no specified edge cases in the annotations, but it's important to note that the function expects the input to consist only of '0's and '1's separated by spaces. If the input contains any other characters, the function will fail to execute correctly.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
