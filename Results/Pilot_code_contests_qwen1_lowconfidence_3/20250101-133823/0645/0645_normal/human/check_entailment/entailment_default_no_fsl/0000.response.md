Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem described. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the integer \( N \) and the list \( A \) from standard input using functions `func_2` and `func_3`.
2. **Condition Checking**: The program iterates backward through the list \( A \) and calculates the parity of the number of balls in multiples of the current index. If the parity does not match \( A[i] \), it sets the corresponding box to contain a ball and records the index.
3. **Output Generation**: If a valid configuration is found, the program outputs the count of boxes containing balls followed by the indices of those boxes. If no valid configuration is found, it outputs `-1`.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program handles all necessary conditions and potential cases correctly. The backward iteration ensures that the conditions are checked in a way that respects the divisibility requirements, and the program correctly adjusts the ball placement to meet the modulo 2 condition.

Since the code correctly implements the solution and handles all required cases without any apparent bugs or edge cases that would violate the problem description, the correctness is **True**.
