Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a good set of choices for placing balls in the boxes based on the given conditions. Let's break down the verification process:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values for \( N \) and the list \( A \). This is verified through `func_2` and `func_3`.

2. **Backward Iteration and Calculation**: The program iterates backward from the last index to the first, calculating the necessary state of each box. For each box \( i \), it checks the cumulative sum of the boxes that are multiples of \( i \). If the sum modulo 2 does not match \( A[i] \), it sets the current box to 1 and updates the necessary subsequent boxes accordingly. This ensures that the condition is met for all indices.

3. **Output Generation**: If a valid configuration is found, the program generates the output as required, listing the indices of the boxes that contain a ball.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code handles all specified constraints and input formats correctly. The problem description specifies \( 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and that each \( a_i \) is either 0 or 1. The code processes these inputs as expected without failing due to invalid inputs (like non-integer values in \( A \)).

Given the annotations and the implementation details, the code accurately follows the problem description for every potential case within the given constraints. Thus, the program is correct.
