Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program consists only of function definitions and does not contain any logic to solve the problem as described. Specifically, it does not read input, process the data according to the problem constraints, or output a result. Without any implementation of the solution, the program cannot handle any input and will not produce the correct output for any case. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
