Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not implement the required logic to solve the given problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are placeholders and do not contribute to solving the problem. Specifically, `func_3` is intended to read the input but it does not check if the input adheres to the problem constraints (i.e., only '0's and '1's separated by spaces). Furthermore, the program lacks the core logic to determine if a good set of choices exists and how to construct such a set. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the program is still incorrect.
