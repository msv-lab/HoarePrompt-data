Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program consists solely of function definitions and does not contain any logic to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program does not read input, process the data according to the problem constraints, or output a result. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not contribute to solving the problem at hand. `func_3` reads input, but it does not use the input to determine if there exists a good set of choices for the boxes, nor does it output a solution. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
