The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers, where each integer is either 0 or 1. It achieves this by reading a single input string from the standard input, splitting the string into individual elements based on spaces, and converting each element to an integer. If an element in the input string is not a valid integer (i.e., not '0' or '1'), the function will raise a ValueError since the list comprehension will attempt to convert non-integer values to integers. There are no specified edge cases in the annotations, but it's important to note that the function expects the input to consist only of '0's and '1's separated by spaces. If the input contains any other characters, the function will fail to execute correctly.
