#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    sys.stderr.write('{}\n'.format(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as input. It prints the string `s` to the standard error stream. Depending on the length of the string `s`, it returns either "empty string" or "non-empty string". If the string `s` is empty, the function returns "empty string"; otherwise, it returns "non-empty string". The function does not modify the input string `s` and only performs a print operation and returns a string indicating whether the input was empty or non-empty.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: inp() is a function that reads an integer from standard input.
def func_2():
    return int(inp())
    #The program returns an integer read from standard input using the inp() function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and returns an integer read from standard input using the `inp()` function. The program prompts the user to enter an integer, and upon receiving it, returns that integer. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotation or code that need to be considered. The function simply reads an integer from the user and returns it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of integers where each integer a_i is either 0 or 1.
def func_3():
    return [int(_) for _ in inp().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is either 0 or 1, obtained by splitting the input string using spaces as separators
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers, where each integer is either 0 or 1. It achieves this by reading a single input string from the standard input, splitting the string into individual elements based on spaces, and converting each element to an integer. If an element in the input string is not a valid integer (i.e., not '0' or '1'), the function will raise a ValueError since the list comprehension will attempt to convert non-integer values to integers. There are no specified edge cases in the annotations, but it's important to note that the function expects the input to consist only of '0's and '1's separated by spaces. If the input contains any other characters, the function will fail to execute correctly.
