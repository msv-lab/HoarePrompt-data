Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here’s why:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads inputs in a loop until both `H` and `W` are zero, which marks the end of input as per the constraints. This ensures that all valid inputs within the specified range (1 ≤ H, W ≤ 300) are processed.

2. **Drawing the Chessboard:**
   - The `func_1` function is responsible for drawing the chessboard based on the dimensions `h` and `w`.
   - The nested loops iterate over each cell in the grid. For each cell at position `(i, j)`, the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` determines whether to print `#` or `.`.
   - Specifically, if the sum of the indices `(i + j)` is even, the cell is filled with `#`; if odd, it is filled with `.`.
   - This approach correctly generates the alternating pattern required for a chessboard.

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - After printing each row, an empty line is printed to separate rows, which aligns with the problem description.

4. **Constraints Compliance:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly by ensuring that `H` and `W` are within the specified bounds (1 ≤ H, W ≤ 300).

Given these points, the program consistently meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all valid cases, hence the correctness is **True**.
