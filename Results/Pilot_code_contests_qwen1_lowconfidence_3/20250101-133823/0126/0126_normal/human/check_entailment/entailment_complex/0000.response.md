Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses a `while` loop to continuously read pairs of integers (`H` and `W`) until both are `0`.
   - This handles the termination condition correctly by breaking out of the loop when both `H` and `W` are `0`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The `func_1` function takes two parameters `h` and `w`, which represent the height and width of the chessboard, respectively.
   - The function ensures that both `h` and `w` are within the specified constraints (1 ≤ h, w ≤ 300).

3. **Pattern Generation**:
   - The function iterates over `h` rows and `w` columns using nested loops.
   - For each cell in the grid, it determines whether to print `#` or `.` based on the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0`.
     - If `(i + j) % 2 == 0`, the cell is filled with `#`.
     - Otherwise, the cell is filled with `.`.
   - This logic ensures that each row alternates between `#` and `.` based on the sum of the row and column indices modulo 2.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - After printing each row, the function adds an extra newline character to separate the rows, as required in the problem description.
   - An additional newline is added after all rows are printed for each dataset.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem description match the expected output generated by the program, confirming that the logic is correct.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the chessboard drawing logic as specified in the problem description, and therefore the correctness of the program is **True**.
