Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the chessboard pattern as described. Specifically, the logic for determining whether to print `#` or `.` is flawed. The current implementation uses `(i + j) % 2 == 0` to decide the character, which results in a checkerboard pattern but starts from the top-left corner with `#` instead of alternating rows.

To fix this, the condition should be adjusted to ensure that the top-left corner is `#` and the pattern alternates correctly. Here's a corrected version:

```python
while True:
    (h, w) = map(int, input().split())
    if h == 0 and w == 0:
        break
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            print('#' if (i + j) % 2 == 0 else '.', end='')
        print('')
```

This corrected version ensures that the top-left corner is `#` and the pattern alternates correctly according to the problem description.
