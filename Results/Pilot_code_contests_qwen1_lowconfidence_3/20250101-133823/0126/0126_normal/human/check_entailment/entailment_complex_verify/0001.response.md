Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the logic within the `func_1` function is indeed flawed. Specifically, the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` does not consistently produce the correct alternating pattern for all dimensions of the chessboard. 

For example, consider the case where `H = 3` and `W = 5`:
- The expected output is:
  ```
  #.#.#
  .#.#
  #.#.#
  ```
- However, the current implementation produces:
  ```
  #.#.#
  .#.#
  #.#.#
  ```

This indicates that the logic for determining the pattern is incorrect, leading to the extra row of `#` at the bottom for odd-width boards. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and is thus incorrect.
