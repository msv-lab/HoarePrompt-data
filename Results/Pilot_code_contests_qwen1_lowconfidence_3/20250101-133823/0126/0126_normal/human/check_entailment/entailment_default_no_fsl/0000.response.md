Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly generate the chessboard pattern. According to the problem description, the top-left corner of the chessboard should be filled with `#`. However, the current implementation alternates between `#` and `.` starting from `#` only if the sum of the row index `i` and column index `j` is even. This means the top-left corner is only `#` when both `i` and `j` are even, which is not always the case.

To fix this, the condition should be adjusted to ensure that the top-left corner is always `#`. Specifically, the condition should check if the row index `i` is even and the column index `j` is odd, or if the row index `i` is odd and the column index `j` is even. Here is the corrected code:

```python
while True:
    (h, w) = map(int, input().split())
    if h == 0 and w == 0:
        break
    func_1(h, w)

def func_1(h, w):
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            print('#' if (i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 != 0) or (i % 2 != 0 and j % 2 == 0) else '.')
        print('')
```

With this correction, the top-left corner will always be `#`, and the rest of the pattern will alternate correctly.
