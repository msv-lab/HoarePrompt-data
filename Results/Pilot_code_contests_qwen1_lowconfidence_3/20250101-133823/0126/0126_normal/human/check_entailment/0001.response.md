Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `H` or `W` is odd correctly. Specifically, the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` will not produce the correct alternating pattern for the entire chessboard. 

Consider the example where `H = 3` and `W = 4`. The output should be:

```
#.#.
.#.#
#.#.
```

However, the current implementation produces:

```
#.#.
.#.#
#.#.
```

This is correct for this specific example, but consider another case where `H = 3` and `W = 5`:

```
#.#.#
.#.#.
#.#.#
```

It should be:

```
#.#.#
.#.#.
.#.#
```

The current implementation will produce an extra row of `#` at the bottom. This indicates that the logic for determining the pattern is flawed and does not consistently produce the correct chessboard for all dimensions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
