Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly generate the chessboard pattern as described in the problem description. Specifically, the code generates a pattern where the characters alternate based on the sum of the row index `i` and column index `j` being even or odd. However, the problem description requires that the top-left corner of the chessboard should be drawn by `#`, which means the first row and first column should start with `#`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

- Input: `3 4`
- Expected Output:
  ```
  #.#.
  .#.#  
  #.#.
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  #.#.
  .#.#  
  #.#.
  ```

In the actual output, the first row starts with `#`, which is correct, but the second row starts with `.` instead of `#`. This is because the alternating pattern is based on the sum of `i` and `j` modulo 2, rather than ensuring the top-left corner is always `#`.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that the top-left corner is `#` by adjusting the logic to check if either `i` or `j` is 0 (indicating the start of a new row or column), and set the character accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
while True:
    (h, w) = map(int, input().split())
    if h == 0 and w == 0:
        break
    func_1(h, w)

def func_1(h, w):
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            print('#' if (i == 0 or j == 0) else '.', end='')
        print('')
```

This ensures that the top-left corner is always `#` and the rest of the pattern alternates correctly.
