The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `h` and `w`, which are positive integers between 1 and 300 inclusive. It prints a pattern consisting of `#` and `.` characters to the console. Each row contains `w` characters, alternating between `#` and `.` based on the sum of the row index `i` and column index `j` being even or odd. After executing the function, the console will display `h` rows of this pattern, with an empty line separating each row. The function does not return any value.
