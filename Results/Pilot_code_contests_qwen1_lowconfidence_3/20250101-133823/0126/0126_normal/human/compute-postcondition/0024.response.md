First, let's break down the given code snippet and initial state:

- Initial State:
  - `h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\)
  - `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\)
  - `j` is 1
  - `i` is `w - 2`

The code snippet is:
```python
print('#' if (i + j) % 2 == 0 else '.')
```

This line of code checks if the sum of `i` and `j` is even. If it is even, it prints `'#'`; otherwise, it prints `'.'`.

Since `j` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state, we know:
- `i` is `w - 2`, so \( i = w - 2 \).

Now, we need to determine if `(i + j)` is even or odd:
- `i + j = (w - 2) + 1 = w - 1`.

The expression `(w - 1) % 2` will be:
- `0` if `w - 1` is even (which means `w` is odd).
- `1` if `w - 1` is odd (which means `w` is even).

Therefore, the output depends on whether `w` is odd or even:
- If `w` is odd, `w - 1` is even, and the code prints `'#'`.
- If `w` is even, `w - 1` is odd, and the code prints `'.'`.

After executing the print statement, the values of `h`, `w`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged. So, the updated states are:

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\); `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\); `j` is 1; `i` is `w - 2`; the output is `'#'` if `w` is odd, and `'.'` if `w` is even.**
