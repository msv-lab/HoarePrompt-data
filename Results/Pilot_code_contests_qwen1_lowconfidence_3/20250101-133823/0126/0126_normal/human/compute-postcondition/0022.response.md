The code snippet checks if the sum of `i` and `j` is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints `#`; otherwise, it prints `.`. The value of `i` is `w - 2`. The value of `j` is `0`. Let's calculate the sum of `i` and `j`:

- `i` is `w - 2`
- `j` is `0`

So, the sum is `(w - 2) + 0 = w - 2`.

Since `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), the value of `w - 2` will be in the range \([-1, 298]\). However, because `j` must be within the range \([0, w)\), and `j` is `0`, the sum `w - 2` will always be within the range \([-1, 298]\) but since `j` is `0`, the relevant part of the range is from `1 - 2` to `300 - 2`, which simplifies to the range \([-1, 298]\) but practically `0 - 2` to `299 - 2` which is \([-2, 297]\).

Given that the sum `w - 2` can be even or odd, the output depends on whether this sum is even or odd.

- If `w - 2` is even, the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` is true, and it prints `#`.
- If `w - 2` is odd, the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` is false, and it prints `.`.

Therefore, the output state depends on the parity of `w - 2`.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `j` is 0, `i` is `w - 2`, the output is `#` if `(w - 2) % 2 == 0` and `.` otherwise.**
