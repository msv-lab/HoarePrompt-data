Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `i` is `h-1`, `j` is `w-1`, and the printed output consists of a pattern of `#` and `.` where each row alternates between even and odd sums of indices `(i + j)` modulo 2, with an empty line after each row.**
