Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\) and \(h - 1\)
   - `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\)
   - `j` is `w - 1`
   - `i` is `w`

2. The code snippet:
   ```python
   print('#' if (i + j) % 2 == 0 else '.')
   ```

3. Impact of the code:
   - Calculate the value of `i + j`: Since `i = w` and `j = w - 1`, the sum is `i + j = w + (w - 1) = 2w - 1`.
   - Check if `(i + j) % 2 == 0`: Since `2w - 1` is an odd number, `(2w - 1) % 2` will always be 1 (odd).
   - The condition `(2w - 1) % 2 == 0` is false because `2w - 1` is always odd.

4. Based on the condition being false, the code prints `'.'`.

5. The variables `h`, `w`, `j`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\) and \(h - 1\)
- `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\)
- `j` is `w - 1`
- `i` is `w`
- The printed output is `'.'`

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\) and \(h - 1\); `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\); `j` is `w - 1`; `i` is `w`; printed output is `'.'`.**
