First, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
print('#' if (i + j) % 2 == 0 else '.')
```

This code prints either `'#'` or `'.'` based on the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0`.

Given the initial state:
- `h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\).
- `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\).
- `j` is `w - 1`.
- `i` is `w - 2`.
- `j` must be within the range \([0, w)\).

From the initial state, we can determine:
- `j = w - 1`
- `i = w - 2`

Next, let's evaluate the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0`:

\[ i + j = (w - 2) + (w - 1) = 2w - 3 \]

To determine if `2w - 3` is even or odd, we look at its remainder when divided by 2:

\[ (2w - 3) \% 2 = (2w \% 2 - 3 \% 2) = (0 - 1) = -1 \]

Since `-1 % 2` is equivalent to `1 % 2`, which is 1, the expression `(2w - 3) % 2` evaluates to 1, meaning it is odd.

Therefore, the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` is false, and the code will print `'.'`.

The variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `j` is `w-1`, `i` is `w-2`, `j` must be within the range \([0, w)\); the output is `'.'`.**
