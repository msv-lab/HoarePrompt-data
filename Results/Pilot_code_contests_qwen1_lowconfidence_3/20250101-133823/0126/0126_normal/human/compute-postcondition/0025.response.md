Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `j` is `w-1`, `i` is `w-2`, the output consists of `w` characters where each character is either `#` or `.` based on whether `(i + j) % 2 == 0`.**
