The code prints `'#'` if `(i + j) % 2 == 0` and prints `'.'` otherwise. However, the code does not reassign or update any variables; it only uses the value of `i` and `j` to determine what to print. Since `j` is 0 in the initial state, the condition simplifies to checking if `i % 2 == 0`. The values of `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged.

The output of the print statement depends on the value of `i`, which is not specified. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we can only say that the printed character is either `'#'` if `i` is even or `'.'` if `i` is odd.

Output State: **`h` must be greater than 0, `w` is a positive integer such that 1 <= w <= 300, `j` is 0, and the printed character is either `'#'` if `i` is even or `'.'` if `i` is odd.**
