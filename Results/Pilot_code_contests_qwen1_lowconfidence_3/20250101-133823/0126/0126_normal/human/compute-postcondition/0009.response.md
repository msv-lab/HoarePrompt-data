Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `h` is a positive integer.
   - `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\).
   - `j` is \(w-1\).

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `h-1`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the loop variable `i` would have been one less than its value at the start of the current iteration.
   - Since the loop runs from `0` to `h-1`, if we are at the end of the previous iteration, it means `i` was `h-1`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `0` (the starting point of the next iteration).
   - Therefore, `h` should be decremented by 1 to prepare for the next iteration.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - `h` must be \(h-1\) to allow the loop to proceed.
   - `w` and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop itself.

Given this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `j` is \(w-1\)**
