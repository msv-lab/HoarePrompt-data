Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\)
   - `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\)
   - `j` is 0 (initial value before entering the loop)
   - `i` is `w - 2`
   - The output is `#` if \((w - 2) \% 2 == 0\) and `.` otherwise.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` using `for j in range(w)`.

3. **Current State Analysis:**
   - Since `j` starts from 0, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
   - `i` remains unchanged from the previous iteration and is still `w - 2`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to increment from 0 to 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `i` will remain `w - 2` since it is not affected by the loop.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `h` should remain as a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\).
   - `w` should remain a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\).
   - `j` should be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `i` should remain `w - 2`.

6. **Output Condition:**
   - The output condition \((w - 2) \% 2 == 0\) or \((w - 2) \% 2 != 0\) does not change based on the loop iteration but remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `j` is 1, `i` is `w - 2`**.
