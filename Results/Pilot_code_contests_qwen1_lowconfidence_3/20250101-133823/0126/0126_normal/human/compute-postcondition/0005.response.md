Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `h` is greater than 0.
- `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\).
- `j` is 1.
- The printed character is `.` if `i` is even or `#` if `i` is odd.

### Loop Statement
```
for j in range(w):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `j = 0` to `j = w-1`.
2. **Initial Value of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration Requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be within the range `0` to `w-1`.

Given that `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration, the next value of `j` would be 2.

### Conclusion
For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 2.

### Updated State
- `h` remains greater than 0.
- `w` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\).
- `j` is now 2.
- The printed character is still determined by the parity of `i` (even or odd).

### Final Answer
State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `j` is 2, and the printed character is `.` if `i` is even or `#` if `i` is odd.**
