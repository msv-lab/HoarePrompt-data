Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\)
- `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\)
- `j` is `w - 1`
- `i` is `w - 2`
- `j` must be within the range \([0, w)\)
- The output is `'.'`

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(w):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `j = w - 1`
   - `i = w - 2`
   - `w` is within the range \([1, 300]\)

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` values from 0 to `w-1`.

3. **Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `w - 1`. Since `range(w)` generates values from 0 to `w-1`, `j` being `w - 1` means the current iteration is the last iteration of the loop.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration of the loop, `j` would need to be 0 (the first value in the range).
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1, the next value for `j` would be 0.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `j` will be 0 in the next iteration.
   - `i` remains unchanged as the loop body does not modify it directly. Therefore, `i` will still be `w - 2`.
   - `w` remains unchanged as the loop body does not modify it directly.
   - `h` decreases by 1 since it was stated that `h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\).

### Final Adjusted State:
- `h` is now \(h - 1\)
- `w` remains the same
- `j` is 0
- `i` is `w - 2`
- `j` must be within the range \([0, w)\)

### Final Answer:
State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `j` is 0, `i` is `w - 2`, `j` must be within the range \([0, w)\)**.
