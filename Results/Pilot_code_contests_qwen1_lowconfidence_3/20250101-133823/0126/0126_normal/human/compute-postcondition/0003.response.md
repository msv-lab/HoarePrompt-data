Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `h` must be greater than 0.
   - `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\).
   - `j` is 0.
   - The printed character is either `'#'` if `i` is even or `'.'` if `i` is odd.

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `w-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0, meaning the loop has just started.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Given these conditions, let's update the states:

- `h` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop.
- `w` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop.
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` will be 1.
- The printed character condition remains the same, as it does not depend on the loop variable `j`.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration of the loop are:

**State: **`h` must be greater than 0, `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `j` is 1, and the printed character is either `'#'` if `i` is even or `'.'` if `i` is odd.**
