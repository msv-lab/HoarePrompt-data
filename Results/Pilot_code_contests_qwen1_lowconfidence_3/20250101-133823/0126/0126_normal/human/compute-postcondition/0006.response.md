The code snippet prints a character based on the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0`. The value of `j` is 2. We need to determine whether the printed character will be `#` or `.` based on this condition. Since the exact value of `i` is not given, we can consider the condition `(i + 2) % 2 == 0`.

- If `(i + 2) % 2 == 0`, the character printed is `#`.
- If `(i + 2) % 2 != 0`, the character printed is `.`.

Since the value of `i` is not specified, the printed character could be either `#` or `.` depending on the value of `i`. However, we cannot change the value of any variable other than printing the character. The variables `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `j` is 2, and the printed character is `#` if `(i + 2) % 2 == 0` or `.` if `(i + 2) % 2 != 0`.**
