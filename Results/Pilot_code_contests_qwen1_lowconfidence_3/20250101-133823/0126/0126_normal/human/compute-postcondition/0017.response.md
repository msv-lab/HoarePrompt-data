The code `print('')` simply prints an empty line and does not affect any of the variables `h`, `w`, `j`, or `i`. The printed output for each iteration depends on the values of `i + (w-1)` being even or odd, but this does not change the values of the variables themselves.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\); `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\); `j` is `w-1`; `i` is `w`; the printed output for each iteration is either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on whether `i + (w-1)` is even or odd. An empty line is printed.**
