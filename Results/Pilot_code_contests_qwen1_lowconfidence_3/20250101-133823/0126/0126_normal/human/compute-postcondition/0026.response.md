The `print('')` statement simply prints an empty line, which does not affect any variable values. Therefore, the only change is that an empty line will be printed, but the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `j` is `w-1`, `i` is `w-2`, and an empty line is printed.**
