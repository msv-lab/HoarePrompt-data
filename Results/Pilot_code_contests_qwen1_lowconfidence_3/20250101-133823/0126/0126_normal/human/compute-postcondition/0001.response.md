According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. The loop will execute as long as `w` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 300. Since the initial state provides that `h` must be greater than 0 and `w` is a positive integer such that 1 <= w <= 300, these conditions already ensure that the loop can execute.

However, we need to adjust the state to reflect the starting condition of the loop variable `j`, which will be set to 0 before the loop starts.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `h` must be greater than 0 (this remains unchanged)
- `w` is a positive integer such that 1 <= w <= 300 (this remains unchanged)
- `j` should be set to 0

State: **`h` must be greater than 0, `w` is a positive integer such that 1 <= w <= 300, `j` is 0**
