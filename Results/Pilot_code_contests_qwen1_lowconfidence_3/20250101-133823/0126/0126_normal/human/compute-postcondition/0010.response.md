State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `j` is \(w-1\), `j` must be less than `w`**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop iterates over `j` using `range(w)`, which means `j` will take values from `0` to `w-1`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `j` must be less than `w`.
3. Given that `j` is initially set to `w-1`, we need to ensure that `j < w` to allow at least one iteration of the loop.

Thus, the initial state must be adjusted to ensure `j < w`. Since `j` is defined as `w-1`, this condition is inherently satisfied unless `w` is changed after initialization, but based on the given information, we only need to confirm that `j` is indeed less than `w` to start the loop.
