The code snippet checks if `(i + j) % 2 == 0` and prints `#` if the condition is true, or `.` if the condition is false. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `i`. Since `j` is initially 1, we need to consider two cases based on whether `i` is even or odd.

- If `i` is even, then `(i + 1) % 2 == 1`, and the code will print `.`.
- If `i` is odd, then `(i + 1) % 2 == 0`, and the code will print `#`.

Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific output. But we can express the output in terms of `i`:

- If `i` is even, `print('.')`.
- If `i` is odd, `print('#')`.

The variables `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `j` is 1, and the printed character is `.` if `i` is even or `#` if `i` is odd.**
