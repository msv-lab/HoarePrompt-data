According to the given code and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\).
   - `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\).
   - `j` is `w-1`.
   - `i` is `w`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from `0` to `h-1`.

3. **What Happens in Each Iteration:**
   - For each iteration, the value of `i` decreases from `w` to `0` as the loop progresses.
   - An empty line is printed.
   - Depending on whether `i + (w-1)` is even or odd, the output for each iteration is either `'#'` or `'.'`.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\).
   - `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\).
   - `j` is `w-1`.
   - `i` is `w-1` (since `i` was decreased by 1 from the previous state).

5. **Determining the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range `0` to `h-1`.
   - Since `i` was `w-1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` should now be `w-2`.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be decreased by 1 from `w-1` to `w-2`.
   - The value of `h` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.

6. **Adjusted States:**
   - `h` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `w` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `j` remains `w-1` because `j` is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` is now `w-2`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `j` is `w-1`, `i` is `w-2`**.
