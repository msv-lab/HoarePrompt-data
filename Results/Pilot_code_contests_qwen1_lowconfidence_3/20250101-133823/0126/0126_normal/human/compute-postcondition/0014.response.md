Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\) and \(h - 1\).
   - `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\).
   - `j` is `w`.
   - `i` is `w`.
   - The output is `'#'`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(w):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop runs for each value of `j` in the range from `0` to `w-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was equal to `w`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented from `w` to `w - 1`.
   - Therefore, `j` will now be `w - 1`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `h` remains unchanged as it does not depend on the loop variable `j`.
   - `w` remains unchanged.
   - `j` is now `w - 1`.
   - `i` remains `w`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\) and \(h - 1\).
   - `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\).
   - `j` is `w - 1`.
   - `i` is `w`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\) and \(h - 1\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `j` is `w - 1`, `i` is `w`**.
