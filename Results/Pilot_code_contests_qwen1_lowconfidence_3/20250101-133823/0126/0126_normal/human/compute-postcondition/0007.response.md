Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over the range from 0 to \(w-1\) (inclusive). During each iteration, it prints either `'#'` or `'.'` based on the condition \((i + j) \% 2 == 0\).

### Key Observations
1. **Condition**: The loop prints `'#'` if \((i + j) \% 2 == 0\) and `'.'` otherwise.
2. **Iteration Count**: The loop runs exactly \(w\) times.
3. **Final Values**:
   - `j` will take the final value of \(w-1\).
   - The printed characters will follow the pattern based on the condition for each \(j\) from 0 to \(w-1\).

### Final State After All Iterations
After the loop completes its \(w\) iterations, the following conditions will hold:
- `h` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
- `w` remains unchanged and is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\).
- `j` will be \(w-1\).
- The printed characters will be determined by the condition \((i + j) \% 2 == 0\) for each \(j\) from 0 to \(w-1\).

### Constructing the Output State
Since the loop runs exactly \(w\) times, the printed characters will cover the entire range of \(j\) values from 0 to \(w-1\). Therefore, the final output state will reflect these conditions:

### Output State:
Output State: **`h` is a positive integer, `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `j` is \(w-1\), and the printed characters follow the pattern \((i + j) \% 2 == 0\) for each \(j\) from 0 to \(w-1\).**
