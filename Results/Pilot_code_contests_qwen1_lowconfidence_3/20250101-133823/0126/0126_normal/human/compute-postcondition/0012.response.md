Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\).
   - `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\).
   - `j` is \(w - 1\).
   - The output is either `'#'` if `i + (w-1)` is even, or `'.'` if `i + (w-1)` is odd.

2. **Loop Statement**: The for loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `w-1`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `j = 0` and increases `j` by 1 at each iteration, the value of `j` at the start of the next iteration will be `j + 1`.
   - Given that `j` was initially set to `w - 1`, the next value of `j` will be `w - 1 + 1 = w`.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `h` decreases by 1 each iteration since it was stated that `h` is `>= 1` and `< original h`.
   - `w` remains unchanged as there is no indication that it changes within the loop.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not mentioned in the loop or its conditions.

5. **Output Condition**:
   - The output condition `if i + (w-1)` is still valid for the next iteration, but the value of `j` will now be `w`.

Therefore, the updated states at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:
- `h` decreases by 1, so it is now \(h - 1\).
- `w` remains the same.
- `j` is now `w`.

Since `i + (w-1)` is used to determine the output, and assuming `i` does not change, the output logic remains the same.

Final Answer:
State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\) and \(h - 1\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `j` is \(w\), and the output is either `'#'` if `i + (w-1)` is even, or `'.'` if `i + (w-1)` is odd.**
