State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `j` is `w-1`, `i` is `w-2`, `j` must be within the range \([0, w)\)**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\).
   - `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\).
   - `j` is set to `w-1`.
   - `i` is set to `w-2`.

2. **For Loop Condition**:
   - The for loop iterates over `j` using `range(w)`, which means `j` should iterate from `0` to `w-1`.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must be within the range \([0, w)\). This ensures that the loop will start at `j=0` and continue until `j=w-1`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Given that `j` is initially set to `w-1`, the loop will start at `j=w-1` and decrement `j` in each iteration.
   - To ensure the loop executes, `j` must start at `0` and go up to `w-1`.

Thus, the initial value of `j` (`w-1`) needs to be adjusted to `0` for the loop to execute properly.

### Final State:
- `h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\).
- `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\).
- `j` is `0` (adjusted from `w-1`).
- `i` is `w-2`.

Therefore, the final state needed for the loop to execute is:
**`h` is a positive integer such that \(h \geq 1\) and \(h < \text{original } h\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `j` is `0`, `i` is `w-2`, `j` must be within the range \([0, w)\)**
