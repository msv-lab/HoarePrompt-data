According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `h`. For the loop to execute, `h` must be at least 1. Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will run for `h` iterations if `h` is greater than 0.

Given the initial state where `h` and `w` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), we need to ensure that `h` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The value of `w` does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`h` must be greater than 0, `w` is a positive integer such that 1 <= w <= 300**
