The function `func()` takes three parameters: an integer `n`, a string `field` of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">", and a list `power` of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, inclusive. It processes the `field` string and `power` list to determine if a sequence of movements based on the direction indicated by the characters in `field` leads to an infinite loop or a finite position. Specifically, the function iterates through the `field` string, updating the `power` values and the current position `pos` according to the direction indicated by each character. If the function reaches the end of the `field` string without hitting a zero in the `power` list, it concludes that the sequence is finite and prints 'FINITE'. Otherwise, if the function encounters a zero in the `power` list, it determines the position and prints 'INFINITE'. Potential edge cases include the starting position being at the end of the string due to the initial movement direction.
