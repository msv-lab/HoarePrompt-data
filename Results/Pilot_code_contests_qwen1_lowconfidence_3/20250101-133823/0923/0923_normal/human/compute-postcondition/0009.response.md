Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an unspecified integer between 1 and 100,000.
   - `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">".
   - `di` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq \text{di}[i] \leq 10^9\).
   - `power[0]` is `0`.
   - `pos` is either `1` if `field[0]` is `'>',` or `n-1` if `field[0]` is `'<'`, and `power[pos]` must be non-zero.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `power[pos], pos = 0, pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]` updates both `power[pos]` and `pos`.
     - First, `power[pos]` is set to `0`.
     - Next, the new value of `pos` is calculated using the expression `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]`.

3. **Breaking Down the Expression**:
   - Since `power[pos]` is now `0`, the term `(2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]` simplifies to `0` regardless of the value of `field[pos]`.
   - Therefore, `pos` remains unchanged because adding `0` to `pos` does not affect its value.

4. **Updated Values**:
   - `power[pos]` is updated to `0`.
   - `pos` remains the same as its initial value (either `1` or `n-1`).

5. **Final Output State**:
   - The initial conditions for `n`, `field`, `di`, and `power[0]` remain unchanged.
   - The updated value of `power[pos]` is `0`.
   - The value of `pos` remains the same as before the execution of the code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an unspecified integer between 1 and 100,000; `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">"; `di` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq \text{di}[i] \leq 10^9\); `power[0]` is `0`; `pos` is either `1` if `field[0]` is `'>',` or `n-1` if `field[0]` is `'<'`, and `power[pos]` is `0`.**
