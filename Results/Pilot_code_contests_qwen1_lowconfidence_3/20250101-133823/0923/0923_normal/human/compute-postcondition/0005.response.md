Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The line `power[pos], pos = 0, pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]` does two things:
   - It assigns `0` to `power[pos]`.
   - It updates `pos` based on the value of `field[pos]`.

2. The expression `2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1` evaluates to:
   - `1` if `field[pos]` is `'>`'.
   - `-1` if `field[pos]` is `'<'`.

3. So, `pos` will be updated as follows:
   - If `field[pos]` is `'>',` then `pos` becomes `pos + 1`.
   - If `field[pos]` is `'<'`, then `pos` becomes `pos - 1`.

4. Given the initial conditions:
   - `n` is an unspecified integer between 1 and 100,000.
   - `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">".
   - `di` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq \text{di}[i] \leq 10^9\).
   - `power` is a list of integers derived from the input.
   - `pos` is initially `0`.
   - \(\text{power}[0] \neq 0\).

After executing the line of code, the following changes occur:
- `power[pos]` becomes `0`.
- `pos` is updated based on the value of `field[pos]`.

Since `pos` starts at `0` and `field[0]` can be either `'>`' or `'<'`, let's consider both cases:
- If `field[0]` is `'>',` then `pos` becomes `0 + 1 = 1`.
- If `field[0]` is `'<'`, then `pos` becomes `0 - 1 = -1`.

However, since `pos` should remain within the bounds of the list indices (0 to `n-1`), if `pos` becomes `-1`, it will wrap around to `n-1`.

So, the updated values are:
- `power[0]` is `0`.
- `pos` is either `1` if `field[0]` is `'>',` or `n-1` if `field[0]` is `'<'`.

Output State: **`n` is an unspecified integer between 1 and 100,000; `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">"; `di` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq \text{di}[i] \leq 10^9\); `power` is a list of integers derived from the input, with `power[0]` being `0`; `pos` is either `1` if `field[0]` is `'>',` or `n-1` if `field[0]` is `'<'`.**
