`field` is assigned the value of the string input from the user using `raw_input()`. The value of `n` remains an unspecified integer between 1 and 100,000. The list `di` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an unspecified integer between 1 and 100,000, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">", and `di` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `di` ≤ 109.**
