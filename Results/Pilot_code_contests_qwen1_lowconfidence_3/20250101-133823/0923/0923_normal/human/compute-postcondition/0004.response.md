To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute at least once, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues:

The loop condition is:
\[ 0 \leq \text{pos} < n \text{ and } \text{power}[ \text{pos} ] \neq 0 \]

Given the current state before the loop:
- `n` is an unspecified integer between 1 and 100,000.
- `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">".
- `di` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq \text{di}[i] \leq 10^9\).
- `power` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `pos` is 0.

For the loop to execute at least once, the following conditions must hold:
1. \(0 \leq \text{pos} < n\) must be true.
2. \(\text{power}[\text{pos}] \neq 0\) must be true.

Since `pos` is currently 0, the first condition \(0 \leq \text{pos} < n\) is already satisfied as long as \(n > 0\).

The second condition \(\text{power}[\text{pos}] \neq 0\) means that \(\text{power}[0] \neq 0\). This must be true for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring that \(\text{power}[0] \neq 0\).

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an unspecified integer between 1 and 100,000, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">", `di` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq \text{di}[i] \leq 10^9\), `power` is a list of integers derived from the input, `pos` is 0, and \(\text{power}[0] \neq 0\)**.
