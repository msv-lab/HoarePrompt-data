The code `n = input()` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, the value of `n` remains within this range after executing the code. However, the exact value of `n` is not specified in the input, so it remains as an unspecified integer within the given range. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an unspecified integer between 1 and 100,000, and the next two lines contain a string of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">", and a list of `n` integers `di` where 1 ≤ `di` ≤ 109, respectively.**
