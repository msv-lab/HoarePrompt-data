Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The line `power[pos], pos = 0, pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]` means two things happen:
   - First, `power[pos]` is set to `0`.
   - Second, `pos` is updated to `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]`.

2. Given that `power[pos]` is now `0`, the second part simplifies to:
   - `pos` is updated to `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * 0`, which means `pos` remains unchanged.

3. Since `pos` does not change, `pos` still equals either `1` if `field[0]` is `'>',` or `n-1` if `field[0]` is `'<'`, and \(\text{power}[\text{pos}] = 0\).

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an unspecified integer between 1 and 100,000; `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">"; `di` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq \text{di}[i] \leq 10^9\); `power[0]` is `0`; `pos` is either `1` if `field[0]` is `'>',` or `n-1` if `field[0]` is `'<'`.**
