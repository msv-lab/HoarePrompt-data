The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer), a string of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">", and a list of `n` integers `di` where each `di` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, inclusive. The function does not return anything based on the given output cases, so it likely modifies some state or performs some action rather than returning a value.

However, since the problem specifically asks for the parameters and return value, and considering the provided format, we should describe the return value based on the constraints and relationships given, even though the actual return value isn't specified in the problem statement.
