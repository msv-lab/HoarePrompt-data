`power` is assigned the result of mapping `int` over the input split by spaces. The original `n` and `field` are not affected by this operation, and `di` remains unchanged. The `raw_input().split()` function reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The `map(int, ...)` function then converts each of these strings into an integer.

Since the exact input is not specified, we cannot determine the specific values of `power`. However, we know that `power` will be a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an unspecified integer between 1 and 100,000, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">", `di` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `di` ≤ 109, `power` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
