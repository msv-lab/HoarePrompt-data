To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
\[ 0 \leq \text{pos} < n \quad \text{and} \quad \text{power[pos]} \neq 0 \]

This means that for the loop to continue executing, both conditions must be true:
1. The position `pos` must be within the bounds of the array (i.e., `0 \leq \text{pos} < n`).
2. The value of `power[pos]` must not be zero.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an unspecified integer between 1 and 100,000.
- `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">".
- `di` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq \text{di}[i] \leq 10^9\).
- `power[0]` is `0`.
- `pos` is either `1` if `field[0]` is `'>',` or `n-1` if `field[0]` is `'<'`.

Since `power[0]` is `0`, the second condition (`\text{power[pos]} \neq 0`) is already not satisfied, making the loop terminate. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `power[pos]` becomes non-zero.

Let's summarize the adjustments needed:

- We need to change the state such that `power[pos]` is non-zero.
- Since the loop is checking the bounds `0 \leq \text{pos} < n`, and the current `pos` value is either `1` or `n-1`, we don't need to adjust the bounds condition.

Therefore, the state at the end of the next iteration should ensure that `power[pos]` is non-zero.

State: **`n` is an unspecified integer between 1 and 100,000; `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">"; `di` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq \text{di}[i] \leq 10^9\); `power[0]` is `0`; `pos` is either `1` if `field[0]` is `'>',` or `n-1` if `field[0]` is `'<'`, and `power[pos]` must be non-zero**.
