The code checks if `0 <= pos < n` and prints 'INFINITE' if the condition is not met, otherwise it prints 'FINITE'. Since `pos` is either `0` or `n` based on the first character of `field`, and `n` is an unspecified integer between 1 and 100,000, the condition `0 <= pos < n` will always be false because `pos` is either `0` or `n`. Therefore, the code will print 'INFINITE'.

The output of the `print` function does not change the state of the variables; it only outputs a string. Hence, the values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an unspecified integer between 1 and 100,000; `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">"; `di` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq \text{di}[i] \leq 10^9\); `power` is a list of integers derived from the input, with all elements set to `0`; `pos` is either `0` or `n` depending on whether `field[0]` is `'>'` or `'<'`, respectively; the output is 'INFINITE'.**
