The code assigns the value 0 to the variable `pos`. The values of the other variables (`field`, `di`, and `power`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `pos` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an unspecified integer between 1 and 100,000, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">", `di` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `di` ≤ 109, `power` is a list of integers derived from the input, `pos` is 0.**
