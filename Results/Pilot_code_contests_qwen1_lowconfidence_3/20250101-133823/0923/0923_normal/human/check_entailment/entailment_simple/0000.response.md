Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the input values:
     - `n` (the length of the strip) as an integer.
     - `field` (a string of length `n` containing directions `<` and `>`).
     - `power` (a list of `n` integers representing the jump lengths).

2. **Initial State Initialization**:
   - `pos` is initialized to `0`, representing the starting position of the grasshopper.

3. **Jumping Logic**:
   - The while loop runs as long as `pos` is within the bounds of the strip (`0 <= pos < n`) and the current jump length (`power[pos]`) is non-zero.
   - Inside the loop, the current jump length is set to `0` to prevent the grasshopper from repeating the same jump.
   - The new position `pos` is updated based on the direction:
     - If `field[pos] == '>'`, `pos` is incremented by `power[pos]`.
     - If `field[pos] == '<'`, `pos` is decremented by `power[pos]`.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - After the loop, if `pos` is still within the bounds of the strip (`0 <= pos < n`), it means the grasshopper has entered an infinite cycle, and the program prints "INFINITE".
   - Otherwise, if `pos` is outside the strip, the grasshopper has jumped out, and the program prints "FINITE".

5. **Assumptions**:
   - The program assumes valid input as per the problem statement. It correctly handles the constraints (`1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000`, `1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9`).

Given these points, the program accurately follows the problem description and will produce the correct output for any valid input. Therefore, the program is correct.
