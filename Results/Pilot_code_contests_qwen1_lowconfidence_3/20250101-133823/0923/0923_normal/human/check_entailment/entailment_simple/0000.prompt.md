You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Little Artem found a grasshopper. He brought it to his house and constructed a jumping area for him.

The area looks like a strip of cells 1 × n. Each cell contains the direction for the next jump and the length of that jump. Grasshopper starts in the first cell and follows the instructions written on the cells. Grasshopper stops immediately if it jumps out of the strip. Now Artem wants to find out if this will ever happen.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — length of the strip. 

Next line contains a string of length n which consists of characters "<" and ">" only, that provide the direction of the jump from the corresponding cell. Next line contains n integers di (1 ≤ di ≤ 109) — the length of the jump from the i-th cell.

Output

Print "INFINITE" (without quotes) if grasshopper will continue his jumps forever. Otherwise print "FINITE" (without quotes).

Examples

Input

2
&gt;&lt;
1 2


Output

FINITE


Input

3
&gt;&gt;&lt;
2 1 1


Output

INFINITE

Note

In the first sample grasshopper starts from the first cell and jumps to the right on the next cell. When he is in the second cell he needs to jump two cells left so he will jump out of the strip.

Second sample grasshopper path is 1 - 3 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 3 and so on. The path is infinite.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, and the next two lines contain a string of length n consisting of characters "<" and ">", and a list of n integers di where 1 ≤ di ≤ 109, respectively.
def func():
    n = input()
    field = raw_input()
    power = map(int, raw_input().split())
    pos = 0
    while 0 <= pos < n and power[pos] != 0:
        power[pos], pos = 0, pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an unspecified integer between 1 and 100,000; `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">"; `di` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq \text{di}[i] \leq 10^9\); `power` is a list of integers derived from the input, with all elements set to `0`; `pos` is either `0` or `n` depending on whether `field[0]` is `'>'` or `'<'`, respectively.
    print('INFINITE' if 0 <= pos < n else 'FINITE')

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
