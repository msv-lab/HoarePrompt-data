Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where the grasshopper's position exceeds the bounds of the strip. Specifically, the code updates the position using the formula `pos = pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]`, which may result in `pos` becoming greater than or equal to `n` or less than `0`. However, the code only checks if `0 <= pos < n` after the loop, which means it does not detect if the grasshopper has already jumped out of bounds during the loop.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
>><
1 2 1
```

- The grasshopper starts at position 0 and jumps to the right (position 1) with a length of 1.
- From position 1, the grasshopper jumps to the left (position 0) with a length of 2.
- From position 0, the grasshopper jumps to the right (position 1) with a length of 1.

This results in an infinite loop, but the code incorrectly prints "FINITE" because it only checks the final position after the loop, not during the loop execution.

To fix this, the code should update the position within the loop and check if the position is out of bounds immediately after each jump. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    field = input()
    power = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pos = 0
    while 0 <= pos < n and power[pos] != 0:
        pos_new = pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]
        if not (0 <= pos_new < n):
            print('INFINITE')
            return
        pos = pos_new
    print('FINITE')
```

This corrected version ensures that the grasshopper's position is checked for out-of-bounds conditions immediately after each jump, thus correctly identifying infinite loops or finite positions.
