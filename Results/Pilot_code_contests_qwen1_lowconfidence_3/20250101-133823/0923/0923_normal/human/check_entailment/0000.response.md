Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in how it updates the position of the grasshopper. Specifically, the expression `(2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1)` will either evaluate to `1` if the direction is '>' or `-1` if the direction is '<'. However, the program does not handle the case where the grasshopper's new position would be outside the strip boundaries. 

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
3
&gt;&gt;&lt;
2 1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
INFINITE
```

However, the program will incorrectly output:
```
FINITE
```

This is because the program does not reset the jump length to 0 when it goes out of bounds, and it does not properly account for the infinite loop scenario where the grasshopper keeps jumping back and forth within the strip. 

To fix this, the program should ensure that once the grasshopper jumps out of bounds, it correctly identifies this as an "INFINITE" loop rather than continuing the loop. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    field = input()
    power = list(map(int, input().split()))
    visited = [False] * n
    pos = 0
    
    while 0 <= pos < n and not visited[pos]:
        visited[pos] = True
        (power[pos], pos) = (0, pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos])
    
    if 0 <= pos < n:
        print('FINITE')
    else:
        print('INFINITE')

func()
```

This corrected version uses a `visited` array to keep track of cells that have already been visited, ensuring that the program correctly identifies an infinite loop if the grasshopper revisits a cell.
