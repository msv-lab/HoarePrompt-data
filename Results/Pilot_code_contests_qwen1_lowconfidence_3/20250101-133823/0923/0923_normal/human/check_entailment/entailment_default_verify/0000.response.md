Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code still has issues with handling the case where the grasshopper's position goes out of bounds, even though it now uses a `visited` array to detect cycles. The key issue remains that the program does not correctly identify when the grasshopper jumps out of the strip boundaries, leading to an incorrect determination of whether the sequence is finite or infinite. 

For example, consider the input:

```
3
&gt;&gt;&lt;
2 1 1
```

The expected output is `INFINITE`, but the program incorrectly outputs `FINITE` because it does not reset the jump length to 0 when the grasshopper jumps out of bounds. The revised code should handle this edge case properly to ensure correctness.
