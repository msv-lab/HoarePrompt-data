You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Artem found a grasshopper. He brought it to his house and constructed a jumping area for him.

The area looks like a strip of cells 1 × n. Each cell contains the direction for the next jump and the length of that jump. Grasshopper starts in the first cell and follows the instructions written on the cells. Grasshopper stops immediately if it jumps out of the strip. Now Artem wants to find out if this will ever happen.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — length of the strip. 

Next line contains a string of length n which consists of characters "<" and ">" only, that provide the direction of the jump from the corresponding cell. Next line contains n integers di (1 ≤ di ≤ 109) — the length of the jump from the i-th cell.

Output

Print "INFINITE" (without quotes) if grasshopper will continue his jumps forever. Otherwise print "FINITE" (without quotes).

Examples

Input

2
&gt;&lt;
1 2


Output

FINITE


Input

3
&gt;&gt;&lt;
2 1 1


Output

INFINITE

Note

In the first sample grasshopper starts from the first cell and jumps to the right on the next cell. When he is in the second cell he needs to jump two cells left so he will jump out of the strip.

Second sample grasshopper path is 1 - 3 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 3 and so on. The path is infinite.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = input()
    field = raw_input()
    power = map(int, raw_input().split())
    pos = 0
    while 0 <= pos < n and power[pos] != 0:
        (power[pos], pos) = (0, pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos])
    print('INFINITE' if 0 <= pos < n else 'FINITE')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in how it updates the position of the grasshopper. Specifically, the expression `(2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1)` will either evaluate to `1` if the direction is '>' or `-1` if the direction is '<'. However, the program does not handle the case where the grasshopper's new position would be outside the strip boundaries. 

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
3
&gt;&gt;&lt;
2 1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
INFINITE
```

However, the program will incorrectly output:
```
FINITE
```

This is because the program does not reset the jump length to 0 when it goes out of bounds, and it does not properly account for the infinite loop scenario where the grasshopper keeps jumping back and forth within the strip. 

To fix this, the program should ensure that once the grasshopper jumps out of bounds, it correctly identifies this as an "INFINITE" loop rather than continuing the loop. Here’s a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    field = input()
    power = list(map(int, input().split()))
    visited = [False] * n
    pos = 0
    
    while 0 <= pos < n and not visited[pos]:
        visited[pos] = True
        (power[pos], pos) = (0, pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos])
    
    if 0 <= pos < n:
        print('FINITE')
    else:
        print('INFINITE')

func()
```

This corrected version uses a `visited` array to keep track of cells that have already been visited, ensuring that the program correctly identifies an infinite loop if the grasshopper revisits a cell.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, and the next two lines contain a string of length n consisting of characters "<" and ">", and a list of n integers di where 1 ≤ di ≤ 109, respectively.
def func():
    n = input()
    field = raw_input()
    power = map(int, raw_input().split())
    pos = 0
    while 0 <= pos < n and power[pos] != 0:
        power[pos], pos = 0, pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an unspecified integer between 1 and 100,000; `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">"; `di` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq \text{di}[i] \leq 10^9\); `power` is a list of integers derived from the input, with all elements set to `0`; `pos` is either `0` or `n` depending on whether `field[0]` is `'>'` or `'<'`, respectively.
    print('INFINITE' if 0 <= pos < n else 'FINITE')


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
