Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` representing the length of the strip.
   - It then reads a string `field` of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">".
   - Finally, it reads a list `power` of `n` integers where each integer represents the length of the jump from the corresponding cell.

2. **Processing Logic**:
   - The program initializes the position `pos` to 0.
   - It uses a `while` loop to simulate the grasshopper's jumps:
     - The loop continues as long as `pos` is within bounds (0 to `n-1`) and the current jump length (`power[pos]`) is non-zero.
     - Inside the loop, the jump length is set to 0 to indicate it has been used.
     - The position `pos` is updated based on the direction specified by `field[pos]`: 
       - If `field[pos]` is '>', `pos` increases by `power[pos]`.
       - If `field[pos]` is '<', `pos` decreases by `power[pos]`.

3. **Loop Condition and Output**:
   - After exiting the loop, if `pos` is still within bounds (0 to `n-1`), the grasshopper has not jumped out of the strip, indicating an infinite loop, so the program prints "INFINITE".
   - If `pos` is out of bounds, the grasshopper has jumped out of the strip, indicating a finite sequence, so the program prints "FINITE".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the grasshopper might start at the boundary of the strip. For instance, if the first jump is to the left and `pos` becomes -1, it exits the loop.
   - The program correctly sets the jump length to 0 to prevent reusing the same jump multiple times.

Given these points, the program accurately follows the problem description and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs, hence it is correct.
