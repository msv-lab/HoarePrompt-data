Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the grasshopper jumps out of the strip but the `pos` variable becomes negative due to the jump length being large. For example, consider the following input:

```
3
&gt;&lt;&lt;
3 2 1
```

In this case, the grasshopper starts at position 0 and jumps 3 cells to the right, landing at position 3. Since the strip is only 3 cells long, this is out of bounds, but the program does not detect this and continues to evaluate the next cell, which is out of range. Therefore, the program should return "FINITE" but instead, it might enter an infinite loop or return an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program should ensure that the grasshopper's position is always within the valid range before continuing the loop. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    field = input()
    power = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pos = 0
    while 0 <= pos < n and power[pos] != 0:
        new_pos = pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]
        if 0 <= new_pos < n:
            power[pos] = 0
            pos = new_pos
        else:
            break
    print('INFINITE' if 0 <= pos < n else 'FINITE')
```

This corrected version ensures that the grasshopper's position is always checked against the strip boundaries before updating it.
