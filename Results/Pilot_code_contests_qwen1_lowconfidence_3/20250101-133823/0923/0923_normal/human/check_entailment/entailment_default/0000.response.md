Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the grasshopper will continue its jumps forever or stop. The code uses `raw_input()` and `input()` functions, which are not standard Python 3 functions. Instead, it should use `input()` for both reading the integer `n` and the string `field`. Additionally, the logic to update the position and check for an infinite loop is flawed.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    field = input()
    power = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    visited = [False] * n
    pos = 0
    
    while 0 <= pos < n and not visited[pos]:
        visited[pos] = True
        next_pos = pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]
        if next_pos < 0 or next_pos >= n:
            print('FINITE')
            return
        pos = next_pos
    
    print('INFINITE')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version uses `int(input())` to read the integer `n`, ensures that the position is within bounds, and keeps track of visited positions to detect cycles, ensuring the program works correctly for every potential case.
