The code `sys.stdout = BytesIO()` assigns the `BytesIO` object to `sys.stdout`. This changes how output is handled, but it does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `x_i`, or `v_i`. The initial state remains unchanged except for the redirection of standard output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the second line contains a list of n integers x_i, where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^8 and all x_i are distinct; the third line contains a list of n integers v_i, where -10^8 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^8; sys.stdout is redirected to BytesIO()**
