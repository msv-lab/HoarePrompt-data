The given code snippet uses `atexit.register` to register a lambda function that writes the contents of `sys.stdout.getvalue()` to `os.write(1)`. This means that when the script exits, it will print the contents of `sys.stdout` to the standard output (usually the terminal).

However, the code does not modify any of the variables in the initial state directly. It only sets up a callback to write to `sys.stdout` at the end of the script. Therefore, the values of `n`, the list `x_i`, the list `v_i`, and `sys.stdout` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the second line contains a list of n integers x_i, where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^8 and all x_i are distinct; the third line contains a list of n integers v_i, where -10^8 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^8; sys.stdout is redirected to BytesIO() and at the end of the script, the contents of sys.stdout will be written to the standard output.**
