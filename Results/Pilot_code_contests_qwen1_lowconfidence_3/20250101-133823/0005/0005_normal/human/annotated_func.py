#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The second line contains a list of n integers x_i, where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^8 and all x_i are distinct. The third line contains a list of n integers v_i, where -10^8 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^8.
def func_1():
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    #The program returns a readline object from BytesIO containing the input data read from standard input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and it reads input from standard input (stdin). It then processes this input by first redirecting stdout to a BytesIO object. After processing, it registers a lambda function using `atexit` to write the content of the BytesIO object back to stdout. Finally, it returns a `readline` object from the BytesIO object containing the original input data read from stdin. However, there is a potential issue: the function does not actually read the input from stdin; instead, it attempts to read the current file size from stdin, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the file size is not correctly interpreted. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where stdin might be empty or where the file size cannot be determined correctly.
