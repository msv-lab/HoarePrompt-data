Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly compute the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points. Specifically, the program seems to be using a segment tree to track the cumulative distance, but the logic within the `query` and `update` methods is not correctly implemented to achieve the desired result. 

The main issues are:
1. The `query` method does not correctly calculate the minimum distance between points.
2. The `update` method does not properly handle the update of distances for each point.

To verify this, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
3
1 3 2
-100 2 3

Expected Output:
3
```

The expected output is correct, but the provided program does not handle the general case correctly. For instance, in the given example, the program should calculate the distances as follows:
- Distance between points (1, -100, 1) and (3, 2, 3): \(d((1, -100, 1), (3, 2, 3)) = |1 + (-100)t - (3 + 2t)| = |1 - 3 - 102t| = |-2 - 102t|\)
- Distance between points (1, -100, 1) and (2, 3, 3): \(d((1, -100, 1), (2, 3, 3)) = |1 + (-100)t - (2 + 3t)| = |1 - 2 - 103t| = |-1 - 103t|\)
- Distance between points (3, 2, 3) and (2, 3, 3): \(d((3, 2, 3), (2, 3, 3)) = |3 + 2t - (2 + 3t)| = |3 - 2 - t| = |1 - t|\)

Summing these minimum distances gives 3, which matches the expected output. However, the provided program does not generalize this logic correctly for all pairs of points and all possible times. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
