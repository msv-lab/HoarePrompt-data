Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` attempts to read the input size from stdin but does not actually process the input correctly. Instead of reading the input from stdin, it tries to read the current file size, which is not relevant for the input provided by the user. This leads to incorrect handling of the input data.

2. **Logic Errors**: The main logic of the program uses an `order_tree` class for some kind of query and update operations, but the implementation of these operations is not directly related to the problem's requirements. The code seems to be trying to calculate the minimum distances between points, but the structure and logic used do not align with the problem's description.

3. **Potential Missing Cases**: The code does not explicitly handle the calculation of the minimum distance \(d(i, j)\) between each pair of points. The current implementation does not seem to properly compute the distances over time and sum them up as required.

Given these issues, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
