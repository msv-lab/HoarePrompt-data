Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1()`**: 
   - The `func_1()` function is defined but not called within the main program. Instead, the program directly uses `input()` to read the input from standard input. Since `func_1()` is defined but not utilized, it seems to be a leftover or a mistake in the code. The function `func_1()` does not contribute to the core functionality of the program and can be safely removed without affecting the program's behavior.

2. **Missing Core Logic**:
   - The main logic to compute the sum of minimum distances \( \sum_{1 \le i < j \le n} d(i, j) \) is present, but it relies on the `order_tree` class, which is not explained in detail in the problem description. The `order_tree` class appears to be an implementation of a segment tree, but the problem description does not mention the use of a segment tree or any specific data structure for this purpose. Therefore, the use of this class makes the program deviate from the straightforward approach implied by the problem description.

3. **Potential Issue with Input Handling**:
   - While the program assumes that the input will be valid and well-formed, the problem description does not specify the need for handling invalid inputs. However, the program should ideally include checks to ensure that the input adheres to the constraints mentioned (e.g., `2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`, `1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^8`, `-10^8 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^8`).

### Correct Approach Based on Problem Description:
- The problem description suggests a simpler approach to solving the problem without explicitly mentioning the use of a segment tree. A more straightforward solution would involve sorting the points and their speeds, and then iterating through the points to compute the minimum distances.
- The core idea is to sort the points based on their speeds and then calculate the distances considering the relative positions of the points.

Given these issues, the program is not entirely correct according to the problem description. The inclusion of the `order_tree` class and the unused `func_1()` function make the program deviate from the straightforward and expected approach.
