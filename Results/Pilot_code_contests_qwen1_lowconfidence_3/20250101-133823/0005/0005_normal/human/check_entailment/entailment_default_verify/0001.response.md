Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not correctly compute the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points. The output hints provide additional context about the function `func_1`, which is not directly related to the core logic of calculating the distances between points. However, even if the `func_1` function were corrected and did not affect the core logic, the provided code still fails to implement the required algorithm correctly. Specifically, the logic within the `query` and `update` methods of the `order_tree` class is not correctly implemented to achieve the desired result of calculating the minimum distances between points over all possible moments of time. The provided code uses a segment tree, but the implementation does not handle the calculation of the minimum distances as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
