Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points. The main issues are:

1. The `order_tree` class is not used correctly for the problem at hand. The `query` and `update` methods are designed for range queries and updates on a segment tree, but the problem requires calculating pairwise distances based on the relative positions and speeds of the points.

2. The logic inside the `query` and `update` methods does not relate to the problem's requirements. Specifically, the `query` method sums values from the segment tree without considering the distances between points.

3. The `update` method updates values in the segment tree based on the coordinates, but this does not help in calculating the minimum distances between points over time.

4. The final calculation of `ans` does not account for the relative speeds and positions of the points correctly. It seems to be trying to accumulate something but does not actually compute the minimum distances.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem's requirements and thus is incorrect.
