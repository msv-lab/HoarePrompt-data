You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n points on a coordinate axis OX. The i-th point is located at the integer point x_i and has a speed v_i. It is guaranteed that no two points occupy the same coordinate. All n points move with the constant speed, the coordinate of the i-th point at the moment t (t can be non-integer) is calculated as x_i + t ⋅ v_i.

Consider two points i and j. Let d(i, j) be the minimum possible distance between these two points over any possible moments of time (even non-integer). It means that if two points i and j coincide at some moment, the value d(i, j) will be 0.

Your task is to calculate the value ∑_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} d(i, j) (the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points).

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of points.

The second line of the input contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^8), where x_i is the initial coordinate of the i-th point. It is guaranteed that all x_i are distinct.

The third line of the input contains n integers v_1, v_2, ..., v_n (-10^8 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^8), where v_i is the speed of the i-th point.

Output

Print one integer — the value ∑_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} d(i, j) (the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly compute the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points. Specifically, the program seems to be using a segment tree to track the cumulative distance, but the logic within the `query` and `update` methods is not correctly implemented to achieve the desired result. 

The main issues are:
1. The `query` method does not correctly calculate the minimum distance between points.
2. The `update` method does not properly handle the update of distances for each point.

To verify this, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
3
1 3 2
-100 2 3

Expected Output:
3
```

The expected output is correct, but the provided program does not handle the general case correctly. For instance, in the given example, the program should calculate the distances as follows:
- Distance between points (1, -100, 1) and (3, 2, 3): \(d((1, -100, 1), (3, 2, 3)) = |1 + (-100)t - (3 + 2t)| = |1 - 3 - 102t| = |-2 - 102t|\)
- Distance between points (1, -100, 1) and (2, 3, 3): \(d((1, -100, 1), (2, 3, 3)) = |1 + (-100)t - (2 + 3t)| = |1 - 2 - 103t| = |-1 - 103t|\)
- Distance between points (3, 2, 3) and (2, 3, 3): \(d((3, 2, 3), (2, 3, 3)) = |3 + 2t - (2 + 3t)| = |3 - 2 - t| = |1 - t|\)

Summing these minimum distances gives 3, which matches the expected output. However, the provided program does not generalize this logic correctly for all pairs of points and all possible times. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    #The program returns a readline object from BytesIO containing the input data read from standard input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and it reads input from standard input (stdin). It then processes this input by first redirecting stdout to a BytesIO object. After processing, it registers a lambda function using `atexit` to write the content of the BytesIO object back to stdout. Finally, it returns a `readline` object from the BytesIO object containing the original input data read from stdin. However, there is a potential issue: the function does not actually read the input from stdin; instead, it attempts to read the current file size from stdin, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the file size is not correctly interpreted. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where stdin might be empty or where the file size cannot be determined correctly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
