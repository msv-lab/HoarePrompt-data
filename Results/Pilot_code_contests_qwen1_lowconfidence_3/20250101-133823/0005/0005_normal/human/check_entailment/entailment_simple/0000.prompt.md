You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are n points on a coordinate axis OX. The i-th point is located at the integer point x_i and has a speed v_i. It is guaranteed that no two points occupy the same coordinate. All n points move with the constant speed, the coordinate of the i-th point at the moment t (t can be non-integer) is calculated as x_i + t ⋅ v_i.

Consider two points i and j. Let d(i, j) be the minimum possible distance between these two points over any possible moments of time (even non-integer). It means that if two points i and j coincide at some moment, the value d(i, j) will be 0.

Your task is to calculate the value ∑_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} d(i, j) (the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points).

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of points.

The second line of the input contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^8), where x_i is the initial coordinate of the i-th point. It is guaranteed that all x_i are distinct.

The third line of the input contains n integers v_1, v_2, ..., v_n (-10^8 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^8), where v_i is the speed of the i-th point.

Output

Print one integer — the value ∑_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} d(i, j) (the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points).

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin
from collections import *

class order_tree:

    def __init__(self, arr):
        self.n = len(arr)
        self.tree = [[0, 0] for _ in range(self.n * 2)]
        self.order = defaultdict(int, {arr[i]: i for i in range(self.n)})

    def query(self, l):
        (res, coun) = (0, 0)
        l = self.order[l] + self.n
        r = self.n * 2
        while l < r:
            if l & 1:
                res += self.tree[l][0]
                coun += self.tree[l][1]
                l += 1
            if r & 1:
                r -= 1
                res += self.tree[r][0]
                coun += self.tree[r][1]
            l >>= 1
            r >>= 1
        return (res, coun)

    def update(self, ix, val):
        ix = self.n + self.order[ix]
        self.tree[ix][0] += val
        self.tree[ix][1] += 1
        while ix > 1:
            self.tree[ix >> 1][0] = self.tree[ix][0] + self.tree[ix ^ 1][0]
            self.tree[ix >> 1][1] = self.tree[ix][1] + self.tree[ix ^ 1][1]
            ix >>= 1
input = func_1()
rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in input().split()]
(n, a) = (int(input()), sorted(map(lambda x, y: [x, y], rints(), rints())))
dis = sorted(set([x[1] for x in a]))
(tree, ans) = (order_tree(dis), 0)
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    (su, coun) = tree.query(a[i][1])
    ans += su - coun * a[i][0]
    tree.update(a[i][1], a[i][0])
print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The second line contains a list of n integers x_i, where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^8 and all x_i are distinct. The third line contains a list of n integers v_i, where -10^8 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^8.
def func_1():
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    #The program returns a readline object from BytesIO containing the input data read from standard input

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
