Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the function `func_1()` attempts to redirect the input reading process and then process the input data. However, this redirection and processing mechanism does not contribute to solving the main problem of calculating the sum of minimum distances between all pairs of points over any possible moments of time.

The main logic to solve the problem is missing. The code snippet provided does not contain the necessary logic to compute the minimum distance `d(i, j)` for each pair of points and sum these distances. Instead, it focuses on reading and processing input in an unusual way, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

To solve the problem correctly, one would need to:
1. Calculate the relative positions of points considering their speeds.
2. Sort the points based on their relative positions.
3. Compute the minimum distances for each pair of points and sum them up.

The current implementation does not address these steps, making the code incorrect for the given problem description.
