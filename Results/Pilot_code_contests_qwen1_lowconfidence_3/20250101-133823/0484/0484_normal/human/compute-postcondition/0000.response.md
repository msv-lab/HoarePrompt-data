Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop is structured as `for _ in range(int(input()))`.
   - This means the loop will run for a number of times equal to the integer input from the user.

2. **Initial State**:
   - We are given that `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\).
   - For each test case (iteration of the loop), `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 1000\).

3. **Determining the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs based on the integer input from the user.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if and only if the input is a positive integer.

4. **Modifying the Initial State**:
   - The initial state is given as `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\).
   - To ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that the user inputs a positive integer.

5. **Final Adjusted State**:
   - The loop will execute if the input is a positive integer. Since `T` is already within the range \(1 \leq T \leq 100\), we can assume the user will provide a valid input.
   - However, to be more precise, we should state that the input must be a positive integer.

### Final Answer

State: **`T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\), and the user must provide a positive integer as input for the loop to execute.**

This ensures that the loop will execute as intended based on the given conditions.
