The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it seems to process multiple test cases where each test case contains two integers `n` and `k`. The constraints for these integers are that `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1000` and there are `1 ≤ T ≤ 100` test cases.

Given the provided output cases, it appears the function processes these test cases and returns different outputs based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept multiple test cases with integers `n` and `k` and return results based on specific conditions for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases where each test case contains integers `n` and `k`, and returns results based on specific conditions for each test case.**
