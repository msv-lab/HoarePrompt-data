The code prints the length of the list `ans` and the elements of `ans` joined into a single string separated by spaces. Since the printing operation does not affect the values of the variables, the values of `T`, `n`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq T \leq 100\)
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `k` is the second integer from the input
- `ans` is the list containing numbers from 1 to `k // 2 + 1` followed by numbers from `k + 1` to `n + 1`

The output will include:
- The length of `ans`, which is calculated as `k // 2 + 1 + (n + 1 - k - 1) = n - k // 2 + 2`
- The elements of `ans` printed as a space-separated string

Output State: **`T` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq T \leq 100\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, and `ans` is the list containing numbers from 1 to `k // 2 + 1` followed by numbers from `k + 1` to `n + 1`; the length of `ans` is `n - k // 2 + 2`, and the elements of `ans` are printed as a space-separated string**
