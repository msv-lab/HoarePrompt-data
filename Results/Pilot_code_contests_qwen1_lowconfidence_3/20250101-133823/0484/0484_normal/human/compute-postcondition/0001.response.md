`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split into integers using `map(int, stdin.readline().split())`. This means that `n` and `k` take the first and second integers from the input respectively. The value of `T` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input.**
