You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two integers n and k. You are asked to choose maximum number of distinct integers from 1 to n so that there is no subset of chosen numbers with sum equal to k.

A subset of a set is a set that can be obtained from initial one by removing some (possibly all or none) elements of it.

Input

The first line contains the number of test cases T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100).

Each of the next T lines contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the description of test cases.

Output

For each test case output two lines. In the first line output a single integer m — the number of chosen integers.

In the second line output m distinct integers from 1 to n — the chosen numbers.

If there are multiple answers, print any. You can print the numbers in any order.

Example

Input


3
3 2
5 3
1 1


Output


2
3 1 
3
4 5 2 
0
Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        ans = [x for x in range(1, k // 2 + 1)] + [x for x in range(k + 1, n + 1)]
        print('%d\n%s' % (len(ans), ' '.join(map(str, ans))))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider subsets that might sum up to \(k\) within the chosen set of numbers. For instance, consider the test case \(n = 5\) and \(k = 3\). The provided solution outputs \([4, 5, 2]\), but this set includes the number 2, which can form a subset \([2]\) that sums up to 2, not 3. Therefore, the program does not ensure that there is no subset of the chosen numbers with a sum equal to \(k\).

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs a list `ans` containing numbers from 1 to `k // 2 + 1` followed by numbers from `k + 1` to `n`. The length of `ans` is `n - k // 2 + 2`. It then prints the length of `ans` followed by its elements as a space-separated string. The function accepts an integer `T` indicating the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq T \leq 100\). If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the constructed list `ans` will only contain numbers from 1 to `n`. If `k` is exactly half of `n`, the list `ans` will contain the first half of numbers from 1 to `n` excluding `k`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `k == n`, the constructed list `ans` will simply be a sequence from 1 to `n`.
- The function correctly handles the case where `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, but no explicit check is mentioned in the annotation for this scenario. However, the code inherently covers this case by stopping the range generation when `x` reaches `n+1`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
