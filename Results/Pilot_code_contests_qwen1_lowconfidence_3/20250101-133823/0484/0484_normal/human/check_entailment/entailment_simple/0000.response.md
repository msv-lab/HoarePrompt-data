Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( T \) and then processes each test case by reading pairs of integers \( n \) and \( k \). This matches the requirement that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 1000 \).

2. **Choosing Chosen Numbers**:
   - For each test case, the program constructs a list `ans` by selecting numbers from 1 to \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) and from \( k + 1 \) to \( n \).
   - This ensures that no subset of these chosen numbers can sum up to \( k \):
     - Any subset containing numbers from \( 1 \) to \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) cannot sum up to \( k \) because the largest possible sum would be less than \( k \).
     - Any subset containing numbers from \( k + 1 \) to \( n \) cannot sum up to \( k \) because all these numbers are greater than \( k \).

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs the number of chosen integers \( m \) in the first line.
   - It then prints the chosen numbers in the second line, separated by spaces.
   - The output format matches the problem description exactly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases appropriately:
     - If \( k = 1 \), the list `ans` will be `[2, 3, ..., n]`.
     - If \( k = n \), the list `ans` will be `[1, 2, ..., k-1]`.
   - The program correctly handles these scenarios without any issues.

Since the program adheres to the problem description and handles all possible cases as specified, the correctness is True.
