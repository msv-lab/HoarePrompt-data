You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two integers n and k. You are asked to choose maximum number of distinct integers from 1 to n so that there is no subset of chosen numbers with sum equal to k.

A subset of a set is a set that can be obtained from initial one by removing some (possibly all or none) elements of it.

Input

The first line contains the number of test cases T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100).

Each of the next T lines contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the description of test cases.

Output

For each test case output two lines. In the first line output a single integer m — the number of chosen integers.

In the second line output m distinct integers from 1 to n — the chosen numbers.

If there are multiple answers, print any. You can print the numbers in any order.

Example

Input


3
3 2
5 3
1 1


Output


2
3 1 
3
4 5 2 
0
Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        ans = [x for x in range(1, k // 2 + 1)] + [x for x in range(k + 1, n + 1)]
        print('%d\n%s' % (len(ans), ' '.join(map(str, ans))))


```
Output hints: The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs a list `ans` containing numbers from 1 to `k // 2 + 1` followed by numbers from `k + 1` to `n`. The length of `ans` is `n - k // 2 + 2`. It then prints the length of `ans` followed by its elements as a space-separated string. The function accepts an integer `T` indicating the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq T \leq 100\). If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the constructed list `ans` will only contain numbers from 1 to `n`. If `k` is exactly half of `n`, the list `ans` will contain the first half of numbers from 1 to `n` excluding `k`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `k == n`, the constructed list `ans` will simply be a sequence from 1 to `n`.
- The function correctly handles the case where `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, but no explicit check is mentioned in the annotation for this scenario. However, the code inherently covers this case by stopping the range generation when `x` reaches `n+1`.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
