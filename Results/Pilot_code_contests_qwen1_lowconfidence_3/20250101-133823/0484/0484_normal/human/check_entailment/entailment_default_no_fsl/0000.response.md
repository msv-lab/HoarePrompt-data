Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the code does not ensure that no subset of the chosen numbers sums to `k`. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  5 4 1
  ```

However, the current implementation outputs:
  ```
  3
  5 4 2
  ```

This is because the code simply selects numbers from 1 to `k // 2 + 1` and from `k + 1` to `n`, which does not guarantee that no subset of the chosen numbers sums to `k`. For `n = 5` and `k = 3`, selecting `{5, 4, 2}` includes a subset `{2}` which sums to `2`, and `{5, 4}` which sums to `9`, but does not include a subset that sums to `3`.

To fix this, the code needs to implement a more sophisticated algorithm to ensure that no subset of the chosen numbers sums to `k`. One approach could be using a backtracking or dynamic programming method to construct the subset.
