Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code constructs a list `ans` that includes numbers from `1` to `k // 2 + 1` and from `k + 1` to `n`. This construction does not guarantee that there is no subset of chosen numbers with a sum equal to `k`.

Consider the following case:
- For `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the code constructs the list `[1, 2, 4, 5]`. However, the subset `{1, 2}` has a sum of `3`, which is equal to `k`. Therefore, the solution is not valid for this case.

The code fails to ensure that no subset of the chosen numbers sums to `k`. Thus, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
