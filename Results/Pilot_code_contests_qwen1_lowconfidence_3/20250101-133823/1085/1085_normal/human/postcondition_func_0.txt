The function processes \(n\) pairs of integers \((x_i, y_i)\) where \(n\) is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\) and each pair satisfies \(|x_i|, |y_i| \leq 10^9\). It counts the occurrences of each \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) separately and together. Specifically, it calculates the number of unique \(x_i\) values, the number of unique \(y_i\) values, and the number of pairs \((x_i, y_i)\) that occur more than once. The function then computes a result based on these counts using the formula \((count - 1) * count / 2\) for both unique \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) values and subtracts the contribution of pairs that occur more than once. Finally, it prints the computed result. Potential edge cases include the minimum and maximum values of \(n\) and the range of \(x_i\) and \(y_i\), which are handled within the given constraints.
