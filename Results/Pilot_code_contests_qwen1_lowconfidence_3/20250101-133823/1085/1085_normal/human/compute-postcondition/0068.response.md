Postcondition: ***`ans` is the initial value of `ans` minus \((posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2\), `rows` remains unchanged from its original state, and `cols` remains unchanged from its original state. Since there is no else part, the postcondition of the if part directly applies when the condition `posi[t] > 1` is true.***
