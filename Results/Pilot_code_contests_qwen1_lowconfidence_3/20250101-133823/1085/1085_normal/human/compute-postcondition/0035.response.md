`rows[x]` is assigned the value `1`. This means that the value of `rows[x]` is now `1`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `posi`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `n`; `x` is the first integer input; `y` is the second integer input; if `(x, y)` is in `posi`, then `posi[(x, y)]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `posi[(x, y)]` is set to 1; `rows[x]` is equal to `1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `n`; `x` is the first integer input; `y` is the second integer input; if `(x, y)` is in `posi`, then `posi[(x, y)]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `posi[(x, y)]` is set to 1; `rows[x]` is equal to `1`**
