Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input. If `(x, y)` is in `posi`, `posi[(x, y)]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `posi[(x, y)]` is set to 1. Additionally, `rows[x]` is set to 1, and `cols[y]` is incremented by 1.***

Explanation:
- The precondition states that `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, and the initial state of `posi[(x, y)]` is either 1 (if `(x, y)` is in `posi`) or 0 (if `(x, y)` is not in `posi`).
- If `(x, y)` is in `posi`, then `posi[(x, y)]` is incremented by 1. If `(x, y)` is not in `posi`, then `posi[(x, y)]` is set to 1.
- Regardless of whether `(x, y)` is in `posi` or not, `rows[x]` is set to 1 and `cols[y]` is incremented by 1 (or set to 1 if not already incremented).

Therefore, the overall postcondition summarizes these actions as stated above.
