The code `n = int(raw_input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000`, this assignment does not change the constraints on `n`, but it does assign the specific integer input to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input within the range 1 to 200 000**
