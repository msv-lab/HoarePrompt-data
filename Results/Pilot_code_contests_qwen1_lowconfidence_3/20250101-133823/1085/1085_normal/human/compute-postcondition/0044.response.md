The code `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `posi`, `rows`, or `cols`. Therefore, the output state will include these variables with their original values, and `ans` will be set to 0.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `x` is the last integer input, `y` is the last integer input, `ans` is 0, if `(x, y)` is in `posi`, then `posi[(x, y)]` is the count of occurrences of `(x, y)`, otherwise `rows[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` and `cols[y]` is the count of occurrences of `y`, and `posi[(x, y)]` is 1.**
