`rows[x]` is incremented by 1. Given that `x` is an input integer, the exact value of `rows[x]` depends on the value of `x`. However, we know the following from the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n-1`
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer

If `(x, y)` is in `posi`, then `posi[(x, y)]` is incremented by 1; if `(x, y)` is not in `posi`, then `rows[x]` is set to 1, `cols[y]` is incremented by 1, and `posi[(x, y)]` is 1.

Since `rows[x]` is incremented by 1 regardless of whether `(x, y)` is in `posi` or not, the output state will be:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n-1`
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer
- `rows[x]` is 1 (because `rows[x]` was set to 1 when `x` is an input integer, and then incremented by 1)

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `rows[x]` is 1**
