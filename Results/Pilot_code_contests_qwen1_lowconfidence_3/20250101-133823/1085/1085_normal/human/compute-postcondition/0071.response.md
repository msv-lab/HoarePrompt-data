The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. The problem statement describes constraints and relationships for an input that is not part of the function's definition but rather provided externally. The function is expected to process data according to these constraints.

Given the constraints and relationships for the input:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\).
- Each of the following `n` lines contains two integers \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) such that \(|x_i|, |y_i| \leq 10^9\).

The function's output is not specified in the given information. However, based on the structure provided, the function will read and process `n` pairs of integers from external input.

Functionality: **The function processes `n` pairs of integers `(x_i, y_i)` where `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\) and each pair satisfies \(|x_i|, |y_i| \leq 10^9\).**
