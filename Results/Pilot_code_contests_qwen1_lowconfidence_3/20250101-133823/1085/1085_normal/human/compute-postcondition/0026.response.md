The code `cols[y] += 1` increments the value of `cols[y]` by 1. Since `y` is an input integer from the initial state, the only thing that changes is the value of `cols[y]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `cols[y]` is incremented by 1.**
