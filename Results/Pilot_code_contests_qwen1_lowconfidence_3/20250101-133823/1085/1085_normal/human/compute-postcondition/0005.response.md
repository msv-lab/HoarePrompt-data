The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. Since the input is split using spaces, `x` and `y` will be integers. The initial state says `n` must be greater than 0, which remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**
