The code `ans = ans + (cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding to it the value of \((cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2\). The variables `rows` and `t` remain unchanged, and `cols` must still have more keys left to process.

Let's denote the initial value of `ans` as \( A \), the value of `cols[t]` as \( C \).

Then, the new value of `ans` will be:
\[ A + (C - 1) \times C / 2 \]

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is \( A + (C - 1) \times C / 2 \).

Output State: **`ans` is the original value of `ans` plus \((cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2\), `rows` remains unchanged, `t` is the next key in `cols`, and `cols` must still have more keys left to process.**
