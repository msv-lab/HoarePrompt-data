Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**: The loop iterates over the keys of the dictionary `rows`. Therefore, the key condition for the loop to execute is that the `rows` dictionary must contain at least one key.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `x` is the last integer input.
   - `y` is the last integer input.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - If `(x, y)` is in `posi`, then `posi[(x, y)]` is the count of occurrences of `(x, y)`, otherwise `rows[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` and `cols[y]` is the count of occurrences of `y`, and `posi[(x, y)]` is 1.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, the `rows` dictionary must have at least one key. This ensures there is something to iterate over.
   - Since `rows` is involved, no other variable states need adjustment as they are not directly related to the loop's execution based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the required state to adjust for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`rows` must have at least one key**
