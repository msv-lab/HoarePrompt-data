According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the keys in the `rows` dictionary. For the loop to execute again, `rows` must have at least two keys. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` has been updated by adding \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) to its current value, and `rows` must have at least two keys.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider:
1. The current value of `ans`.
2. The condition for the loop to continue, which requires `rows` to have at least two keys.

Since the problem does not specify the exact number of keys in `rows` or the exact value of `ans` at the end of the previous iteration, we can only state the minimum requirement for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`ans` has a value that includes the addition of \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) for some key \(t\), and `rows` must have at least two keys**.
