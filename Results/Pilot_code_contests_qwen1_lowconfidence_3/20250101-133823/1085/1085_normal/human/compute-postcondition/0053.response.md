The initial state is that `ans` is the sum of \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) for all keys \( t \) in `rows`, and `rows` remains unchanged from its original state. The code snippet adds \((cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2\) to `ans`.

Since `cols` must have at least one key, let's denote the key by `t`. The value of `ans` will be updated by adding \((cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2\) to its current value.

Output State: **`ans` is the sum of \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) for all keys \( t \) in `rows` plus \((cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2\), and `rows` remains unchanged from its original state**
