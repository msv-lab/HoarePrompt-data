According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `rows`. For the loop to execute again, `rows` must have at least two keys. At the end of the last iteration, `rows` must have at least one key, and `ans` is updated by adding \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) to its current value.

To proceed to the next iteration, we need to ensure that `rows` has at least two keys. The loop will then increment `t` to the next key in `rows`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect that `rows` must have at least two keys and `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `t`.

State: **`rows` must have at least two keys, `ans` is updated by adding \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) to its current value**
