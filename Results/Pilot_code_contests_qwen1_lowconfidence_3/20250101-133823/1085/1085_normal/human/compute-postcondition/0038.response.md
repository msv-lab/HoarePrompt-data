`cols[y]` is assigned the value 1. This means that the column index `y` is marked as having been accessed. The value of `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `posi`, and `rows` remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `posi[(x, y)]` is incremented by 1 or set to 1 if `(x, y)` is not already in `posi`, `rows[x]` is set to 1, and `cols[y]` is 1.**
