The code `rows[x] += 1` increments the value of `rows[x]` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `x` is an integer input, and `rows` is a dictionary where the key is `x` and the value is initially 0 (since no specific initial value for `rows` is mentioned). Therefore, the value of `rows[x]` will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `n`; `x` is the first integer input; `y` is the second integer input; if (x, y) is in `posi`, then `posi[(x, y)]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `posi[(x, y)]` is set to 1; `rows[x]` is 1**
