Let's analyze the loop and determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished executing.

### Initial State:
- \( n \) is a non-negative integer.
- \( i \) is \( n \).
- \( x \) is the last integer input.
- \( y \) is the last integer input.
- \( ans \) is 0.
- \( rows \) is a dictionary where the keys are integers and the values are counts of occurrences of those integers.
- \( cols \) is a dictionary where the keys are integers and the values are counts of occurrences of those integers.
- \( posi \) is a dictionary where each key is a tuple \((x, y)\) and the value is the count of occurrences of that tuple.

### Loop Code:
```python
for t in rows.keys():
    ans = ans + (rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Iteration**:
   - The loop starts by iterating over the keys in the `rows` dictionary.
   - For each key \( t \), the expression \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) is added to `ans`.
   - After the first iteration, `ans` is updated by adding the first term \((rows[t_1] - 1) * rows[t_1] / 2\).

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - The loop continues to iterate over the remaining keys in `rows`.
   - For the second key \( t_2 \), the expression \((rows[t_2] - 1) * rows[t_2] / 2\) is added to `ans`.
   - After the second iteration, `ans` is updated by adding the second term \((rows[t_2] - 1) * rows[t_2] / 2\).

3. **General Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over all keys in `rows`.
   - For each key \( t_i \), the expression \((rows[t_i] - 1) * rows[t_i] / 2\) is added to `ans`.

4. **Final State**:
   - After the loop has finished executing, `ans` will be the sum of \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) for all keys \( t \) in the `rows` dictionary.
   - The `rows` dictionary remains unchanged from its original state because the loop only updates `ans` and does not modify `rows` directly.

### Conclusion:
- If the loop executes at least once, `ans` will be the sum of \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) for all keys \( t \) in `rows`.
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., `rows` is an empty dictionary), `ans` will remain 0.

### Output State:
Output State: **`ans` is the sum of \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) for all keys \( t \) in `rows`, and `rows` remains unchanged from its original state.**
