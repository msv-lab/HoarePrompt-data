`cols[y]` is assigned the value 1. The value of `y` is an input integer, so `cols[y]` is set to 1. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are unchanged, and the condition related to `rows` does not affect the current output since no value of `x` is specified to check against `rows`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer; `cols[y]` is 1**
