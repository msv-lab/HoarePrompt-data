`rows[x]` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `x` is an input integer, so `rows[x]` is now `1`. The value of `n` remains greater than 0, and `y` remains an input integer. The condition that `x` is not in `rows` is no longer valid since `x` is now in `rows`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, and `rows[x]` is 1**
