`ans` is initially calculated as the sum of \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) for all keys \( t \) in `rows` plus \((cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2\) for all keys \( t \) in `cols`. The value of `posi` remains unchanged from its original state, and the current value of `t` in `posi` is such that `posi[t]` is greater than 1.

The code snippet `ans -= (posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2` subtracts \((posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2\) from `ans`.

Since the exact values of `rows`, `cols`, and `posi` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans` after the subtraction. However, we know that `ans` has been updated by subtracting the value \((posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2\).

Output State: **`ans` is now `ans` - \((posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2\), `rows` remains unchanged from its original state, `cols` remains unchanged from its original state, `posi` must have at least one key, and the current value of `t` in `posi` is such that `posi[t]` is greater than 1**.
