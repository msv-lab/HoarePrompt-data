Let's break down the given information and the for loop statement step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `ans` is the sum of \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) for all keys \( t \) in `rows` plus \((cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2\) for all keys \( t \) in `cols`.
- `rows` remains unchanged from its original state.
- The for loop iterates over the keys in `posi`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `ans`:**
   - The value of `ans` is calculated based on the initial state of `rows` and `cols`. Therefore, `ans` should not be adjusted since its value is already determined.
   
2. **Dictionary `rows`:**
   - `rows` is mentioned to remain unchanged from its original state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `rows`.

3. **Dictionary `posi`:**
   - The for loop iterates over the keys in `posi`. For the loop to execute, `posi` must contain at least one key. 

4. **Variable `t`:**
   - In each iteration of the loop, `t` takes the value of the current key in `posi`. Since we don't know the exact keys or their values, we need to ensure that there is at least one key in `posi`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `posi` contains at least one key.

### Final Answer:
State: **`ans` is the sum of \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) for all keys \( t \) in `rows` plus \((cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2\) for all keys \( t \) in `cols`, `rows` remains unchanged from its original state, `posi` must have at least one key.**
