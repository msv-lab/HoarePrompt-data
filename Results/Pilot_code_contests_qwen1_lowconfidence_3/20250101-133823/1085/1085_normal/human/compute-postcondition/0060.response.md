Postcondition: **`ans` is the sum of \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) for all keys \( t \) in `rows` plus \((cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2\) for all keys \( t \) in `cols`, `rows` remains unchanged from its original state, `posi` must have at least one key, and the current value of `t` in `posi` is such that posi[t] is greater than 1**
