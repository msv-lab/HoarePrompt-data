The code `cols[y] += 1` increments the value of `cols[y]` by 1. Given that `y` is the second integer input, and initially `cols[y]` could be 0 (if no prior increment), the value of `cols[y]` will be updated to 1.

All other variables (`n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `posi`, and `rows[x]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `posi[(x, y)]` is incremented by 1 or set to 1, `rows[x]` is set to 1, `cols[y]` is incremented by 1.**
