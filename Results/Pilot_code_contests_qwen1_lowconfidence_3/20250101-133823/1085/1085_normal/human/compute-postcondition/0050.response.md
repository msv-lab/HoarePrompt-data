`ans` is initially set to include the addition of \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) for some key \(t\). The code updates `ans` by adding \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) to its current value. Since the initial value of `ans` is already \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\), adding this same expression again results in doubling the initial value of `ans`.

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is \(2 * ((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2)\), which simplifies to \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t]\).

Output State: **`ans` is \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t]\), `rows` must have at least two keys**
