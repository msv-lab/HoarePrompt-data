`rows[x]` is incremented by 1. The value of `x` is in `rows`, so `rows[x]` is increased by 1. The values of `n` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, and the current value of `x` is in `rows`; `rows[x]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, and the current value of `x` is in `rows`; `rows[x]` is increased by 1**
