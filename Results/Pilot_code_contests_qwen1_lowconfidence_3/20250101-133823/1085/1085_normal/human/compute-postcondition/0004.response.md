According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Given the initial state where `n` is an integer input within the range 1 to 200,000, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to start executing.

The other variables (`rows`, `cols`, `posi`) are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute, but they might be used inside the loop. However, since the problem asks specifically about adjusting the state for the loop to execute, we focus on `n`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
