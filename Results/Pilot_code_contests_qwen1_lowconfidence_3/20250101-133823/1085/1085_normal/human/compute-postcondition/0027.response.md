The code `cols[y] = 1` sets the value of `cols[y]` to 1. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `x`, or `y`. However, the initial conditions provided state that if `(x, y)` was in `posi`, then `posi[(x, y)]` would have been incremented by 1, and if `(x, y)` was not in `posi`, then `rows[x]` would have been set to 1, `cols[y]` would have been incremented by 1, and `posi[(x, y)]` would have been set to 1.

Given that `cols[y]` is explicitly set to 1 in this line of code, it means that `(x, y)` was not in `posi` during the previous operations (or that state has been reset), and thus `rows[x]` remains unchanged. The value of `cols[y]` is now 1, regardless of its previous state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `cols[y]` is 1**
