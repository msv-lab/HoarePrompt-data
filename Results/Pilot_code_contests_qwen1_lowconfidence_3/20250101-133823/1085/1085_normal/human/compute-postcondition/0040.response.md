The code `posi[x, y] += 1` increments the value of `posi[x, y]` by 1. Given the initial state, `posi[(x, y)]` is either incremented by 1 if `(x, y)` is in `posi`, or set to 1 if `(x, y)` is not in `posi`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `rows[x]`, and `cols[y]`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `n`; `x` is the first integer input; `y` is the second integer input; `posi[(x, y)]` is incremented by 1 if `(x, y)` is in `posi`, or set to 1 if `(x, y)` is not in `posi`; `rows[x]` is set to 1; `cols[y]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `n`; `x` is the first integer input; `y` is the second integer input; `posi[(x, y)]` is incremented by 1 if `(x, y)` is in `posi`, or set to 1 if `(x, y)` is not in `posi`; `rows[x]` is set to 1; `cols[y]` is incremented by 1.**
