The code snippet `x, y = [int(t) for t in raw_input().split(' ')]` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. This means that `x` and `y` are now specific integer values entered by the user. The variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states, and the dictionary `posi` is updated based on the new values of `x` and `y`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is equal to `n`
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer
- If `(x, y)` is in `posi`, then `posi[(x, y)]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `posi[(x, y)]` is set to 1.

After executing the code, the following updates occur:
- `x` is assigned the first integer input
- `y` is assigned the second integer input
- `n` remains greater than 0
- `i` remains equal to `n`
- `posi` is updated based on the new values of `x` and `y`

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `n`; `x` is the first integer input; `y` is the second integer input; if (x, y) is in `posi`, then `posi[(x, y)]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `posi[(x, y)]` is set to 1.**
