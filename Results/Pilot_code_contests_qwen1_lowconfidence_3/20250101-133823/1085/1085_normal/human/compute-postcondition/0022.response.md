The code snippet `x, y = [int(t) for t in raw_input().split(' ')]` reads two integers from the input, splits them by space, and converts each to an integer, assigning them to `x` and `y`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- If `(x, y)` is in `posi`, then `posi[(x, y)]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `rows[x]` is set to 1, `cols[y]` is incremented by 1, and `posi[(x, y)]` is set to 1.
- `i` must be `n-1`.

After the code executes:
- `x` and `y` are assigned the integer values from the input.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `rows`, `cols`, and `posi` are updated according to the conditions.

Since no changes are made to `n` or `i`, their values remain unchanged. `x` and `y` are now specific integer values read from input. The values of `rows`, `cols`, and `posi` are updated based on the conditions provided.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, if `(x, y)` is in `posi`, then `posi[(x, y)]` is incremented by 1; if `(x, y)` is not in `posi`, then `rows[x]` is set to 1, `cols[y]` is incremented by 1, and `posi[(x, y)]` is 1.**
