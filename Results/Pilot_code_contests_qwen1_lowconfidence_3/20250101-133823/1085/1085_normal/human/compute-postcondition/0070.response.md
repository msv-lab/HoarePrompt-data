The code `print(ans)` prints the value of `ans`. Since the value of `ans` is determined by the initial state minus the sum of \((posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2\) for all keys \( t \) in `posi` such that `posi[t] > 1`, the value of `ans` does not change after this line of code. The states of `rows` and `cols` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is the initial value of `ans` minus the sum of \((posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2\) for all keys \( t \) in `posi` such that `posi[t] > 1`, `rows` remains unchanged from its original state, and `cols` remains unchanged from its original state.

Output State: **`ans` is the initial value of `ans` minus the sum of \((posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2\) for all keys \( t \) in `posi` such that `posi[t] > 1`, `rows` remains unchanged from its original state, and `cols` remains unchanged from its original state.**
