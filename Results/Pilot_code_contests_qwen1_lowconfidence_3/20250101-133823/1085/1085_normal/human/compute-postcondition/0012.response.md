`cols[y]` is incremented by 1. Given that `y` is in `cols`, the value of `cols[y]` will be increased by 1. The initial state of `n` being greater than 0, `x` being an input integer, `y` being an input integer, and the conditions regarding `rows` and `cols` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `rows[x]` is increased by 1 if `x` was already in `rows`, otherwise `rows[x]` is set to 1, `cols[y]` is increased by 1**
