`posi[x, y]` is assigned the value of `posi[x, y] + 1`. Given that `x` is an input integer and `y` is an input integer, the value of `posi[x, y]` will be incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `posi[x, y]` is incremented by 1**
