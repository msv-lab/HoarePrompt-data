Postcondition: ***`ans` is the sum of \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) for all keys \( t \) in `rows` plus \((cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2\) for all keys \( t \) in `cols`, `rows` remains unchanged from its original state, `cols` remains unchanged from its original state, `posi` must have at least one key, and if the current value of `t` in `posi` is such that `posi[t]` is greater than 1, then `ans` is updated by subtracting \((posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2\). Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
