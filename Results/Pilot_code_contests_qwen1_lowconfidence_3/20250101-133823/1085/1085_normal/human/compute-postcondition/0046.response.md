The code updates the value of `ans` by adding the expression `(rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2` to its current value. However, the initial value of `ans` is not specified in the initial state, and the value of `t` is also not given. Therefore, we can only state that `ans` is updated by the given expression, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rows` must have at least one key; `ans` is updated by adding \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) to its current value**
