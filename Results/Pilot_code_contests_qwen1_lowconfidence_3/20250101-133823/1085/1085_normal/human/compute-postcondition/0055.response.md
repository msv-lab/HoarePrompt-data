The initial state is defined such that `ans` is the sum of \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) for all keys \( t \) in `rows` plus \((cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2\) up to the current key `t` plus the contribution from the next key in `cols`. The variable `rows` remains unchanged, and `t` is the next key in `cols`.

The code snippet updates `ans` by adding \((cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2\).

Since `cols[t]` is part of the calculation and there is no specific value given for `cols[t]`, let's denote the value of `cols[t]` as `c`. Therefore, the updated `ans` will be:

\[ ans = \text{original value of } ans + (c - 1) * c / 2 \]

The output state after the code execution is:
Output State: **`ans` is the original value of `ans` plus \((cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2\), `rows` remains unchanged, and `t` is the next key in `cols`.**
