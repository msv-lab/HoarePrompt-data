Postcondition: ***`ans` is the initial value of `ans` minus \((posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2\), where `t` is the next key in `posi` after the previous key and `posi[t] > 1`; `rows` remains unchanged from its original state; `cols` remains unchanged from its original state; `posi` must have at least one key.***
