The code `ans -= (posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2` impacts the variable `ans` by subtracting the value \((posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2\) from `ans`. Here, `t` is the next key in `posi` after the previous key, and `posi[t]` must be greater than 1 for the subtraction to occur.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is the sum of \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) for all keys \( t \) in `rows` plus \((cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2\) for all keys \( t \) in `cols`.
- `rows` and `cols` remain unchanged.
- `posi` must have at least one key, and if the current value of `t` in `posi` is such that `posi[t]` is greater than 1, then `ans` is updated.

After the code is executed, `ans` is updated by subtracting \((posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2\), where `t` is the next key in `posi` after the previous key and `posi[t] > 1`.

Output State: **`ans` is the initial value of `ans` minus \((posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2\), where `t` is the next key in `posi` after the previous key and `posi[t] > 1`; `rows` remains unchanged from its original state; `cols` remains unchanged from its original state; `posi` must have at least one key.**
