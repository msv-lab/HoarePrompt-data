The code creates a new dictionary named `cols`. The previous value of `n` remains unchanged, and the previous value of `rows` (which was an empty dictionary) also remains unchanged. Therefore, the only changes are the creation of the `cols` dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input within the range 1 to 200,000; `rows` is an empty dictionary; `cols` is an empty dictionary**
