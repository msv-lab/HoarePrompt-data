`ans` is decreased by \((posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2\), where `t` is the current key in `posi` and `posi[t] > 1`. The values of `rows` and `cols` remain unchanged from their original state. The value of `ans` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`ans` is the initial value of `ans` minus \((posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2\), `rows` remains unchanged from its original state, `cols` remains unchanged from its original state, and `posi` must have at least one key.**
