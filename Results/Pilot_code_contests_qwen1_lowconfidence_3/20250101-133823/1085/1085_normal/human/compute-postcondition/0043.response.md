Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `x` is the last integer input, `y` is the last integer input. If `(x, y)` is in `posi`, then `posi[(x, y)]` is the count of occurrences of `(x, y)`. Otherwise, `rows[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` and `cols[y]` is the count of occurrences of `y`, and `posi[(x, y)]` is 1.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution:** The loop runs exactly `n` times, where `n` is a non-negative integer.
2. **Variable Updates:**
   - For each iteration, the values of `x` and `y` are updated based on the input.
   - The `posi` dictionary keeps track of the occurrences of the tuple `(x, y)`.
   - The `rows` dictionary keeps track of the occurrences of `x`.
   - The `cols` dictionary keeps track of the occurrences of `y`.

3. **Final Values:**
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n`.
   - `x` and `y` will be the values of the last input pair.
   - `posi[(x, y)]` will be the count of occurrences of `(x, y)`.
   - `rows[x]` will be the count of occurrences of `x`.
   - `cols[y]` will be the count of occurrences of `y`.

4. **Non-occurrence Case:**
   - If `(x, y)` is not in `posi`, then `posi[(x, y)]` is 1, indicating the first occurrence of `(x, y)`.
   - If `(x, y)` is in `posi`, then `posi[(x, y)]` is incremented by 1 for each subsequent occurrence of `(x, y)`.

This output state captures the final values and relationships of the variables after all iterations of the loop have completed.
