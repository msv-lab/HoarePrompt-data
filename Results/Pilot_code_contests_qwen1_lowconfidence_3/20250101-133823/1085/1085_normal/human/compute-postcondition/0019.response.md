`posi[x, y]` is assigned the value `1`. This means that the dictionary `posi` now contains the key `(x, y)` with the value `1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `x` is not in `rows`, `cols[y]` is incremented by 1, `posi[x, y]` is 1**
