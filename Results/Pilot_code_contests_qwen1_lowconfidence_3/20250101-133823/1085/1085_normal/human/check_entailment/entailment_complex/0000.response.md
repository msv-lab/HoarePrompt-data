Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of watchmen \( n \) and the coordinates \((x_i, y_i)\) for each watchman.
   - It ensures that the input is processed within the specified constraints: \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\) and \(|x_i|, |y_i| \leq 10^9\).

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The program uses three dictionaries (`rows`, `cols`, `posi`) to count the occurrences of each \( x \)-coordinate, each \( y \)-coordinate, and each pair \((x, y)\), respectively.
   - This step is crucial for calculating the number of pairs with the same Manhattan and Euclidean distances.

3. **Calculating the Number of Pairs**:
   - The program iterates over the keys in `rows` and `cols` to calculate the number of pairs with the same \( x \)-coordinates and \( y \)-coordinates, respectively.
   - For each key \( t \) in `rows` and `cols`, it uses the formula \((count - 1) * count / 2\) to compute the number of pairs for each unique \( x \)-coordinate and \( y \)-coordinate.
   - The result for unique \( x \)-coordinates and \( y \)-coordinates is accumulated in `ans`.

4. **Adjusting for Overlapping Pairs**:
   - The program then iterates over the keys in `posi` to adjust the count if a particular pair \((x, y)\) occurs more than once.
   - For each key \( t \) in `posi` where the count is greater than 1, it subtracts the contribution of overlapping pairs using the formula \((posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2\).
   - This adjustment ensures that pairs counted multiple times due to overlapping coordinates are not double-counted.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the computed result stored in `ans`.

The program correctly follows the problem description by:
- Reading the input as specified.
- Counting occurrences of coordinates and pairs.
- Applying the correct formulas to compute the number of pairs with the same Manhattan and Euclidean distances.
- Adjusting for overlapping pairs to avoid double-counting.
- Printing the final result.

Given the problem description and the assumptions about valid inputs, the program meets all the requirements and is therefore correct.
