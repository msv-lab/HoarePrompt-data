You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Watchmen are in a danger and Doctor Manhattan together with his friend Daniel Dreiberg should warn them as soon as possible. There are n watchmen on a plane, the i-th watchman is located at point (xi, yi).

They need to arrange a plan, but there are some difficulties on their way. As you know, Doctor Manhattan considers the distance between watchmen i and j to be |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|. Daniel, as an ordinary person, calculates the distance using the formula <image>.

The success of the operation relies on the number of pairs (i, j) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n), such that the distance between watchman i and watchmen j calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance between them calculated by Daniel. You were asked to compute the number of such pairs.

Input

The first line of the input contains the single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of watchmen.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 109).

Some positions may coincide.

Output

Print the number of pairs of watchmen such that the distance between them calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance calculated by Daniel.

Note

In the first sample, the distance between watchman 1 and watchman 2 is equal to |1 - 7| + |1 - 5| = 10 for Doctor Manhattan and <image> for Daniel. For pairs (1, 1), (1, 5) and (7, 5), (1, 5) Doctor Manhattan and Daniel will calculate the same distances.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    rows = {}
    cols = {}
    posi = {}
    for i in range(n):
        (x, y) = [int(t) for t in raw_input().split(' ')]
        if x in rows:
            rows[x] += 1
        else:
            rows[x] = 1
        if y in cols:
            cols[y] += 1
        else:
            cols[y] = 1
        if (x, y) in posi:
            posi[x, y] += 1
        else:
            posi[x, y] = 1
    ans = 0
    for t in rows.keys():
        ans = ans + (rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2
    for t in cols.keys():
        ans = ans + (cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2
    for t in posi.keys():
        if posi[t] > 1:
            ans -= (posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly count the number of pairs of watchmen such that the distance calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance calculated by Daniel. The issue lies in how the program calculates the number of pairs with the same Manhattan and Euclidean distances.

The program incorrectly adds the number of pairs based on individual coordinates and subtracts overlapping pairs. However, this approach does not account for the specific condition where the Manhattan distance equals the Euclidean distance. Specifically, the Manhattan distance \( |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j| \) equals the Euclidean distance \( \sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2} \) only when \( |x_i - x_j| = |y_i - y_j| \). 

To fix this, the program needs to specifically count pairs where the absolute differences in x-coordinates and y-coordinates are equal. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    pairs = {}
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = [int(t) for t in input().split(' ')]
        diff = abs(x - y)
        if diff in pairs:
            pairs[diff] += 1
        else:
            pairs[diff] = 1
    
    ans = 0
    for diff, count in pairs.items():
        if count > 1:
            # Number of ways to choose 2 out of count points
            ans += count * (count - 1) // 2
    
    print(ans)

func()
```

This version correctly counts the number of pairs by focusing on the difference between the x and y coordinates and using combinatorial counting to get the number of valid pairs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes \(n\) pairs of integers \((x_i, y_i)\) where \(n\) is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\) and each pair satisfies \(|x_i|, |y_i| \leq 10^9\). It counts the occurrences of each \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) separately and together. Specifically, it calculates the number of unique \(x_i\) values, the number of unique \(y_i\) values, and the number of pairs \((x_i, y_i)\) that occur more than once. The function then computes a result based on these counts using the formula \((count - 1) * count / 2\) for both unique \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) values and subtracts the contribution of pairs that occur more than once. Finally, it prints the computed result. Potential edge cases include the minimum and maximum values of \(n\) and the range of \(x_i\) and \(y_i\), which are handled within the given constraints.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
