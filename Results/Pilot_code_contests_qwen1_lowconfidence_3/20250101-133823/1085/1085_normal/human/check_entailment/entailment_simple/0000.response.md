Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the solution described in the problem statement. Let's break down how the program works and ensure it meets all the requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of watchmen.
   - It then reads `n` pairs of coordinates `(x, y)` for each watchman.

2. **Data Structures:**
   - `rows` dictionary keeps track of the number of occurrences of each x-coordinate.
   - `cols` dictionary keeps track of the number of occurrences of each y-coordinate.
   - `posi` dictionary keeps track of the number of occurrences of each coordinate pair `(x, y)`.

3. **Counting Pairs:**
   - The program iterates through the `rows` dictionary and calculates the number of pairs where the x-coordinates are the same. This is done using the formula \(\frac{(rows[t] - 1) * rows[t]}{2}\).
   - Similarly, it iterates through the `cols` dictionary and calculates the number of pairs where the y-coordinates are the same.
   - Finally, it iterates through the `posi` dictionary and subtracts the number of pairs where both coordinates are the same. This step ensures that pairs counted in the previous steps are not double-counted.

4. **Output:**
   - The final count of pairs is printed.

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Distance Calculation:**
  - The program correctly counts pairs of watchmen where the Manhattan distance equals the Euclidean distance. This happens when the difference in x-coordinates or y-coordinates is the same.

- **Handling Duplicates:**
  - The program correctly handles cases where multiple watchmen share the same x-coordinate or y-coordinate. It ensures that each pair is only counted once.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not rely on specific edge cases like invalid inputs or non-integer inputs, as these are assumed to be handled externally. It assumes valid input within the specified constraints.

Since the program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem and meets all the specified requirements, the correctness is True.
