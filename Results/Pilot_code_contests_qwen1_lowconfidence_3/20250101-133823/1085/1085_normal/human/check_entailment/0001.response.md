Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly count the number of pairs of watchmen such that the distance calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance calculated by Daniel. The issue lies in how the program calculates the number of pairs with the same Manhattan and Euclidean distances.

The program incorrectly adds the number of pairs based on individual coordinates and subtracts overlapping pairs. However, this approach does not account for the specific condition where the Manhattan distance equals the Euclidean distance. Specifically, the Manhattan distance \( |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j| \) equals the Euclidean distance \( \sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2} \) only when \( |x_i - x_j| = |y_i - y_j| \). 

To fix this, the program needs to specifically count pairs where the absolute differences in x-coordinates and y-coordinates are equal. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    pairs = {}
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = [int(t) for t in input().split(' ')]
        diff = abs(x - y)
        if diff in pairs:
            pairs[diff] += 1
        else:
            pairs[diff] = 1
    
    ans = 0
    for diff, count in pairs.items():
        if count > 1:
            # Number of ways to choose 2 out of count points
            ans += count * (count - 1) // 2
    
    print(ans)

func()
```

This version correctly counts the number of pairs by focusing on the difference between the x and y coordinates and using combinatorial counting to get the number of valid pairs.
