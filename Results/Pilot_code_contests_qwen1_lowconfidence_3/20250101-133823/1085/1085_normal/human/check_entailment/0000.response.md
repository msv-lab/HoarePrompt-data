Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the number of pairs of watchmen such that the distance calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance calculated by Daniel. The program uses dictionaries to count occurrences of each x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and (x, y) coordinate pair. It then applies the formulas to calculate the number of identical distance pairs:

1. For each unique x-coordinate, the number of pairs is calculated using the combination formula \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
2. Similarly, for each unique y-coordinate.
3. For each unique (x, y) coordinate pair, if there are multiple occurrences, it subtracts the overcounted pairs from the total.

This approach ensures that all potential cases where the distances match are counted accurately. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this program handles all possible scenarios without missing any pairs or including incorrect ones.
