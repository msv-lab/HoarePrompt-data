Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality. The problem description asks for the number of pairs of watchmen such that the distance calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance calculated by Daniel. The distance formula used by Daniel is the Euclidean distance, which is given by:

\[ \text{distance} = \sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2} \]

However, the code incorrectly calculates the number of pairs based on the frequency of \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates and the frequency of coordinate pairs. This approach does not take into account the actual Euclidean distance formula and thus does not correctly count the number of pairs where the distances match.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
0 0
1 1
0 1
1 0
```

The correct output should be 4 because the pairs (0,0) and (1,1), (0,0) and (0,1), (0,0) and (1,0), (1,1) and (0,1), (1,1) and (1,0), (0,1) and (1,0) have the same Euclidean distance as calculated by Doctor Manhattan and Daniel.

However, the given code would incorrectly count the pairs based on the frequency of coordinates, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
