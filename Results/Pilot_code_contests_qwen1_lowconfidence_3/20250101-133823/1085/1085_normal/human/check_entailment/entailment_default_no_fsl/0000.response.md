Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly count the number of pairs of watchmen such that the distance calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance calculated by Daniel. The logic in the code only counts the number of unique \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates and pairs that occur more than once, but it does not actually compare the Manhattan distance and Euclidean distance for each pair of watchmen.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
3
1 1
7 5
1 5
```

For this input, the correct output should be 2, because the pairs \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 5)\) have the same distance according to both Doctor Manhattan and Daniel, and the pair \((7, 5)\) and \((1, 5)\) also have the same distance.

However, the provided code would not correctly identify these pairs. Instead, it would only count the unique \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates and the pairs that occur more than once, which would lead to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
