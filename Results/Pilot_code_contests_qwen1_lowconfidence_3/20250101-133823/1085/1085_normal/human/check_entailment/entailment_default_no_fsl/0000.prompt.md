You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Watchmen are in a danger and Doctor Manhattan together with his friend Daniel Dreiberg should warn them as soon as possible. There are n watchmen on a plane, the i-th watchman is located at point (xi, yi).

They need to arrange a plan, but there are some difficulties on their way. As you know, Doctor Manhattan considers the distance between watchmen i and j to be |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|. Daniel, as an ordinary person, calculates the distance using the formula <image>.

The success of the operation relies on the number of pairs (i, j) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n), such that the distance between watchman i and watchmen j calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance between them calculated by Daniel. You were asked to compute the number of such pairs.

Input

The first line of the input contains the single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of watchmen.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 109).

Some positions may coincide.

Output

Print the number of pairs of watchmen such that the distance between them calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance calculated by Daniel.

Note

In the first sample, the distance between watchman 1 and watchman 2 is equal to |1 - 7| + |1 - 5| = 10 for Doctor Manhattan and <image> for Daniel. For pairs (1, 1), (1, 5) and (7, 5), (1, 5) Doctor Manhattan and Daniel will calculate the same distances.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    rows = {}
    cols = {}
    posi = {}
    for i in range(n):
        (x, y) = [int(t) for t in raw_input().split(' ')]
        if x in rows:
            rows[x] += 1
        else:
            rows[x] = 1
        if y in cols:
            cols[y] += 1
        else:
            cols[y] = 1
        if (x, y) in posi:
            posi[x, y] += 1
        else:
            posi[x, y] = 1
    ans = 0
    for t in rows.keys():
        ans = ans + (rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2
    for t in cols.keys():
        ans = ans + (cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2
    for t in posi.keys():
        if posi[t] > 1:
            ans -= (posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2
    print(ans)


```
Output hints: The function processes \(n\) pairs of integers \((x_i, y_i)\) where \(n\) is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\) and each pair satisfies \(|x_i|, |y_i| \leq 10^9\). It counts the occurrences of each \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) separately and together. Specifically, it calculates the number of unique \(x_i\) values, the number of unique \(y_i\) values, and the number of pairs \((x_i, y_i)\) that occur more than once. The function then computes a result based on these counts using the formula \((count - 1) * count / 2\) for both unique \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) values and subtracts the contribution of pairs that occur more than once. Finally, it prints the computed result. Potential edge cases include the minimum and maximum values of \(n\) and the range of \(x_i\) and \(y_i\), which are handled within the given constraints.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
