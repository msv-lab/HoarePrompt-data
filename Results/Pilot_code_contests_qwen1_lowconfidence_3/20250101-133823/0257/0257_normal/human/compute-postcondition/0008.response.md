The code initializes an empty list `out`. No values are assigned to any variables, and no operations are performed on existing variables. Therefore, the only change is the initialization of the list `out`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100 000; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and returns this list; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input and returns it; `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each element to an integer; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a list of `n` strings, each read from standard input using the `rstr()` function; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that generates a list of `n` integers, each read from standard input; `rints_2d` is a lambda function that generates a list of lists of integers, each list generated from a line read from standard input; `pr` is a lambda function that writes a string to the standard output using the provided arguments and separator; `out` is an empty list.**
