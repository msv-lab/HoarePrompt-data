Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the current program state step by step:

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while i * cur <= n:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Current program state right before the loop:
- `n` is >= 6
- `i` is `i_end + 1`
- `cur` is 2

To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to check the condition `i * cur <= n`.

1. **Evaluate the current values:**
   - `i = i_end + 1`
   - `cur = 2`
   - `n` is >= 6

2. **Substitute the known values into the condition:**
   - The condition becomes `(i_end + 1) * 2 <= n`

3. **Determine the necessary condition for the loop to execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `(i_end + 1) * 2` must be less than or equal to `n`.
   - Since `n` is already given as being >= 6, let's find the minimum value of `i_end` that satisfies this condition.

4. **Calculate the minimum `i_end`:**
   - Letâ€™s solve the inequality `(i_end + 1) * 2 <= n` for the smallest possible `n` (which is 6).
     \[
     (i_end + 1) * 2 \leq 6
     \]
     \[
     i_end + 1 \leq 3
     \]
     \[
     i_end \leq 2
     \]

Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `i_end` must be 2 or less.

Since the only state that needs adjustment is `i_end`, the modified state should ensure that `i_end` is 2 or less.

**State:**
State: **`n` is >= 6, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `cur` is 2 and `i_end` must be 2 or less**
