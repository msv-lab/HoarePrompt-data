The code defines a lambda function `rstr` which reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. However, this function does not assign any value to any existing variables or change the state of any variables. It simply creates a new function object `rstr`.

Since no variables are being modified or assigned new values, the only thing that changes is the definition of the `rstr` function. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.**
