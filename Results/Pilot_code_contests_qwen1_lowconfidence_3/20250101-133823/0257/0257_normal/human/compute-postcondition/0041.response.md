`cur` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` was `initial_cur + 2`, so the new value of `cur` is now `initial_cur + 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is `initial_ans + 8 * initial_cur + 4`; `cur` is `initial_cur + 3`; and `i * (initial_cur + 2) <= n` must still hold true.**
