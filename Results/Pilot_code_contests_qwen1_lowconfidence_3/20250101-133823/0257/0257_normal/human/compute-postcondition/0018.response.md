Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i * cur <= n`.
2. **Current States**: 
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.
   - `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus 4 times `cur`.
   - `cur` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine the Next State for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i * cur <= n` must be true.
   - Since `cur` is increased by 1 in each iteration, we need to ensure that `i * (cur + 1) <= n` holds true for the next iteration.

Given the current state:
- We know `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.
- We need to adjust `cur` such that the next value of `cur` (which is `cur + 1`) satisfies the loop condition with the current value of `i`.

Since the exact values of `i` and `cur` are not specified, we need to ensure that the loop can proceed based on the current state constraints. Specifically, `cur` must be such that when incremented by 1, the product `i * (cur + 1)` is still less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `cur` is increased by 1 in the next iteration, we need to ensure that the condition `i * (cur + 1) <= n` holds true.
   - Given that `n` must be greater than or equal to 6, and assuming the worst case where `i` is minimized (let's say `i = 1` for simplicity), we need `cur + 1` to be such that `1 * (cur + 1) <= n`.

Given that `cur` was previously incremented, let's denote the current value of `cur` as `c`. Therefore, in the next iteration, `cur` becomes `c + 1`. We need to ensure that:
\[ i \times (c + 2) \leq n \]

Since we don't have specific values for `i` and `n`, we'll assume the minimum necessary condition to satisfy the loop execution, which means `n` must allow for an additional increment of `cur`.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.
   - `cur` must be such that `i * (cur + 1) <= n` holds true.

Thus, the state for the next iteration should reflect the necessary conditions for the loop to continue executing.

**State:**
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 6 and `cur` must be such that `i * (cur + 1) <= n` holds true**.
