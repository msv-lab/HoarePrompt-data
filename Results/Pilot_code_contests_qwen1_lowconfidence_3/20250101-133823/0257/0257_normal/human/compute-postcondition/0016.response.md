`ans` is incremented by `4 * cur`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `cur`, it remains unchanged. The only variable affected is `ans`, which is now equal to its previous value plus `4 * cur`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 6; `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus 4 times `cur`**
