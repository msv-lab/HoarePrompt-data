The code defines a lambda function `rints_2d` which reads `n` lines from standard input, each line being split into a list of integers. This does not directly assign any values to existing variables but instead defines a new function. The variables `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, and `rint_2d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100 000; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and returns this list; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input and returns it; `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each element to an integer; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a list of `n` strings, each read from standard input using the `rstr()` function; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that generates a list of `n` integers, each read from standard input; `rints_2d` is a lambda function that generates a list of lists of integers, each list generated from a line read from standard input.**
