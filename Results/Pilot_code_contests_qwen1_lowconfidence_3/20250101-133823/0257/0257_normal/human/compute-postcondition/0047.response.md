The code `print(ans)` prints the value of the variable `ans`. Since the value of `ans` was calculated in the loop and does not change afterward, the only effect of this line is to output the value of `ans`. The values of `n`, `cur`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 6, `ans` is the sum of `4 * cur` for each iteration where `cur` started from 2 and incremented until the condition `i * cur > n` is met for the last executed iteration, `cur` is the final value of `cur` after the loop, `i` is the final value of `i` after the loop terminates, and `ans` is printed.**
