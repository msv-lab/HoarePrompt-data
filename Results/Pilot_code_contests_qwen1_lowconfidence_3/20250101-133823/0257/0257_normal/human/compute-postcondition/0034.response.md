According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 2 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, we know:

- `n` is greater than or equal to 6,
- `ans` is the sum of `4 * cur` for each iteration where `cur` started from 2 and incremented until the condition `i * cur > n` was met,
- `cur` is the final value of `cur` after the loop,
- `i` is the final value of `i` after the loop.

To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
2. **Values at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is at least 6.
   - `i` is the final value of `i` after the loop (let's denote it as `i_end`).
   - `cur` is the final value of `cur` after the loop (let's denote it as `cur_end`).

For the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `i` should be `i_end + 1`. Since `i` starts from 2 and increments by 1, the next value of `i` will be `i_end + 1`.

The new value of `cur` will be determined by the condition `i * cur > n`. Therefore, the new value of `cur` should be such that `(i_end + 1) * cur > n`.

However, without knowing the exact value of `i_end` and `cur_end`, we can only express the updated values in terms of these variables.

Given the above, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `n` remains the same (since `n` does not change within the loop),
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is `i_end + 1`,
- `cur` needs to be recalculated based on the new value of `i`, but we cannot determine its exact value without additional information.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is >= 6, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `cur` is the initial value to be determined such that `(i_end + 1) * cur > n`**
