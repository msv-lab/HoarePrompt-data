`ans` is initially `initial_ans + 4 * initial_cur`. The code updates `ans` by adding `4 * cur` to it. Since `cur` is `initial_cur + 1`, the new value of `ans` becomes `initial_ans + 4 * initial_cur + 4 * (initial_cur + 1)`, which simplifies to `initial_ans + 8 * initial_cur + 4`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `cur` is now `initial_cur + 2` because `cur` was initially `initial_cur + 1` and it increments by 1 in the code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is `initial_ans + 8 * initial_cur + 4`; `cur` is `initial_cur + 2`; and `i * (initial_cur + 2) <= n` must still hold true.

Output State: **`ans` is `initial_ans + 8 * initial_cur + 4`; `cur` is `initial_cur + 2`; and `i * (initial_cur + 2) <= n` must still hold true.**
