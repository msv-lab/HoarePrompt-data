The code defines a lambda function `rstr_2d` that creates a list of `n` strings, each read from standard input using the `rstr()` function. This does not immediately assign any values to variables but sets up the function `rstr_2d` which can be called later to create this list.

Since no actual input is provided or any calls to `rstr_2d` are made, the only thing impacted is the definition of the `rstr_2d` lambda function itself. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and returns this list; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input and returns it; `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each element to an integer; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a list of `n` strings, each read from standard input using the `rstr()` function.**
