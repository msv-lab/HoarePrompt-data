The code `ans += 4 * cur` updates the value of `ans` by adding `4 * cur` to its current value. Given the initial state, `cur` is 3, so `4 * cur` equals 12. Therefore, `ans` will be updated to its current value plus 12. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is >= 6, `ans` is `ans + 12`, `cur` is 3, and `i` must be <= 2**
