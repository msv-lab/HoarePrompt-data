The given code defines a lambda function `rint` that reads an integer from standard input using `int(stdin.readline())`. This lambda function does not assign the value read to any variable; instead, it returns the integer value read from standard input. The values of `n` and `rstr` remain unchanged because no assignment is performed on these variables within the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100 000; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and returns this list; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input and returns it.**
