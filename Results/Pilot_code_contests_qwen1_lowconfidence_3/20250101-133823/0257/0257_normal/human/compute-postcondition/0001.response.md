The given code does not actually execute any operations on the existing variables. Instead, it defines a new lambda function `rstrs`. This function reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and returns this list. The initial values of `n` and `rstr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and returns this list.**
