Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i * cur <= n`.

2. **Given States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.
   - `ans` is updated by `ans + 4 * cur`.
   - `cur` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Requirements**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i * cur` must be less than or equal to `n`.
   - We need to determine what values `i` and `cur` should have for the next iteration to satisfy the condition `i * cur <= n`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `cur` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, let's denote the current value of `cur` as `cur_current` and the new value of `cur` as `cur_next = cur_current + 1`.
   - The loop condition becomes `i * (cur_current + 1) <= n`.
   - To satisfy this condition in the next iteration, `i * cur_next` must be less than or equal to `n`.

5. **Ensuring the Condition is Met**:
   - We need to ensure that `i * (cur + 1) <= n` holds true for the next iteration.
   - Given that `cur` was incremented, the previous value of `cur` was `cur - 1`.
   - Therefore, we need to check the condition `i * cur <= n` with the updated value of `cur`.

6. **Final Adjustment**:
   - Since `cur` is incremented, we need to ensure that `i * (cur + 1)` does not exceed `n`.
   - This means that `n` must be sufficiently large to accommodate the next increment of `cur`.

Based on the above steps, we need to adjust the state such that the loop condition can be satisfied in the next iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 6, `ans` is updated by `ans + 4 * cur`, and `cur` is increased by 1. Additionally, `i * (cur + 1) <= n` must hold true for the next iteration.**
