The code snippet `ans += 4 * cur` increments the value of `ans` by `4 * cur`. The value of `cur` is increased by 1 in the previous line, so let's assume `cur` was `k` before this line. After the increment, `cur` becomes `k + 1`. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.
- `ans` is updated by `ans + 4 * cur`.
- `cur` is increased by 1.
- `i * (cur + 1) <= n` must hold true for the next iteration.

After executing `ans += 4 * cur`:
- `cur` becomes `cur + 1`.
- `ans` becomes `ans + 4 * cur`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.
- `ans` is now `ans + 4 * cur`.
- `cur` is now `cur + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is >= 6, `ans` is `ans + 4 * cur`, `cur` is `cur + 1`**
