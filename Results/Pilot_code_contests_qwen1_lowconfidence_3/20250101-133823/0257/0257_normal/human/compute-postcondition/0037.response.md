The code `ans += 4 * cur` increments `ans` by four times the value of `cur`. However, the initial values of `ans` and `cur` are not specified in the initial state. Let's denote the initial value of `ans` as `initial_ans` and the initial value of `cur` as `initial_cur`.

The impact of the code is:
- `ans` is updated to its current value plus four times the value of `cur`.

Since the initial values are not provided, we can represent the final values in terms of the initial values.

Output State: **`ans` is `initial_ans + 4 * initial_cur`, `cur` is `initial_cur`**
