Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.
   - `ans` is the sum of `4 * cur` for each iteration where `cur` started from 2 and incremented until the condition `i * cur > n` is met.
   - `cur` is the final value of `cur` after the loop terminates.

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` starting from 2 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - For each `i`, there is an inner loop that increments `cur` starting from 2 until `i * cur > n`.

3. **Determining the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the outer loop variable `i` needs to increment.
   - Since the outer loop starts at 2 and goes up to `n`, the next value of `i` would be `n + 1` if the current value of `i` is `n`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `n` remains the same as it is a condition for the loop but does not change within the loop.
   - `ans` is the sum of `4 * cur` for all valid iterations of `cur` and `i`.
   - `cur` is the final value after the inner loop terminates for the last `i` value. For the next iteration, `cur` will start from 2 again.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 6 (unchanged).
- `ans` remains the same as it is calculated based on all previous iterations.
- `cur` resets to 2 for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`n` must be greater than or equal to 6, `ans` is the sum of `4 * cur` for each iteration where `cur` started from 2 and incremented until the condition `i * cur > n` is met, `cur` is 2.**

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 6, `ans` is the sum of `4 * cur` for each iteration where `cur` started from 2 and incremented until the condition `i * cur > n` is met, `cur` is 2**
