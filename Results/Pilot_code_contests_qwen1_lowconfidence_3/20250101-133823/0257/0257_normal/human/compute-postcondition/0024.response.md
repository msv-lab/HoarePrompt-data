Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Current State Before Loop:**
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.
   - `ans` is the sum of `4 * cur` for each iteration where `cur` started from 2 and incremented until the condition `i * cur > n` is met.
   - `cur` is 2.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i * cur <= n`.

3. **Objective:**
   - We need to adjust the state so that the loop executes at least one more time.

4. **Analyze the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i * cur` must be less than or equal to `n`.
   - Given that `cur` is initially 2, the next value of `cur` will be 3.
   - Therefore, we need `i * 2 <= n` to be true for the loop to execute one more time.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 6 (since this was the initial requirement).
   - `i` must be such that `i * 2 <= n` holds true after the current iteration.

6. **Determine Initial Values:**
   - Since `cur` is currently 2, letâ€™s assume the loop has already executed once (i.e., `i * 2 <= n` is true for some `i`).
   - To ensure the loop executes again, `i` must be such that `i * 3 <= n` holds true.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the condition `i * 3 <= n` is satisfied. This means `n` must be large enough to accommodate the new condition, and `i` must be set appropriately.

### Conclusion:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.
- `i` must be such that `i * 2 <= n` is true (which is already given), and `i * 3 <= n` must also hold true for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 6, `i` must be such that `i * 3 <= n` holds true.**

However, since `n` is the only state that directly affects the loop condition, we can simplify this to just ensuring `n` is sufficiently large.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 6**
