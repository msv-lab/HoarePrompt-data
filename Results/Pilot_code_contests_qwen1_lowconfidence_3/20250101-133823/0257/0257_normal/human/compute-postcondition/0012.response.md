According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `cur`. The condition for the loop to continue is `i * cur <= n`. Right before the loop, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `cur` is 2.

For the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that the initial values of `i` and `cur` satisfy the condition `i * cur <= n`.

Given that `cur` is 2, the condition simplifies to `i * 2 <= n`. Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, let's consider the minimum possible value for `i` that satisfies this condition:

- If `n = 2`, then `i * 2 <= 2` implies `i <= 1`. The smallest integer value for `i` that satisfies this is `i = 1`.
- If `n > 2`, then `i` can start from 1 and still satisfy the condition as long as `i` is within reasonable bounds.

Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be 1 to ensure the loop executes at least once. 

The state right before the loop needs to be modified to reflect this:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `cur` is 2, and `i` must be 1**
