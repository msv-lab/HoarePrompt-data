The code defines a lambda function `pr` which writes a string to the standard output. It takes two arguments: `args`, which is an iterable, and `sep`, which is a separator string used to join the elements of `args`. The function joins the elements of `args` with `sep` and writes the resulting string followed by a newline character to the standard output.

This lambda function does not modify any existing variables but introduces a new function `pr`. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and returns this list; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input and returns it; `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each element to an integer; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a list of `n` strings, each read from standard input using the `rstr()` function; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that generates a list of `n` integers, each read from standard input; `rints_2d` is a lambda function that generates a list of lists of integers, each list generated from a line read from standard input; `pr` is a lambda function that writes a string to the standard output using the provided arguments and separator.**
