`cur` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `cur` is 2, so after the increment, `cur` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `cur` is 3, and `i` must be 1; `ans` is `ans` + 8.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `cur` is 3, and `i` must be 1; `ans` is `ans` + 8**
