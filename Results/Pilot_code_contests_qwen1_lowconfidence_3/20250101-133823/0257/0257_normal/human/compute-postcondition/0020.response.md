`cur` is incremented by 1, which means the new value of `cur` is its previous value plus 1. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as it does not depend on the increment of `cur`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is its previous value plus 4 times `cur`; `cur` is its previous value plus 1.

Output State: **`ans` is its previous value plus 4 times `cur`; `cur` is its previous value plus 1**
