Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i * cur <= n`.
2. **Given States at End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans` is `initial_ans + 8 * initial_cur + 4`
   - `cur` is `initial_cur + 3`
   - `i * (initial_cur + 2) <= n` must still hold true

3. **Loop Execution Requirement**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i * cur <= n` must be true.
   - Given `cur = initial_cur + 3`, we need to ensure that `i * (initial_cur + 3) <= n`.

4. **Check the Current State**:
   - We know `i * (initial_cur + 2) <= n` from the given state.
   - We need to check if `i * (initial_cur + 3) <= n` holds true.

5. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - From the given `i * (initial_cur + 2) <= n`, let's denote `initial_cur + 2` as `C2`.
   - Therefore, `i * C2 <= n`.
   - To ensure `i * (initial_cur + 3) <= n`, we need to check if `(initial_cur + 3)` is within the same range as `C2` plus 1.
   - Since `initial_cur + 3` is just 1 more than `initial_cur + 2`, and assuming `n` is large enough, `i * (initial_cur + 3) <= n` will likely hold true unless there is a specific constraint on `i` or `n`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs adjustment is ensuring that `i * (initial_cur + 3) <= n` holds true. Given the current state and the condition, this seems reasonable without additional constraints.

7. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - The state must be adjusted to ensure that the loop condition `i * (initial_cur + 3) <= n` holds true.

**State:**
**`ans` is `initial_ans + 8 * initial_cur + 4`, `cur` is `initial_cur + 3`, and `i * (initial_cur + 3) <= n` must still hold true.**
