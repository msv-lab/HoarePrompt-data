Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `cur` is 3.
   - `i` must be 1.
   - `ans` has an unknown value but is updated by adding 8 in each iteration.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `i * cur <= n`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i = 1`.
   - `cur = 3`.
   - `n >= 2`.

4. **Loop Execution:**
   - In the current state, `i * cur = 1 * 3 = 3`.
   - Since `3 <= n` (and `n >= 2`), the loop will execute one more time because `3 <= n` is true as long as `n >= 3`.

5. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i * cur` must still satisfy the condition `i * cur <= n`.
   - After this iteration, `i` will be incremented, so `i` will become `2`.
   - Therefore, the new condition will be `2 * 3 <= n` or `6 <= n`.

Given the above analysis, we need to adjust the state such that the condition `6 <= n` is met for the loop to execute one more time.

**Final State:**
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.

Thus, the state adjustment for the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 6**.
