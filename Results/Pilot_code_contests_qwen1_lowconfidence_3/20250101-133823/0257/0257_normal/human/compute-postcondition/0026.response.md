`cur` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `cur` is increased by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged since no operation affecting `n` is performed, and the value of `ans` is also unchanged because the code snippet only modifies `cur`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 6; `ans` is updated by `ans + 4 * cur`; `cur` is increased by 1**
