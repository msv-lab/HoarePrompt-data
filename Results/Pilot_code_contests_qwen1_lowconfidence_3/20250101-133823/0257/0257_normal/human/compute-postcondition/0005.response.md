The code defines a lambda function `rint_2d` that generates a list of `n` integers, each read from standard input. The variable `n` remains unchanged and is still an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000. The lambda functions `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, and `rstr_2d` are not affected by the definition of `rint_2d`.

Since `rint_2d` does not execute any input operations itself, it does not change the values of the existing variables like `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, and `rstr_2d`. It only defines what `rint_2d` will do when called.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and returns this list; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input and returns it; `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each element to an integer; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a list of `n` strings, each read from standard input using the `rstr()` function; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that generates a list of `n` integers, each read from standard input.**
