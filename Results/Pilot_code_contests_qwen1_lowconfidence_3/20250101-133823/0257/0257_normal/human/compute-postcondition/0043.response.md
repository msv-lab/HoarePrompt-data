The code `ans += 4 * cur` updates the value of `ans` by adding `4 * cur` to its current value. However, since the initial values of `ans` and `cur` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact updated value of `ans`. We can only state that `ans` has been updated.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `4 * cur` to its current value, `cur` retains its original value**
