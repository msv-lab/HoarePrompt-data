The code `ans += 4 * cur` updates the value of `ans` by adding `4 * cur` to its current value. However, since the initial values of `ans` and `cur` are not specified, we can only express the updated value of `ans` in terms of its previous value and `cur`.

Output State: **`ans` is its previous value plus 4 times `cur`, `cur` retains its original value**
