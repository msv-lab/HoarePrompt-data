According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `cur`. If the condition `i * cur <= n` is true, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is `initial_ans + 4 * initial_cur`, and `cur` is `initial_cur + 1`.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the condition `i * cur <= n`:

- The current value of `cur` is `initial_cur + 1`.
- Therefore, the next value of `cur` would be `initial_cur + 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i * (initial_cur + 2) <= n` must be true.

Given that `i` remains unchanged from the previous iteration, and assuming `i` is the same as in the previous iteration, we need to adjust the state such that `i * (initial_cur + 2) <= n` holds true.

So, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `i * (initial_cur + 2) <= n` must be true.

State: **`ans` is `initial_ans + 4 * initial_cur`, `cur` is `initial_cur + 1`, and `i * (initial_cur + 2) <= n` must hold true.**
