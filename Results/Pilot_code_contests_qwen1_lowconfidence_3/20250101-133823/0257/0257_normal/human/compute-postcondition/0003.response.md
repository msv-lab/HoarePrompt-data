The given code defines a lambda function `rints` which reads multiple integers from a single line of input, splits the line into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. This lambda function does not assign the result to any variable; instead, it simply defines the function. Therefore, no variables are updated or changed by this code. The only thing that happens is the definition of the `rints` lambda function.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and returns this list; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input and returns it; `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each element to an integer.**
