The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, and the initial conditions that `n` must be greater than or equal to 6 and `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus 4 times `cur` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 6; `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus 4 times `cur`; `cur` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 6; `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus 4 times `cur`; `cur` is increased by 1**
