The code reads an integer `n` from standard input and assigns it to `n`. It also initializes `ans` to 0. The other lambda functions (`rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, `rints_2d`, `pr`, `out`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer read from standard input, `ans` is 0, `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace, `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and returns this list, `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input and returns it, `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each element to an integer, `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a list of `n` strings, each read from standard input using the `rstr()` function, `rint_2d` is a lambda function that generates a list of `n` integers, each read from standard input, `rints_2d` is a lambda function that generates a list of lists of integers, each list generated from a line read from standard input, `pr` is a lambda function that writes a string to the standard output using the provided arguments and separator, `out` is an empty list.**
