`cur` is incremented by 1. The value of `ans` remains unchanged and is still equal to `initial_ans + 4 * initial_cur`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is `initial_ans + 4 * initial_cur`; `cur` is `initial_cur + 1`.

Output State: **`ans` is `initial_ans + 4 * initial_cur`; `cur` is `initial_cur + 1`**
