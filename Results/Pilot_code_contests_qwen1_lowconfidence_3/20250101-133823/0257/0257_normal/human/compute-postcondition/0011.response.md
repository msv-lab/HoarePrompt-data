The code initializes `cur` with the value 2. The initial state of `n` is such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. The value of `n` itself is not changed by this code, only a new variable `cur` is introduced and assigned the value 2. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `cur` is 2**
