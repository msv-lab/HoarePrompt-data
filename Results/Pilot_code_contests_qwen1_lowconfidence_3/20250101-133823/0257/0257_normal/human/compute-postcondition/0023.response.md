The code `cur = 2` simply assigns the value `2` to the variable `cur`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `ans`. The initial state is that `n` must be greater than or equal to 6, `ans` is the sum of `4 * cur` for each iteration where `cur` started from 2 and incremented until the condition `i * cur > n` is met, and `cur` is 2.

Since the code only updates `cur` to `2`, which is already its initial value, no new calculation for `ans` is performed. Therefore, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 6, `ans` is the sum of `4 * cur` for each iteration where `cur` started from 2 and incremented until the condition `i * cur > n` is met, `cur` is 2**
