The code snippet `ans += 4 * cur` updates the value of `ans` by adding `4 * cur` to its current value. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `cur`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `ans` has been updated by `4 * cur`, while the condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 6 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 6; `ans` is updated by `ans + 4 * cur`**
