Functionality: **The function calculates the sum of values `4 * cur` for each iteration where `cur` starts from 2 and increments until the condition `i * cur > n` is met for the last executed iteration. Specifically, it iterates over all integers `i` from 2 to `n`, and for each `i`, it adds `4 * cur` to the variable `ans` while `i * cur` is less than or equal to `n`. The function takes no explicit parameters but reads `n` from standard input, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000`. After the function concludes, the final state of the program is that `ans` contains the computed sum, and `n` retains its original value read from input. No output is explicitly returned; instead, the result `ans` is printed to standard output. Potential edge cases include the minimum value of `n` (2), where only one iteration occurs, and the maximum value of `n` (100,000), which may involve a large number of iterations. The function does not handle invalid inputs for `n` other than checking the bounds, and it assumes valid integer input within the specified range.**
