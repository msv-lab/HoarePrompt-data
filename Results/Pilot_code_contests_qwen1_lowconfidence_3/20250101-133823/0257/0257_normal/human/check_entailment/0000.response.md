Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the transformation rules described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the maximum score based on a flawed assumption about the transformations.

The problem statement describes that for a given integer \( n \), you can transform \( a \) into \( b \) if there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( 1 < |x| \) and either \( a \cdot x = b \) or \( b \cdot x = a \). The program attempts to calculate the score by iterating over each number from 2 to \( n \) and counting multiples up to \( n \), but this approach does not capture all valid transformations as per the problem's constraints.

For example, consider \( n = 6 \):

- Starting with 2, we can transform 2 to 4 (with \( x = 2 \)), 4 to -2 (with \( x = -2 \)), and so on.
- The correct sequence of transformations would be: \( 2 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow -2 \rightarrow -4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow -2 \rightarrow -4 \).
- This results in a total score of 8, which is correct as shown in the example output.

However, the program calculates the score as follows:
- For each \( i \) from 2 to \( n \), it adds \( 4 \times \text{cur} \) to the score, where \( \text{cur} \) starts from 2 and increments.
- This calculation does not account for all valid transformations as per the problem's constraints, leading to an incorrect score.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to properly account for all valid transformations between pairs of numbers within the range.
