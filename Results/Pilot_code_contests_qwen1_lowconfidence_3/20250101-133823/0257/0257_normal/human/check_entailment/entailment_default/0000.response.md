Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The problem description requires finding the maximum score achievable by transforming integers `a` and `b` using the specified rules. The code, however, appears to be calculating a sum based on the given formula without actually simulating the transformations.

For every pair of integers \(a\) and \(b\) where \(2 \leq |a|, |b| \leq n\), the score increases by \(|x|\) points if there exists an integer \(x\) such that \(a \cdot x = b\) or \(b \cdot x = a\). The code, however, simply calculates a sum of \(4 \cdot cur\) for each \(i\) from 2 to \(n\), which does not accurately represent the transformations described.

To properly solve this problem, you would need to simulate the transformations and keep track of the score. The current implementation does not simulate these transformations and therefore does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
