Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `n` is even. Specifically, for even `n`, the transformations can involve pairs like `(2, 4, -2, -4)` which lead to a score increase of `8`. However, the program logic does not correctly account for these transformations.

For example, consider the input `n = 4`. According to the problem description, the maximum score should be `8` from the sequence `2 → 4 → (-2) → (-4) → 2`. However, the program incorrectly calculates the score as `0`.

The issue lies in the loop `for i in range(2, n + 1):` where the program does not fully capture the transformations for even `n`. A more comprehensive approach is needed to handle both even and odd `n` cases correctly.
