Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. According to the problem, the score is incremented by \(|x|\) points for each transformation where \(a \cdot x = b\) or \(b \cdot x = a\). However, the code calculates the sum as \(4 \times \text{cur}\) for each iteration without properly accounting for the value of \(|x|\).

For example, consider the case where \(n = 4\):

- The code will iterate over \(i = 2, 3, 4\).
- For \(i = 2\), it will calculate \(4 \times 2 = 8\).
- For \(i = 3\), it will calculate \(4 \times 2 = 8\).
- For \(i = 4\), it will calculate \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

This results in a total of \(8 + 8 + 8 = 24\), which is incorrect. The correct score for \(n = 4\) should be 8, as the transformations \(2 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow -2 \rightarrow -4 \rightarrow 2\) yield a score of 8.

Similarly, for \(n = 6\), the correct score should be 28, but the code would incorrectly compute a higher score due to the incorrect formula used.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required transformations and scoring mechanism, leading to incorrect outputs for several cases.
