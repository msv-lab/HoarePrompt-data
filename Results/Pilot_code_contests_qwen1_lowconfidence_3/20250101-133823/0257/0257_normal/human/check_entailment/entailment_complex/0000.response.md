Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Let's break down why:

### Problem Description Analysis:
- For every pair of integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(2 \leq |a|, |b| \leq n\), you can transform \(a\) into \(b\) if there exists an integer \(x\) (where \(1 < |x|\)) such that \(a \cdot x = b\) or \(b \cdot x = a\).
- The score increases by \(|x|\) points for each transformation.
- Initially, the score is 0.
- The goal is to maximize the score by performing valid transformations.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads an integer \(n\) from standard input and then calculates the maximum score using a specific formula.
- The formula used in the program is:
  \[
  \text{ans} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} 4 \times \text{cur}
  \]
  where \(\text{cur}\) starts from 2 and increments until \(i \times \text{cur} > n\).

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Transformation Logic**: 
   - The program does not actually simulate the transformation process described in the problem. It simply computes a sum based on a fixed formula without considering the actual transformations between pairs of integers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The formula \(4 \times \text{cur}\) is not derived from the transformation rules given in the problem. It appears to be a heuristic or a simplified approach, but it does not reflect the actual logic required to solve the problem.

2. **Missing Transformation Implementation**:
   - The program does not implement the logic to find valid transformations between pairs of integers. It only calculates a sum based on a fixed increment value, which does not account for the constraints and conditions of the problem.

3. **Example Verification**:
   - For \(n = 4\), the expected output is 8, but the program's output is also 8, which might appear correct at first glance. However, this is coincidental because the fixed formula happens to produce the correct result for this particular value of \(n\). For other values of \(n\), the program would likely produce incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly implement the solution, the program should:
- Identify all valid pairs of integers \(a\) and \(b\) within the given range.
- For each pair, check if there exists an integer \(x\) such that \(a \cdot x = b\) or \(b \cdot x = a\).
- Track the transformations and calculate the score accordingly.

Given the above analysis, the program does not follow the problem description accurately and therefore is incorrect.
