You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today, as a friendship gift, Bakry gave Badawy n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and challenged him to choose an integer X such that the value \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X) is minimum possible, where ⊕ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

As always, Badawy is too lazy, so you decided to help him and find the minimum possible value of \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X).

Input

The first line contains integer n (1≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 2^{30}-1).

Output

Print one integer — the minimum possible value of \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails when all elements in the array are the same. Let's consider an example:

Input:
```
3
1 1 1
```

According to the problem description, the goal is to find an integer \(X\) such that the maximum value of \(a_i \oplus X\) is minimized. In this case, the optimal \(X\) would be 0 because \(1 \oplus 0 = 1\), and the maximum value is 1, which is the smallest possible maximum value for the given inputs.

However, the program will not correctly handle this scenario. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. When all elements are the same, the program will initialize `ans` with a binary string that does not change properly during the loop, leading to incorrect calculations for `ansl` and `ansr`.
2. The loop that constructs `ans` will not modify `ans` since there is no bit position where the counts of '0' and '1' differ across all elements. As a result, `ans` will remain an empty string or incorrectly constructed string, leading to incorrect values for `ansl` and `ansr`.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case where all elements are the same more explicitly. One way to do this is to check if all elements are the same before entering the main loop and set `X` to 0 in that case. Here is a modified version of the function to handle this edge case:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Check if all elements are the same
    if len(set(a)) == 1:
        print(0)
        return
    
    s = []
    for i in a:
        ts = bin(i)[2:]
        ts = ts[::-1]
        while len(ts) < 32:
            ts += '0'
        s.append(ts)
    
    ans = ''
    brk = -1
    leftp = 0
    ansl = -1
    ansr = -1
    for j in range(31, -1, -1):
        c1 = 0
        c0 = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i][j] == '0':
                c0 += 1
            else:
                c1 += 1
        if c1 == n:
            ans += '1'
        elif c0 == n:
            ans += '0'
        else:
            mx0 = 0
            mx1 = 0
            ans += '1'
            leftp = int(ans, 2)
            leftp <<= j
            for i in range(n):
                if s[i][j] == '0':
                    mx0 = max(mx0, int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2))
                else:
                    mx1 = max(mx1, int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2))
            ansl = leftp + mx0
            ansr = leftp + mx1
            break
    
    if ansl == -1:
        leftp = int(ans, 2)
        a1 = 0
        for i in a:
            a1 = max(a1, leftp ^ i)
        print(a1)
    else:
        m1 = 0
        m0 = 0
        for i in a:
            m1 = max(m1, ansr ^ i)
            m0 = max(m0, ansl ^ i)
        print(min(m1, m0))
```

With this modification, the program will correctly handle the case where all elements are the same, ensuring it meets the problem description for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func()` takes an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` as input. It processes the binary representations of the integers in `a` to determine certain values based on their bit patterns. Specifically, it constructs a binary string `ans` by examining the bits of the integers in `a`. If all bits in a position are the same (either all 0s or all 1s), `ans` is set accordingly. Otherwise, it calculates two values `ansl` and `ansr` representing the maximum possible values by flipping one bit at a time, and then prints the minimum of the results of two operations: either the maximum bitwise XOR of `leftp` (which is \(2^{31}\)) with each element in `a`, or the minimum of the maximum bitwise XOR of `ansr` and `ansl` with each element in `a`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
