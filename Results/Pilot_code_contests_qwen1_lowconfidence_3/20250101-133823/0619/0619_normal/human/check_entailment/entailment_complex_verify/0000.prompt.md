You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today, as a friendship gift, Bakry gave Badawy n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and challenged him to choose an integer X such that the value \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X) is minimum possible, where ⊕ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

As always, Badawy is too lazy, so you decided to help him and find the minimum possible value of \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X).

Input

The first line contains integer n (1≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 2^{30}-1).

Output

Print one integer — the minimum possible value of \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a bit manipulation approach, but it has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of XOR and Bit Manipulation**: The program tries to find the minimum possible value of \(\max(a_i \oplus X)\) by constructing a binary string `ans` and manipulating it bit by bit. However, this approach does not guarantee finding the optimal \(X\) because it does not consider all possible values of \(X\) exhaustively. Specifically, the program breaks out of the loop prematurely and does not ensure that the chosen \(X\) minimizes the maximum XOR value for all elements in the array.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum XOR Values**: The program calculates `mx0` and `mx1` incorrectly. It should consider the effect of each bit on the overall XOR value, but the current implementation only considers the prefix up to the current bit position without properly accounting for the remaining bits.

3. **Incomplete Logic for Final XOR Calculations**: After breaking out of the loop, the program calculates `ansl` and `ansr`, but it does not properly handle the final XOR calculations for all elements in the array to determine the minimum possible value of \(\max(a_i \oplus X)\). The variables `m1` and `m0` are calculated, but they do not reflect the correct minimum value because the logic for determining the optimal \(X\) is flawed.

A correct solution would involve a more systematic approach to bit manipulation and ensuring that all possible values of \(X\) are considered to find the minimum possible value of \(\max(a_i \oplus X)\). The provided code does not achieve this and thus fails to meet the problem description for certain inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Otherwise, `m0` and `m1` are both 0, and the printed value is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func()` takes an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` as input. It processes the binary representations of the integers in `a` to determine certain values based on their bit patterns. Specifically, it constructs a binary string `ans` by examining the bits of the integers in `a`. If all bits in a position are the same (either all 0s or all 1s), `ans` is set accordingly. Otherwise, it calculates two values `ansl` and `ansr` representing the maximum possible values by flipping one bit at a time, and then prints the minimum of the results of two operations: either the maximum bitwise XOR of `leftp` (which is \(2^{31}\)) with each element in `a`, or the minimum of the maximum bitwise XOR of `ansr` and `ansl` with each element in `a`.
