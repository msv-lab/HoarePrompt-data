You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today, as a friendship gift, Bakry gave Badawy n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and challenged him to choose an integer X such that the value \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X) is minimum possible, where ⊕ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

As always, Badawy is too lazy, so you decided to help him and find the minimum possible value of \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X).

Input

The first line contains integer n (1≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 2^{30}-1).

Output

Print one integer — the minimum possible value of \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X).

Examples

Note

In the first sample, we can choose X = 3.

In the second sample, we can choose X = 5.
Program:

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    s = []
    for i in a:
        ts = bin(i)[2:]
        ts = ts[::-1]
        while len(ts) < 32:
            ts += '0'
        s.append(ts)

        for i in range(n):
            if s[i][j] == '0':
                c0 += 1
            else:
                c1 += 1
        if c1 == n:
            ans += '1'
        elif c0 == n:
            ans += '0'
        else:
            mx0 = 0
            mx1 = 0
            ans += '1'
            leftp = int(ans, 2)
            leftp <<= j
            for i in range(n):
                if s[i][j] == '0':
                    mx0 = max(mx0, int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2))
                else:
                    mx1 = max(mx1, int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2))
            ansl = leftp + mx0
            ansr = leftp + mx1
            break
    if ansl == -1:
        leftp = int(ans, 2)
        a1 = 0
        for i in a:
            a1 = max(a1, leftp ^ i)
        print(a1)
    else:
        m1 = 0
        m0 = 0
        for i in a:
            m1 = max(m1, ansr ^ i)
            m0 = max(m0, ansl ^ i)
        print(min(m1, m0))


```
Output hints: The function `func()` takes an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` as input. It processes the binary representations of the integers in `a` to determine certain values based on their bit patterns. Specifically, it constructs a binary string `ans` by examining the bits of the integers in `a`. If all bits in a position are the same (either all 0s or all 1s), `ans` is set accordingly. Otherwise, it calculates two values `ansl` and `ansr` representing the maximum possible values by flipping one bit at a time, and then prints the minimum of the results of two operations: either the maximum bitwise XOR of `leftp` (which is \(2^{31}\)) with each element in `a`, or the minimum of the maximum bitwise XOR of `ansr` and `ansl` with each element in `a`.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
