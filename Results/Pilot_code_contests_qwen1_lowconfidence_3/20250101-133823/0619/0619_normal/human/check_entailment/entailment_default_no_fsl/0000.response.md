Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code fails to handle the case where the optimal solution is achieved by flipping more than just one bit. 

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 2 3 7
```

The correct answer should be `2` because we can choose \( X = 3 \). However, the current implementation might not correctly handle this scenario. The code focuses on flipping bits one at a time and might not explore all possible optimal solutions by flipping multiple bits simultaneously.

To illustrate, let's manually check the bitwise XOR values for \( X = 3 \):
- \( 1 \oplus 3 = 2 \)
- \( 2 \oplus 3 = 1 \)
- \( 3 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
- \( 7 \oplus 3 = 4 \)

The maximum value here is `4`, which is not the minimum possible value. The correct minimum possible value is `2`, which can be achieved by choosing \( X = 3 \).

The current implementation does not cover scenarios where the optimal solution requires flipping multiple bits simultaneously, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
