You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today, as a friendship gift, Bakry gave Badawy n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and challenged him to choose an integer X such that the value \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X) is minimum possible, where ⊕ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

As always, Badawy is too lazy, so you decided to help him and find the minimum possible value of \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X).

Input

The first line contains integer n (1≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 2^{30}-1).

Output

Print one integer — the minimum possible value of \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails when all elements in the array are the same. Let's consider an example:

Input:
```
3
1 1 1
```

According to the problem description, the goal is to find an integer \(X\) such that the maximum value of \(a_i \oplus X\) is minimized. In this case, the optimal \(X\) would be 0 because \(1 \oplus 0 = 1\), and the maximum value is 1, which is the smallest possible maximum value for the given inputs.

However, the program will not correctly handle this scenario. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. When all elements are the same, the program will initialize `ans` with a binary string that does not change properly during the loop, leading to incorrect calculations for `ansl` and `ansr`.
2. The loop that constructs `ans` will not modify `ans` since there is no bit position where the counts of '0' and '1' differ across all elements. As a result, `ans` will remain an empty string or incorrectly constructed string, leading to incorrect values for `ansl` and `ansr`.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case where all elements are the same more explicitly. One way to do this is to check if all elements are the same before entering the main loop and set `X` to 0 in that case. Here is a modified version of the function to handle this edge case:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Check if all elements are the same
    if len(set(a)) == 1:
        print(0)
        return
    
    s = []
    for i in a:
        ts = bin(i)[2:]
        ts = ts[::-1]
        while len(ts) < 32:
            ts += '0'
        s.append(ts)
    
    ans = ''
    brk = -1
    leftp = 0
    ansl = -1
    ansr = -1
    for j in range(31, -1, -1):
        c1 = 0
        c0 = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i][j] == '0':
                c0 += 1
            else:
                c1 += 1
        if c1 == n:
            ans += '1'
        elif c0 == n:
            ans += '0'
        else:
            mx0 = 0
            mx1 = 0
            ans += '1'
            leftp = int(ans, 2)
            leftp <<= j
            for i in range(n):
                if s[i][j] == '0':
                    mx0 = max(mx0, int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2))
                else:
                    mx1 = max(mx1, int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2))
            ansl = leftp + mx0
            ansr = leftp + mx1
            break
    
    if ansl == -1:
        leftp = int(ans, 2)
        a1 = 0
        for i in a:
            a1 = max(a1, leftp ^ i)
        print(a1)
    else:
        m1 = 0
        m0 = 0
        for i in a:
            m1 = max(m1, ansr ^ i)
            m0 = max(m0, ansl ^ i)
        print(min(m1, m0))
```

With this modification, the program will correctly handle the case where all elements are the same, ensuring it meets the problem description for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
