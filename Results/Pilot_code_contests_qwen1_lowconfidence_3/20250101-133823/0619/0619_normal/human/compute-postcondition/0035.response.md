`s.append(ts)` appends the value of `ts` to the list `s`. Since `ts` is a string of 32 '0' characters, it gets added to the list. The values of `ts` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`ts` is a string of 32 '0' characters, the length of `ts` is 32, `i` is the next element in the list `a` and has fewer than 32 bits in its binary representation after reversal; `s` is a list containing one element which is the string '00000000000000000000000000000000'**
