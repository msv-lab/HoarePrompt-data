Postcondition: **`i` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 0, `c0` is the count of '0's at the least significant bit position, `c1` is the count of '1's at the least significant bit position, `ans` is constructed based on the conditions involving `c0` and `c1`, `ansl` is \(2^{31} + mx1\), `ansr` is \(2^{31} + mx1\), `leftp` is \(2^{31}\). If `ansl` equals -1, then `a1` is the maximum value obtained by taking the bitwise XOR of `leftp` with each element in the list `a`, and `a1` is printed. Otherwise, `m0` and `m1` are both 0, and the printed value is 0.**
