According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.

Given the loop continues as long as `i < n`, and since `n` is a positive integer, `i` will be incremented from 0 to 1, and the loop can continue if `n` remains the same or if it does not change to a value less than or equal to 0.

Let's summarize the states that need to be adjusted:

- `i` will be incremented from 0 to 1.
- `n` must remain a positive integer to allow the loop to continue.
- The other variables (`s`, `j`, `c0`, `c1`, `mx0`, `mx1`, `ans`, `leftp`) do not depend directly on the loop condition and thus remain unchanged for this iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is an index within the current string in `s`, `c0` is incremented by one if the current character is '0', `c1` is incremented by the number of '1's encountered in the string up to index `j` (but `c0` is not equal to `n`), `mx0` is 5 if the current character is '0', `mx1` is the decimal value of the binary string `sub_str[::-1]` if the current character is '1', `ans` is 1, `leftp` is \(2^j\)**.
