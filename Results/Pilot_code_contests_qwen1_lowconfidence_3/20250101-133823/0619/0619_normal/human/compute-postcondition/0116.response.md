The line `mx1 = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `mx1`. This is the only change made by the code. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 30, `c0` is the count of '0' at index `j` across all strings in `s`, `c1` is the count of '1' at index `j` across all strings in `s`, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0, and `c0` is not equal to `n`.**
