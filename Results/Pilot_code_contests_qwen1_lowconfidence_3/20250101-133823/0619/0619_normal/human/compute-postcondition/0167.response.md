The code `leftp = int(ans, 2)` converts the binary string stored in `ans` to an integer and assigns it to `leftp`. Given that `ans` initially includes the character '1' appended to its previous value, let's assume `ans` is initially "1" (since no previous value is given, and appending '1' to an empty string would be "1"). The integer value of the binary string "1" is 1.

Therefore, `leftp` is assigned the value 1, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 29, `ans` includes the character '1' appended to its previous value, `leftp` is 1, `ansl` and `ansr` are calculated and possibly updated based on certain conditions, `c1` is less than `n`, the character at index `i` and position `j` in `s` is not '0', `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0**
