Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is an index within the current string in `s`. `c0` is incremented by the number of '0's encountered in the string up to index `j` unless `c1` is not equal to `n`, `c1` is incremented by the number of '1's encountered in the string up to index `j`. The current value of `c0` is equal to `n`.***
