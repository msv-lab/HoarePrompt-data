`ans` is assigned the value of itself plus a '1'. This means that the string `ans` gets appended with a '1'. The variables `i`, `n`, `s`, `j`, `c1`, and `c0` are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is an index within the current string in `s`, `c1` equals `n`, `c0` is incremented by the number of '0's encountered in the string up to index `j`, `ans` is a string with one additional '1' at the end.**
