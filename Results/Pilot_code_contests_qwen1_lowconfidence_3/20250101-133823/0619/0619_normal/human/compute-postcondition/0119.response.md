The code `leftp <<= j` shifts the bits of `leftp` to the left by `j` positions. Given that `j` is 30, this operation multiplies `leftp` by \(2^{30}\). 

- Initially, `leftp` is `int(original_ans + '1', 2)`, which means `leftp` is the integer representation of the binary number formed by appending '1' to the binary representation of `original_ans`.
- Shifting `leftp` to the left by 30 positions effectively multiplies `leftp` by \(2^{30}\).

Since the exact value of `original_ans` is not provided, let's denote it as `original_ans`. Therefore, the initial value of `leftp` is `int(original_ans + '1', 2)`.

After shifting, `leftp` becomes `int(original_ans + '1', 2) * 2^30`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 30, `c0` is the count of '0' at index `j` across all strings in `s`, `c1` is the count of '1' at index `j` across all strings in `s`, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0, and `leftp` is `int(original_ans + '1', 2) * 2^30**.
