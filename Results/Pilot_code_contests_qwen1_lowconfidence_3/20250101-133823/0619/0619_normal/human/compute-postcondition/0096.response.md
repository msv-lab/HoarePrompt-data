`c0` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 30, `c1` is 0, and the current value of `s[i][j]` is '0'. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 30, `c1` is 0, `c0` is 1, and the current value of `s[i][j]` is '0'**
