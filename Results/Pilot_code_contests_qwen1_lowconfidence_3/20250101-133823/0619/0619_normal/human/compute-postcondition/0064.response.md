`ans` is assigned the value `'0'` and added to the existing value of `ans`. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, so we only know that it now includes `'0'`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is an index within the current string in `s`, `c0` is equal to `n`, `c1` is incremented by the number of '1's encountered in the string up to index `j`, and `ans` now includes `'0'`.**
