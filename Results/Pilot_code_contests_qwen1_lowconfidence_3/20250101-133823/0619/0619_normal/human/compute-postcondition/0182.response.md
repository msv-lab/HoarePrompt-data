Postcondition: ***`mx0` and `mx1` are updated according to the following rules: if `s[i][j] == '0'`, then `mx0` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the integer value of the reversed substring from `s[i][:j]` (interpreted in binary). Otherwise, `mx1` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the integer value of the reversed substring from `s[i][:j]` (interpreted in binary).***
