The code `ts = ts[::-1]` reverses the string `ts`. The original value of `ts` is the binary representation of `i` without the '0b' prefix. Reversing this string changes its order but does not affect the value of `i`, `n`, `a`, `s`, or any other variables.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `a` is a list of integers containing `n` elements, `s` is a list containing one element, which is a list of 32 '0' characters, `ts` is the reversed binary representation of `i` without the '0b' prefix, `i` is the first element of `a`**
