Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over the list `a`.
   - The variable `i` takes each element from the list `a` one by one.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer input between 1 and \(10^5\) (inclusive).
   - `a` is a list of integers containing `n` elements.
   - `s` is an empty list.

3. **Analyze the Loop Execution Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element. Since `a` contains `n` elements, and `n` is at least 1, `a` will always have at least one element if `n` is positive.

4. **State the Required Adjustments:**
   - The initial value of `n` and the fact that `a` contains `n` elements should be stated explicitly to ensure the loop can execute.
   - The state of `s` (which is empty) does not affect the loop's ability to execute but can be mentioned for completeness.

Given these points, the required state adjustments for the loop to execute are:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `a` is a list of integers containing `n` elements, `s` is an empty list**
