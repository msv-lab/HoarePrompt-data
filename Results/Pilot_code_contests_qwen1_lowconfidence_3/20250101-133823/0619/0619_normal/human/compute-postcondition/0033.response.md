The code appends the string '0' to `ts`. Initially, `ts` is '00'. After appending '0', `ts` becomes '000'. The length of `ts` remains less than 32, which is still true. Therefore, the output state is: `ts` is '000' and the length of `ts` must be less than 32.

Output State: **`ts` is '000', the length of `ts` must be less than 32**
