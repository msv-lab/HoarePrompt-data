Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `a` is a list of integers containing `n` elements, `s` is a list containing one element, which is a list of 32 '0' characters, `ts` is the reversed binary representation of the initial value of `i` (without the '0b' prefix) and padded with zeros to a length of 32, and `i` is an integer whose binary representation (after reversal) has fewer than 32 bits.**
