Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 30, `c0` is the count of '0' at index `j` across all strings in `s`, `c1` is the count of '1' at index `j` across all strings in `s`, `c0` equals `n` and `c1` is not equal to `n`, `ans` is '0', or `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 30, `c0` is the count of '0' at index `j` across all strings in `s`, `c1` is the count of '1' at index `j` across all strings in `s`, `mx0` is the maximum value among the binary values of the reversed substrings `s[i][:j][::-1]` for each `s[i][j] == '0'`, `mx1` is the maximum value among the decimal equivalents of the reversed substrings `s[i][:j][::-1]` for each `s[i][j] == '1'`, `ansl` is `leftp + mx0`, `ansr` is `leftp + mx1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
