`m1` is assigned the value of the maximum between `m1` and `ansr ^ i`. The previous value of `m1` is the same as its previous value, and the value of `m0` is the maximum of its current value and `ansr` ^ the next value of `i`. Therefore, `m1` will take the maximum value between its previous value and `ansr ^ i`. The states of the other variables (`m0` and `a`) are not affected.

Output State: **`m0` is the maximum of its current value and `ansr` ^ the next value of `i`, `m1` is the maximum of its previous value and `ansr` ^ `i`, `a` is a non-empty iterable**
