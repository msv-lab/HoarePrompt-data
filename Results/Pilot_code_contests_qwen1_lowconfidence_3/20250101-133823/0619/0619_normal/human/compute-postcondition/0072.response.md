Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is an index within the current string in `s`, `c0` is incremented by one since the current character is '0' (and is still not equal to `n`), `c1` is unchanged, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0, `ans` is 1, `leftp` is \(2^j\)**:*
