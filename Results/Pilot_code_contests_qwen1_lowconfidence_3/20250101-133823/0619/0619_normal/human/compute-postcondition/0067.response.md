The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `mx1`. This assignment does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `s`, `j`, `c0`, `c1`, or `mx0`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is an index within the current string in `s`, `c0` is incremented by the number of '0's encountered in the string up to index `j` (but `c0` is not equal to `n`), `c1` is incremented by the number of '1's encountered in the string up to index `j`, `mx0` is `0`, `mx1` is `0`.**
