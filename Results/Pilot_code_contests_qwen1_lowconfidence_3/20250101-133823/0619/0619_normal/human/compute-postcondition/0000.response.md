The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means `n` will now hold the integer value entered by the user, which is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The list `a` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it in this snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive); `a` is a list of integers containing `n` elements where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 2^30-1.**
