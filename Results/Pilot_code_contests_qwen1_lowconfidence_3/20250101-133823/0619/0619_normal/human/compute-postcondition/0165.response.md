The code `mx1 = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `mx1`. This is the only change made to the variables. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 29, `ans` is set based on conditions involving `c0` and `c1`, `ansl` and `ansr` are calculated and possibly updated based on certain conditions; `c1` is less than `n`, and the character at index `i` and position `j` in `s` is not '0', `c0` is not equal to `n`; `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0**
