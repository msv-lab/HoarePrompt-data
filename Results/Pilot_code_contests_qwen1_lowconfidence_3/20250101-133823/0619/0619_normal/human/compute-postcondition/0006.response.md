Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the current state step by step.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while len(ts) < 32:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The current state before the loop is:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\)
- `a` is a list of integers containing `n` elements
- `s` is an empty list
- `ts` is the reversed binary representation of `a[0]` without the '0b' prefix

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `len(ts) < 32` must be true. This means that the length of `ts` must be less than 32.

Currently, `ts` is the reversed binary representation of `a[0]` without the '0b' prefix. The maximum number of bits in `a[0]` (which is an integer) is 31 bits because `n` is between 1 and \(10^5\) and the maximum value of `a[0]` could be \(10^5 - 1\), which is a 17-bit number (since \(2^{17} > 10^5\)). However, the problem specifies that `ts` is the reversed binary representation of `a[0]`, so we need to consider the length of this string.

Given that `a[0]` is an integer, the maximum length of `ts` is 31 bits. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(ts)` must be less than 32, which is already satisfied since the maximum length of `ts` is 31.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to ensure that the loop can execute at least once.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `a` is a list of integers containing `n` elements, `s` is an empty list, `ts` is the reversed binary representation of `a[0]` without the '0b' prefix**
