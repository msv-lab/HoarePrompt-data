`leftp` is left-shifted by `j`. Given that `j` is 29, `leftp` will be `1 << 29`, which means `leftp` is now \(2^{29}\). The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 29, `ans` includes the character '1' appended to its previous value, `leftp` is \(2^{29}\), `ansl` and `ansr` are calculated and possibly updated based on certain conditions, `c1` is less than `n`, the character at index `i` and position `j` in `s` is not '0', `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0.
