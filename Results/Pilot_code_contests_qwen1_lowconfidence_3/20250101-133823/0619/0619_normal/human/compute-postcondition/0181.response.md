The provided code snippet is a part of a larger context and modifies the value of `mx1`. However, without the full context, we cannot determine the exact values of `mx1` and `s` before this line of code is executed. We can only describe the operation performed on `mx1`.

The code updates `mx1` to be the maximum of its current value and the integer value of the reversed substring from `s[i][:j]`. Here, `[::-1]` reverses the substring.

Given the initial state does not provide specific values for `mx1` and `s`, we can only say that `mx1` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the integer value of the reversed substring from `s[i][:j]`.

Output State: **`mx1` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the integer value of the reversed substring from `s[i][:j]`**
