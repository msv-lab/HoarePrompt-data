The variable `ts` is a string representing the reversed binary representation of `i` without the '0b' prefix and appended with '0'. The code snippet `ts += '0'` appends a '0' to the end of `ts`. Since `ts` was already a string of length less than 32, appending a '0' increases its length by 1. The lengths of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `a` is a list of integers containing `n` elements, `s` is a list containing one element, which is a list of 32 '0' characters, `ts` is the reversed binary representation of `i` without the '0b' prefix and appended with '00', and `i` is an integer whose binary representation (after reversal) has fewer than 32 bits, and `len(ts)` is now equal to `len(ts) + 1` and less than 32.**
