According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, making it 1. Additionally, since `n` is greater than 0, it still satisfies the condition for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is an index within the current string in `s`.**
