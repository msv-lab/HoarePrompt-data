`c1` is incremented by 1, which means `c1` is now `c1 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`total` is not mentioned, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 29, `c0` is 0, `c1` is `c1 + 1`, `ans` is set based on conditions involving `c0` and `c1`, `ansl` and `ansr` are calculated and possibly updated based on certain conditions, `s[i][j]` is not equal to '0'**
