`c1` is incremented by 1. The value of `c1` was previously determined by the condition `s[i][j] == '0'`. Since `j` is 29, the condition will either increment `c1` if `s[i][29] == '0'` or leave it unchanged if `s[i][29] != '0'`. However, regardless of the initial value of `c1`, it is now incremented by 1. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `n` is a positive integer; `s` is a list of strings; `j` is 29; `ans` is set based on conditions involving `c0` and `c1`; `c0` remains unchanged or incremented if `s[i][29] == '0'`; `c1` is incremented by 1.**
