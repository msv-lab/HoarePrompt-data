The code `leftp <<= j` updates the value of `leftp` by shifting its bits to the left by `j` positions. Given that `j` is an index within the current string in `s`, and assuming `j` is a non-negative integer, the value of `leftp` is updated accordingly.

Since the initial value of `leftp` is `1`, shifting `1` (`0001` in binary) to the left by `j` positions will result in `2^j`. Therefore, `leftp` becomes `2^j`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is an index within the current string in `s`, `c0` is incremented by the number of '0's encountered in the string up to index `j` (but `c0` is not equal to `n`), `c1` is incremented by the number of '1's encountered in the string up to index `j`, `mx0` is `0`, `mx1` is `0`, `ans` is `1`, `leftp` is `2^j`**
