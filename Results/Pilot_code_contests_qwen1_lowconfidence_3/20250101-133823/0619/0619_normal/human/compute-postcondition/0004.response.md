The code `ts = bin(i)[2:]` is incomplete because `i` is not defined in the given context. However, assuming the intention was to convert an element from the list `a` (since `i` would likely be an index into `a`) to its binary representation and remove the '0b' prefix, let's proceed step by step.

1. The initial state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `a` is a list of integers containing `n` elements, `s` is an empty list.
2. The code `ts = bin(i)[2:]` implies that `i` should be an index into the list `a`. Since `i` is not defined, let's assume `i` is an index into `a` and `a[i]` is some integer. The expression `bin(a[i])` converts `a[i]` to its binary string representation, and `[2:]` removes the '0b' prefix.

Since `i` is not specified, let's consider a specific example where `i = 0` for simplicity. In this case:
- `a[0]` is an integer.
- `bin(a[0])` converts `a[0]` to its binary string representation.
- Removing the '0b' prefix gives us `ts`.

For example, if `a[0]` is 5, then `bin(5)` is '0b101', and `ts = '101'`.

Given this, the updated state would be:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers containing `n` elements.
- `s` is an empty list.
- A new variable `ts` is created and is set to the binary representation of `a[0]` without the '0b' prefix.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `a` is a list of integers containing `n` elements, `s` is an empty list, `ts` is the binary representation of `a[0]` without the '0b' prefix**.
