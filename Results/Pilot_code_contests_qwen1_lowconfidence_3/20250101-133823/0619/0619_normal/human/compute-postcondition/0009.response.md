`ts` is assigned the value of `'0'` using the `+=` operator, which concatenates the string `'0'` to the existing value of `ts`. Since `ts` was initially an empty list, concatenating a string to a list is not a valid operation in Python. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume the intention was to append the string `'0'` to `ts` using the `+` operator.

So, the updated value of `ts` will be `['0']`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `a` is a list of integers containing `n` elements, `s` is an empty list, `ts` is `['0']`**
