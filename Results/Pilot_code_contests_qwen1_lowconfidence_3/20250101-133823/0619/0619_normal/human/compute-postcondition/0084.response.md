Postcondition: ***`i` is 2; `n` is a positive integer; `s` is a list of strings; `j` is an index within the current string in `s`; `c0` is incremented by one if the current character is '0'; `c1` is incremented by the number of '1's encountered in the string up to index `j` (but `c0` is not equal to `n`); `mx0` is the maximum of its previous value and 5 or the current value; `mx1` is the maximum of its current value and the integer representation of the reversed substring `s[2][:j]` if the current character is not '0', or remains the same if the current character is '0'; `ans` is 1; `leftp` is \(2^j\).***
