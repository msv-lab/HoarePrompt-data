The code `mx0 = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `mx0`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is an index within the current string in `s`, `c0` is incremented by the number of '0's encountered in the string up to index `j` (but `c0` is not equal to `n`), `c1` is incremented by the number of '1's encountered in the string up to index `j`, and `mx0` is `0`.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is an index within the current string in `s`, `c0` is incremented by the number of '0's encountered in the string up to index `j` (but `c0` is not equal to `n`), `c1` is incremented by the number of '1's encountered in the string up to index `j`, `mx0` is `0`**
