`m1` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `ansr` XOR `i`. The value of `i` is the next element in the iterable `a`, and `m0` is also updated to the maximum of its current value and `ansr` XOR `i`. Therefore, both `m1` and `m0` are updated to the maximum of their current values and `ansr` XOR the next element in `a`.

Output State: **`m0` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `ansr` ^ `i`; `m1` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `ansr` ^ `i`; `a` is a non-empty iterable.**
