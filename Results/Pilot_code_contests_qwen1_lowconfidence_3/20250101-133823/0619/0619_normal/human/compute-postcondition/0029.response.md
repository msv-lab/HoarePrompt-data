The code `ts += '0'` appends the string `'0'` to the end of the string stored in `ts`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `ts`, we assume it is an empty string (`''`) unless otherwise stated. After appending `'0'` to an empty string, `ts` becomes `'0'`.

Output State: **`ts` is `'0'`**
