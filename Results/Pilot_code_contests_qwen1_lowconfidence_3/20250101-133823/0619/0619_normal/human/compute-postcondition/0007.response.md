`ts` is the reversed binary representation of `a[0]` without the '0b' prefix, and it is a string. The code appends '0' to `ts`. Therefore, `ts` becomes the previous value of `ts` plus '0'. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `a` is a list of integers containing `n` elements, `s` is an empty list, `ts` is the reversed binary representation of `a[0]` without the '0b' prefix plus '0'**
