Postcondition: **`i` is either `n-1` or `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is an index within the current string in `s`. If `c1` equals `n`, then `c0` is incremented by the number of '0's encountered in the string up to index `j`, and `ans` includes `'1'`. Otherwise, `c0` is the total count of '0's encountered in all strings up to the `j`-th index of the last string (but `c0` is not equal to `n`), `c1` is the total count of '1's encountered in all strings up to the `j`-th index, `mx0` is the maximum decimal value of the reversed binary substrings of all strings up to the `j`-th index where the corresponding character is '0', `mx1` is the maximum decimal value of the reversed binary substrings of all strings up to the `j`-th index where the corresponding character is '1', `ans` is `2^j + mx0`, `ansr` is `2^j + mx1`, and the loop breaks.**
