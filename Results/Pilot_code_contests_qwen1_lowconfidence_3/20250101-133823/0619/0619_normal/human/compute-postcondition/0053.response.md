The variable `c1` is incremented by 1, and its initial value was 0 (since it's not mentioned otherwise). The other variables (`i`, `n`, `s`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is an index within the current string in `s`, `c1` is 1**
