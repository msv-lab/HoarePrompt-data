Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is an index within the current string in `s`, `c0` is incremented by one if the current character is '0', `c1` is incremented by the number of '1's encountered in the string up to index `j` (but `c0` is not equal to `n`), `mx0` is 5 if the current character is '0', `mx1` is the decimal value of the binary string `sub_str[::-1]` if the current character is '1', `ans` is 1, `leftp` is \(2^j\).***
