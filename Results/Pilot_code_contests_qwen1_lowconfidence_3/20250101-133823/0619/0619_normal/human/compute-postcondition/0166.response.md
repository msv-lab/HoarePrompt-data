The code `ans += '1'` appends the character '1' to the string stored in `ans`. The previous value of `ans` was based on conditions involving `c0` and `c1`, but the exact value is not specified. However, the specific value of `ans` after this operation is that it now includes the character '1' appended to whatever it previously contained.

Other variables remain unchanged from their initial state:
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is a positive integer
- `s` is a list of strings
- `j` is 29
- `ansl` and `ansr` are calculated and possibly updated based on certain conditions
- `c1` is less than `n`
- The character at index `i` and position `j` in `s` is not '0'
- `c0` is not equal to `n`
- `mx0` is 0
- `mx1` is 0

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 29, `ans` includes the character '1' appended to its previous value, `ansl` and `ansr` are calculated and possibly updated based on certain conditions, `c1` is less than `n`, the character at index `i` and position `j` in `s` is not '0', `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0**
