Postcondition: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 30, `c0` is the count of '0' at index `j` across all strings in `s`, `c1` is the count of '1' at index `j` across all strings in `s`, `mx0` is 0, and `mx1` is the binary value of `s[i][:j][::-1]` if `s[i][j]` is not '0'. Otherwise, `mx0` remains 0 and `mx1` remains 0.**
