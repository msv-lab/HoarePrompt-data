The code `print(a1)` simply prints the value of `a1`. This does not change the value of `a1` or any other variables; it only outputs the current value of `a1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is the maximum value obtained by taking the bitwise XOR of `leftp` with each element in the list `a`, `leftp` is the integer value of `ans` in base 2, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `ans` is constructed based on the conditions involving `c0` and `c1`, `ansl` equals -1, `ansr` is \(2^{31} + mx1\), and `a1` is printed.**
