Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 29, `ans` includes the character '1' appended to its previous value, `leftp` is \(2^{29}\), `ansl` and `ansr` are calculated and possibly updated based on certain conditions, `c1` is less than `n`, `mx0` is the maximum value among all `mx0` updates where the character at index `i` and position `j` in `s` is '0', `mx1` is the maximum value among all `mx1` updates where the character at index `i` and position `j` in `s` is '1'.**

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: Initially, `i` is `n`, and the loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`.
- **Loop Execution**:
  - For each iteration, the loop checks if the character at index `i` and position `j` in `s` is '0'.
  - If it is '0', `mx0` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the integer value of the reversed substring from `s[i][:j]` (interpreted in binary).
  - If it is '1', `mx1` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the integer value of the reversed substring from `s[i][:j]` (interpreted in binary).
- **Final Values**:
  - After all iterations, `mx0` will hold the maximum value among all the `mx0` updates where the condition `s[i][j] == '0'` was true.
  - Similarly, `mx1` will hold the maximum value among all the `mx1` updates where the condition `s[i][j] == '1'` was true.
  
### Summary:
- The loop processes all elements of the list `s` up to index `n-1`.
- It updates `mx0` and `mx1` based on the characters '0' and '1' respectively at the specified position `j` in each string.
- The final values of `mx0` and `mx1` represent the maximum binary values derived from the substrings that meet the respective conditions.
