Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is an index within the current string in `s`, `c0` is incremented by the number of '0's encountered in the string up to index `j` (but `c0` is not equal to `n`), `c1` is incremented by the number of '1's encountered in the string up to index `j`, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0, `ans` is 1, `leftp` is \(2^j\), and the character at `s[i][j]` is not '0'**
