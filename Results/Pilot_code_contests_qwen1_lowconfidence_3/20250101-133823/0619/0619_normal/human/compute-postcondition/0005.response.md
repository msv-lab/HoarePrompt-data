The code `ts = ts[::-1]` reverses the string `ts`. Initially, `ts` is the binary representation of `a[0]` without the '0b' prefix. Reversing this string changes its order but does not affect the values of other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `a` is a list of integers containing `n` elements, `s` is an empty list, `ts` is the reversed binary representation of `a[0]` without the '0b' prefix**
