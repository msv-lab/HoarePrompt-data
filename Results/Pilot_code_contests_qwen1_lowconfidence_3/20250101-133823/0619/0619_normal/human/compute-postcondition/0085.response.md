Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is an index within the current string in `s`, `c0` is the total count of '0's encountered in all strings up to the `j`-th index of the last string (but `c0` is not equal to `n`), `c1` is the total count of '1's encountered in all strings up to the `j`-th index, `mx0` is the maximum decimal value of the reversed binary substrings of all strings up to the `j`-th index where the corresponding character is '0', `mx1` is the maximum decimal value of the reversed binary substrings of all strings up to the `j`-th index where the corresponding character is '1', `ans` is 1, `leftp` is \(2^j\).**
