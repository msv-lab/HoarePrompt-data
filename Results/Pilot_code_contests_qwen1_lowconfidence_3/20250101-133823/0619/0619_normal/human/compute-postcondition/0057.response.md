`c1` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `c1` is not specified. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is an index within the current string in `s`, `c1` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is an index within the current string in `s`, `c1` is incremented by 1**
