Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `a1` is the maximum of its original value and `leftp ^ i`.
   - `leftp` is unchanged.
   - `i` is unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition**: The for loop is defined as `for i in a`. This means `i` iterates over the elements of the list `a`.

3. **Iteration Progress**: Since `i` is unchanged from the previous iteration, it implies that the current value of `i` is still the same as the value it had at the start of the previous iteration. 

4. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be an element of the list `a` that hasn't been processed yet. Given that `i` is unchanged, it suggests that the next value of `i` will be the next element in the list `a`.

5. **Updating States**:
   - `a1` remains the maximum of its original value and `leftp ^ i` because the value of `i` is unchanged and the loop body (which we assume updates `a1`) hasn't run yet.
   - `leftp` remains unchanged.
   - `i` will now be set to the next element in the list `a`.

Given these points, the updated states for the start of the next iteration would be:

- `a1` is the maximum of its original value and `leftp ^ i`.
- `leftp` is unchanged.
- `i` is now the next element in the list `a`.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a1` is the maximum of its original value and `leftp ^ i`, `leftp` is unchanged, `i` is the next element in the list `a`**
