The code updates the variable `ansr` by setting it to the value of `leftp + mx1`. Let's break down the impact:

- `ansr` is now set to `leftp + mx1`.
- The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `s`, `j`, `ans`, `leftp`, `ansl`, `ansr`, `c1`, and `mx0`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 29, `ans` includes the character '1' appended to its previous value, `leftp` is \(2^{29}\), `ansl` is \(2^{29} + mx0\), `ansr` is `leftp + mx1`, `c1` is less than `n`, `mx0` is the maximum value among all `mx0` updates where the character at index `i` and position `j` in `s` is '0', `mx1` is the maximum value among all `mx1` updates where the character at index `i` and position `j` in `s` is '1'.**
