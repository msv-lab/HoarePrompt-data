The code `a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, representing the number of elements in the list `a`.

Since the input is split and converted to integers, the value of `n` is not directly used in this code snippet, but it determines the length of the list `a`. The list `a` now contains `n` integers.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive); `a` is a list of integers containing `n` elements**
