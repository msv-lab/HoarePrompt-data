The code snippet `ans += '1'` appends the character '1' to the string stored in the variable `ans`. Given the initial state where `ans` is initially an empty string (`''`), appending '1' to it will change `ans` to `'1'`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is an index within the current string in `s`, `c0` is incremented by the number of '0's encountered in the string up to index `j` (but `c0` is not equal to `n`), `c1` is incremented by the number of '1's encountered in the string up to index `j`, `mx0` is `0`, `mx1` is `0`, `ans` is `'1'`**
