`ans` is assigned the value `'1'` by incrementing it by `'1'`. Since `ans` was initially an empty string (`''`), adding `'1'` to it results in `'1'`. The values of other variables such as `i`, `n`, `s`, `j`, `c0`, and `c1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 30, `c0` is the count of '0' at index `j` across all strings in `s`, `c1` is the count of '1' at index `j` across all strings in `s`, `c1` is equal to `n`, and `ans` is `'1'`**.
