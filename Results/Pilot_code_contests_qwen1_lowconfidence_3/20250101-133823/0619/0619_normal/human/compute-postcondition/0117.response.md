`ans` is assigned the value `'1'`. The previous value of `ans` was not specified, but it is added to with the character `'1'`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 30, `c0` is the count of '0' at index `j` across all strings in `s`, `c1` is the count of '1' at index `j` across all strings in `s`, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0, and `ans` is now the original value of `ans` plus `'1'`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 30, `c0` is the count of '0' at index `j` across all strings in `s`, `c1` is the count of '1' at index `j` across all strings in `s`, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0, and `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `'1'`**
