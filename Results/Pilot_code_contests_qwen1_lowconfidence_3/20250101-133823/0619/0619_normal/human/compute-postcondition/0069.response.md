The code `leftp = int(ans, 2)` converts the string `ans` from binary to an integer. Given that `ans` is `'1'`, converting it to an integer results in `1`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is an index within the current string in `s`, `c0` is incremented by the number of '0's encountered in the string up to index `j` (but `c0` is not equal to `n`), `c1` is incremented by the number of '1's encountered in the string up to index `j`, `mx0` is `0`, `mx1` is `0`, `ans` is `1`, `leftp` is `1`**
