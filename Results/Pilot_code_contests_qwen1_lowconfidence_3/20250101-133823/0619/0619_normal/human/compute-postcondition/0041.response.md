`ansr` is assigned the value `-1`. The value of `ansr` is now explicitly set to `-1`, and this assignment does not affect any other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `a` is a list of integers containing `n` elements, `s` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a string of 32 '0' characters, `ts` is a string of 32 '0' characters, `ans` is an empty string, `ansl` is -1, `i` does not exist if the loop does not execute, or `i` is the last element processed in the list `a` if the loop executes; `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0, `ansr` is -1.**
