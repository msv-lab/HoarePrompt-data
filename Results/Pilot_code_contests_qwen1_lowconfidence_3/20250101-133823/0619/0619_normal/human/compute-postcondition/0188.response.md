Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 29, `ans` is updated based on the conditions involving `c0` and `c1`. If `c1` equals `n`, `ans` is `ans` plus '1'. Otherwise, if `c0` equals `n`, `ans` has an additional '0' appended to its previous value. Otherwise, `ans` includes the character '1' appended to its previous value. `leftp` is \(2^{29}\), `ansl` is \(2^{29} + mx0\), and `ansr` is `leftp + mx1`, where `mx0` is the maximum value among all `mx0` updates where the character at index `i` and position `j` in `s` is '0', and `mx1` is the maximum value among all `mx1` updates where the character at index `i` and position `j` in `s` is '1'.**
