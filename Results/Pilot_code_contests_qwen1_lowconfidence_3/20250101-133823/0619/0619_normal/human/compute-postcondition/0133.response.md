Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 30, `c0` is the count of '0' at index `j` across all strings in `s`, `c1` is the count of '1' at index `j` across all strings in `s`. If `s[i][j]` is '0', `mx0` is the maximum of its current value and the binary value of the reversed substring `s[i][:j][::-1]`. Otherwise, `mx1` is the maximum value between its original value and the decimal equivalent of the binary substring of `s[i]` from the start to `j` (inclusive), reversed.***
