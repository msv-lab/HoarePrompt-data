The code updates `a1` to be the maximum of its current value and `leftp ^ i`. The values of `leftp` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.

- `a1` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `leftp ^ i`.
- `leftp` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`a1` is the maximum of its original value and `leftp ^ i`, `leftp` is unchanged, `i` is the next element in the list `a`**
