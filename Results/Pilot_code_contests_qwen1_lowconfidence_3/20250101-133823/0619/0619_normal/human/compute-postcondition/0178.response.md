Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 29, `ans` includes the character '1' appended to its previous value, `leftp` is \(2^{29}\), `ansl` and `ansr` are calculated and possibly updated based on certain conditions, `c1` is less than `n`. If `s[1][29]` is '0', `mx0` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 85, `mx1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `mx1` is updated to the maximum of its current value and 85, `mx0` remains unchanged.***
