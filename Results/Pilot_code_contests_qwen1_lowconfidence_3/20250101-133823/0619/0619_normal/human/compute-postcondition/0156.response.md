Postcondition: ***`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 29, `ans` is set based on conditions involving `c0` and `c1`, `ansl` and `ansr` are calculated and possibly updated based on certain conditions; if `s[i][j] == '0'`, then `c0` is incremented by 1, otherwise `c1` is incremented by 1.***

Explanation:
- The overall postcondition includes all the variables and their states as described in both the if and else parts.
- If `s[i][j] == '0'`, then `c0` is incremented by 1, which is covered in the if part.
- If `s[i][j] != '0'`, then `c1` is incremented by 1, which is covered in the else part.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `s`, `j`, `ans`, `ansl`, `ansr`) remain in their respective states as described in the precondition, as they are not modified in either the if or else part.
