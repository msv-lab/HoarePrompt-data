Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 30, `c0` is the count of '0' at index `j` across all strings in `s`, `c1` is the count of '1' at index `j` across all strings in `s`. If `c1` equals `n`, `ans` is `'1'`. Otherwise, if `c0` equals `n` and `c1` does not equal `n`, `ans` is `'0'`. Additionally, if `c0` does not equal `n` and `c1` does not equal `n`, the maximum value among the binary values of the reversed substrings for each '0' is stored in `ansl` as `leftp + mx0`, the maximum value among the decimal equivalents of the reversed substrings for each '1' is stored in `ansr` as `leftp + mx1`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
