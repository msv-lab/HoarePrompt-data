Postcondition: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 30, `c0` is the count of '0' at index `j` across all strings in `s`, `c1` is the count of '1' at index `j` across all strings in `s`. If `s[i][j]` is '0', then `mx0` remains 0. Otherwise, `mx0` is the binary value of `s[i][:j][::-1]`, and `mx1` is the maximum of `mx1` and the integer value of `s[i][:j][::-1]`.**
