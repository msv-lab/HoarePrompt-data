`j` and `c0` are not affected by the code. The value of `c1` is incremented by 1. Since `c1` was initially 1 if `s[0][30]` is '0' else 2, after executing `c1 += 1`, the new value of `c1` will be 2 if `s[0][30]` is '0' else 3.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `j` is 30, `c0` is 1 if `s[0][30]` is '0' else 0, `c1` is 2 if `s[0][30]` is '0' else 3**
