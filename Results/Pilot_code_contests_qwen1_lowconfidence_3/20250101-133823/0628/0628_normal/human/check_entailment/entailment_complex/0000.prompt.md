You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Little Elephant very much loves sums on intervals.

This time he has a pair of integers l and r (l ≤ r). The Little Elephant has to find the number of such integers x (l ≤ x ≤ r), that the first digit of integer x equals the last one (in decimal notation). For example, such numbers as 101, 477474 or 9 will be included in the answer and 47, 253 or 1020 will not.

Help him and count the number of described numbers x for a given pair l and r.

Input

The single line contains a pair of integers l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 1018) — the boundaries of the interval.

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

Output

On a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem.

Examples

Input

2 47


Output

12


Input

47 1024


Output

98

Note

In the first sample the answer includes integers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44. 
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18.
def func_1():
    lower, upper = map(int, raw_input().split())
    res = 0
    for val in range(1, 10):
        if lower <= val <= upper:
            res += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lower` is an input integer, `upper` is an input integer, `res` is the count of integers between `lower` and `upper` inclusive.
    for length in range(2, 19):
        for startend in range(1, 10):
            alreadyval = startend * pow(10, length - 1) + (0 if length == 1 else
                startend)
            smallestpos = max(0, (lower - alreadyval + 9) / 10)
            largestpos = min(pow(10, length - 2) - 1, (upper - alreadyval) / 10)
            res += max(0, largestpos - smallestpos + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `length` is 19, `startend` is 9, `alreadyval` is \(9 \times 10^{18} + 9\), `smallestpos` is \(max(0, (lower - 9 \times 10^{18}) / 10)\), `largestpos` is \(min(10^{17} - 1, (upper - 9 \times 10^{18} - 9) / 10)\), `res` is the total count of valid integers between `lower` and `upper`.
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters `lower` and `upper`, both non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq lower \leq upper \leq 10^{18}\). It calculates and returns the count of integers within the range `[lower, upper]` that can be represented using exactly 19 digits. This includes numbers from \(10^{18}\) to \(9999999999999999999\) (i.e., 19-digit numbers).

The function performs the following steps:
1. It initializes `res` to 0.
2. It counts the number of single-digit integers (1 through 9) that fall within the range `[lower, upper]`.
3. For each digit length from 2 to 19, it iterates over all possible starting digits (from 1 to 9).
4. For each starting digit and length, it calculates the smallest and largest positions of numbers that fit within the given range.
5. It updates `res` by adding the count of valid numbers for each combination of length and starting digit.

The function handles edge cases such as when `lower` or `upper` is less than \(10^{18}\) or greater than \(9999999999999999999\). If `lower` or `upper` is outside the valid range, the function will still execute but the counts will only consider the valid portion of the range.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
