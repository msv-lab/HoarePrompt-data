State at the end of the previous iteration: `length` is 18.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The for loop iterates over the range from 2 to 18 inclusive.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `length` is 18.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `length` needs to be within the range of 2 to 18 (inclusive).
4. Since the current range is from 2 to 18, the next value of `length` would be 19 if the loop were to continue, but it should remain within the range to ensure the loop continues.

Given the current state and the condition for the loop to continue, `length` must be set to 19 to proceed to the next iteration.

State: **`length` is 19**
