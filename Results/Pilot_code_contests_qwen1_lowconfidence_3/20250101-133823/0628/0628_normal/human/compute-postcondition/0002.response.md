State: **`lower` is an input integer, `upper` is an input integer, `res` is 0, `val` is 1, `val` must be less than 10**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Loop Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop variable `val` is being assigned values from the range `1` to `9` (inclusive) because `range(1, 10)` generates numbers from 1 to 9.
   - For each iteration, `val` must be less than 10 to continue the loop.

2. **Initial Values and Loop Execution:**
   - Initially, `val` is not set to any value within the loop; it will start from the beginning of the range (1).
   - Since `val` starts from 1 and increases by 1 until it reaches 9, the condition `val < 10` must hold true for the loop to continue executing.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `lower` and `upper` are given as input integers but do not directly affect the loop's execution condition.
   - `res` is initialized to 0 but does not impact the loop's execution condition either.

4. **Loop Initialization:**
   - To ensure the loop starts, `val` must be set to 1 at the start of the loop.

### Conclusion:
The loop can execute if `val` is set to 1 and remains less than 10 during each iteration. Therefore, the initial state must include these conditions.
