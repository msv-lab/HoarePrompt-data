Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Loop Variables and Conditions**:
   - The loop variable is `length`.
   - The loop runs from `2` to `19` (inclusive) because `range(2, 19)` generates values from `2` to `18`.

2. **Determine Necessary States**:
   - For the loop to execute, the value of `length` must be within the specified range (`2` to `18`).
   - The initial value of `length` should be `2` since the loop starts at `2`.

3. **Consider Initial States**:
   - `lower` is an input integer.
   - `upper` is an input integer.
   - `res` is the count of integers between `lower` and `upper` inclusive.

4. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `length` is less than `19`.
   - Initially, `length` must be set to `2`.

### Formulate the Final State

Based on the analysis, the necessary states to ensure the loop can execute are:

- `length` must be `2`.
- `lower` is an input integer.
- `upper` is an input integer.

### Final Answer

State: **`length` is 2, `lower` is an input integer, `upper` is an input integer**
