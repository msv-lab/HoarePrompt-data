The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`. Both `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\). The function does not return an explicit value based on the given information, but rather the parameters define a range.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `l` and `r`, where both are non-negative integers and satisfy the condition \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\).

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, where both are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\).**
