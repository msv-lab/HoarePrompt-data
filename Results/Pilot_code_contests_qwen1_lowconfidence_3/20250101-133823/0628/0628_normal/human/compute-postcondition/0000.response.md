The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to the variables `lower` and `upper`. Since the initial values of `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\), the new values of `lower` and `upper` will replace the initial values of `l` and `r`. The preconditions that `l` and `r` are non-negative integers and \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) no longer apply.

Output State: **`lower` is an input integer, `upper` is an input integer**
