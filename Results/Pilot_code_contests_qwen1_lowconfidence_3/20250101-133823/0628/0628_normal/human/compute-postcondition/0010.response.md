`res` is incremented by 1 if the value 9 falls within the range `[lower, upper]`. Since the code simply increments `res` regardless of whether 9 is within the range or not, the value of `res` is increased by 1. The values of `lower`, `upper`, and `val` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lower` is an input integer, `upper` is an input integer, `res` is increased by 1, and `val` is 10**
