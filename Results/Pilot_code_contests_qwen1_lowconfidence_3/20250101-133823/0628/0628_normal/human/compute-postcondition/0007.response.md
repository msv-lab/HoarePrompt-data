`res` is incremented by 1 if the value 9 falls within the range `[lower, upper]`. Since the exact values of `lower` and `upper` are not specified, we cannot determine if 9 falls within this range. However, `res` is guaranteed to be incremented by 1 regardless of whether 9 is in the range or not.

Output State: **`lower` is an input integer, `upper` is an input integer, `res` is incremented by 1**
