Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `length` is 20
- `startend` must be in the range [1, 9]
- `alreadyval` is `startend * 10^19 + startend`
- `smallestpos` is `max(0, (lower - (startend * 10^19 + startend) + 9) / 10)`
- `largestpos` is `min(pow(10, 18) - 1, (upper - alreadyval) / 10)`
- `res` is the original value of `res` plus `max(0, largestpos - smallestpos + 1)`

### Loop Statement:
```
for startend in range(1, 10):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop iterates over `startend` from 1 to 9. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- The current value of `startend` is some number between 1 and 9 (inclusive).
- We need to determine the new state of all variables before the next iteration starts.

### Steps to Determine New State:
1. **Increment `startend`:**
   - Since the loop increments `startend` by 1, the next value of `startend` will be `startend + 1`.
   
2. **Check Range Constraint:**
   - The value of `startend` must remain within the range [1, 9]. Therefore, if `startend` is currently 9, it will wrap around to 1 for the next iteration.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `length`, `lower`, `upper`, and `res` do not change within the loop body as no information is given about their modification inside the loop.

### Updated State:
Given the loop will start the next iteration with `startend` incremented by 1, we need to adjust the state accordingly. If `startend` was 9, it will reset to 1 for the next iteration. For any other value of `startend`, it will simply increment by 1.

#### Example Scenarios:
- If `startend` was 9, it becomes 1.
- If `startend` was 5, it becomes 6.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact initial value of `startend` is not specified, we can generalize the state update rule.

#### Generalized State Update:
- `length` remains 20.
- `startend` will be the next value in the sequence from 1 to 9 (it wraps around if it reaches 10).
- All other variables (`alreadyval`, `smallestpos`, `largestpos`, and `res`) remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`length` is 20, `startend` is the next value in the sequence from 1 to 9 (it wraps around if it reaches 10), `alreadyval` is `startend * 10^19 + startend`, `smallestpos` is `max(0, (lower - (startend * 10^19 + startend) + 9) / 10)`, `largestpos` is `min(pow(10, 18) - 1, (upper - alreadyval) / 10)`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `max(0, largestpos - smallestpos + 1)`**.
