`res` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `res` is now `res + 1`. The other variables (`lower`, `upper`, `val`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `lower` is an input integer, `upper` is an input integer, `res` is `res + 1`, `val` is 1 and less than 10.

Output State: **`lower` is an input integer, `upper` is an input integer, `res` is `res + 1`, `val` is 1 and less than 10**
