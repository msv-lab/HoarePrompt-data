Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the code only checks for one pattern of alternating colors and does not account for the scenario where the initial arrangement of cockroaches already alternates perfectly.

For example, consider the input:

```
3
rbr
```

The output should be `0` because the cockroaches are already in an alternating pattern. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly. It would need to check both possible alternating patterns ('b'r'b' and 'r'b'r') and choose the one with the minimum number of changes.

To fix this, the code should include logic to check both patterns and determine the minimum number of changes required for each, then return the minimum of these two values.
