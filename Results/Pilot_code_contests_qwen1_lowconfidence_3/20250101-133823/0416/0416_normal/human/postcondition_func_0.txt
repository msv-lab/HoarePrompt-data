The function processes an input consisting of two lines: the first line is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) representing the number of cockroaches, and the second line is a string of length `n` containing characters 'b' and 'r'. It calculates the minimum number of swaps required to ensure that all black cockroaches ('b') are at even indices and all red cockroaches ('r') are at odd indices. The function then prints this minimum number of swaps.
