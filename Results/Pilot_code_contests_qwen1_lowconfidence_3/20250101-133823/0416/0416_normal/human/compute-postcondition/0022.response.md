`swaps` is assigned the value of `min(change_red, change_black)`. This means `swaps` will take the minimum value between `change_red` and `change_black`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `line`, `change_black`, and `change_red`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `line` is a non-empty string, `change_black` is the number of 'b' characters at even indices, `change_red` is the number of 'r' characters at odd indices, `swaps` is the minimum value between `change_red` and `change_black`.**
