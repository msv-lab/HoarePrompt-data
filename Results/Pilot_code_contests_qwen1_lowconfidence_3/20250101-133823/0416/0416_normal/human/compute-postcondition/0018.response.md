Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000; `line` is a non-empty string; if the new index `idx` (which is the previous `idx` + 1) is even and the value `val` is 'b', `change_black` is incremented by 1; if the new index `idx` is odd and the value `val` is 'r', `change_black` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `change_black` remains unchanged. `change_red` remains unchanged.***
