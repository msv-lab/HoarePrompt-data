To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000.
- `line` is a non-empty string.
- `change_black` is the number of 'b' characters at even indices.
- `change_red` is the number of 'r' characters at odd indices.
- `swaps` is the minimum value between `change_red` and `change_black`.
- `color` is calculated based on the condition: `change_red - min(change_red, change_black)` if `change_red >= change_black` else `change_black - min(change_red, change_black)`.
- `total` is the sum of `swaps` and `color`.
- `change_red2` is 0.
- `change_black2` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (idx, val) in enumerate(line):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **`line` is a non-empty string**: This ensures the loop can execute because `enumerate` will iterate over each character in the string.
2. **Loop Variables**:
   - The loop variable `idx` will take values from 0 to the length of the string `line` - 1.
   - The loop variable `val` will take the value of each character in the string `line`.

### State Adjustments:
- Since the loop is iterating over each character in the string `line`, `line` being non-empty is sufficient.
- `idx` will start from 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.
- `val` will take the value of each character in the string `line`.

### Final State Adjustment:
- `line` must be a non-empty string.
- `idx` should start from 0.
- `val` will take the value of each character in the string `line`.

### State after Adjustment:
- `line` is a non-empty string.
- `idx` is 0.
- `val` is the first character in the string `line`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`line` is a non-empty string, `idx` is 0, `val` is the first character in the string `line`**
