`change_red` is incremented by 1, but the value of `idx` and the corresponding value in `line` are not specified, so they remain unchanged. The initial conditions state that `change_black` is incremented under specific conditions related to `idx` and `val`. However, since the code only affects `change_red`, the value of `change_black` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000; `line` is a non-empty string; `change_red` is incremented by 1; `change_black` remains unchanged.**
