`change_black2` is incremented by 1. The value of `idx` is 1 and it is odd, and the value of `val` is 'b'. The state of `line` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `line` is a non-empty string, `idx` is 1, `val` is 'b', and `change_black2` is 1.

Output State: **`line` is a non-empty string, `idx` is 1, `val` is 'b', `change_black2` is 1**
