Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop control variables and their initial values:**
   - The loop uses `enumerate(line)`, meaning `idx` will be the index of the current character in the string `line`, and `val` will be the current character itself.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `line` must contain at least one character because `enumerate` will generate pairs starting from index 0 if `line` is non-empty.

3. **Initial states given:**
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000.
   - `line` is a string input by the user.
   - `change_red` is 0.
   - `change_black` is 0.

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute:**
   - Since `line` is the string being iterated over, and `enumerate` will start from index 0 if `line` is non-empty, we need to ensure that `line` is non-empty.
   - The values of `change_red` and `change_black` are not relevant to the loop execution as they are not used in the loop condition or initialization.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `line` must be a non-empty string.

The final answer is:
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `line` is a non-empty string, `change_red` is 0, `change_black` is 0**
