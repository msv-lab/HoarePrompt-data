Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `line` is a non-empty string, `change_black` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the current index `idx` is even and the value `val` is 'b'. If `idx` is odd and `val` is 'r', then `change_red` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `line`, `change_black`, and `change_red` remain unchanged.***
