According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `line` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `idx` and the value `val` at each step. The loop updates the state based on the conditions specified for `change_black` and `change_red`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000.
- `line` is a non-empty string.
- `change_black` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the current index `idx` is even and the value `val` is 'b'.
- `change_red` is incremented by 1 if `idx` is odd and `val` is 'r'. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `line`, `change_black`, and `change_red` remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The loop needs to process the next character in the string `line`.
- This means the index `idx` will be incremented by 1.
- The value `val` will be the next character in the string `line`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
- `line` remains the same as the previous iteration.
- `change_black` and `change_red` may change based on the new index `idx` and the value `val` of the next character in `line`.

Step-by-step:
1. The index `idx` is increased by 1.
2. The value `val` is now the next character in the string `line`.
3. `change_black` is updated based on whether `idx` is even and `val` is 'b'.
4. `change_red` is updated by incrementing it if `idx` is odd and `val` is 'r'.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `line` is a non-empty string, `change_black` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the new index `idx` is even and the value `val` is 'b', `change_red` is incremented by 1 if the new index `idx` is odd and the value `val` is 'r'**
