The variable `change_black2` is incremented by 1, while the other variables (`line`, `idx`, and `val`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `line` is a non-empty string, `idx` is 1, `val` is the character at index 1 in `line`, and `change_black2` is 1.

Output State: **`line` is a non-empty string, `idx` is 1, `val` is the character at index 1 in `line`, `change_black2` is 1**
