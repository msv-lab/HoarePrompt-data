The code `change_red2 += 1` increments the value of `change_red2` by 1. According to the initial state, `idx` is 1, so `idx % 2 == 1` is true. However, the value of `change_black2` depends on whether `val` is 'b', and the initial state does not specify this. Therefore, the value of `change_black2` remains unchanged unless `val` is 'b'.

Since the value of `change_black2` is not specified and no conditions are met to change it from its initial state, we only update `change_red2`.

Output State: **`line` is a non-empty string, `idx` is 1, `val` is the character at index 1 in `line`, `change_red2` is increased by 1, `change_black2` retains its original value.**
