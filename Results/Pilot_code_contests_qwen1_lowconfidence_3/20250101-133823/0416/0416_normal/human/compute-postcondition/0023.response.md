`color` is assigned the value of `max(change_red, change_black) - swaps`. Since `swaps` is defined as the minimum value between `change_red` and `change_black`, let's denote `change_red` as `r` and `change_black` as `b`. Thus, `swaps = min(r, b)`. 

The value of `color` will be calculated as follows:
- If `r >= b`, then `color = r - min(r, b) = r - b`.
- If `b > r`, then `color = b - min(r, b) = b - r`.

Therefore, the value of `color` depends on whether `change_red` is greater than or equal to `change_black`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `line` is a non-empty string, `change_black` is the number of 'b' characters at even indices, `change_red` is the number of 'r' characters at odd indices, `swaps` is the minimum value between `change_red` and `change_black`, `color` is `change_red - min(change_red, change_black)` if `change_red >= change_black` else `change_black - min(change_red, change_black)`**
