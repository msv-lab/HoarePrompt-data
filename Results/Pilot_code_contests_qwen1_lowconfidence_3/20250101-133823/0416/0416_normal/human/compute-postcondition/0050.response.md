Functionality: **The function processes an input consisting of two lines: the first line is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) representing the number of cockroaches, and the second line is a string of length `n` containing characters 'b' and 'r'. It calculates the minimum number of swaps required to ensure that all black cockroaches ('b') are at even indices and all red cockroaches ('r') are at odd indices. The function then prints this minimum number of swaps.**

**Specifically, the function performs the following actions:**
1. Reads the integer `n` and the string `line` from the input.
2. Counts the number of black cockroaches ('b') at even indices and the number of red cockroaches ('r') at odd indices.
3. Counts the number of black cockroaches ('b') at odd indices and the number of red cockroaches ('r') at even indices.
4. Calculates the minimum number of swaps needed based on the counts from steps 2 and 3.
5. Prints the minimum number of swaps required.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is 1, there is only one cockroach, and no swaps are needed since it can either be at an even or odd index.
- If all cockroaches are already in the correct positions, no swaps are needed.
- If the string `line` is entirely 'b' or 'r', the function still correctly calculates the minimum number of swaps needed.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where the input does not conform to the specified format (e.g., the first line is not a valid integer or the second line is not of length `n`). This should be considered an edge case and should ideally be handled within the function.
