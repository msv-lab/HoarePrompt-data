Postcondition: ***`line` is a non-empty string, `idx` is 2, `val` is 'r', `change_red2` is increased by 2 from its original value, and `change_black2` remains in its original state. Since the else part does not exist or change any variables, the overall postcondition focuses on the if part condition being met.***
