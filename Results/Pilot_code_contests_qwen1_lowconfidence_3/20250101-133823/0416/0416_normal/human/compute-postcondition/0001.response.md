The code `line = raw_input()` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `line`. However, since no specific input is given in the example, we cannot determine the exact content of `line`. But we know that `line` will be a string that the user inputs.

The variable `n` remains unchanged because the code does not modify its value. The initial state of `n` is that it is an integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive).

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive); `line` is a string input by the user**
