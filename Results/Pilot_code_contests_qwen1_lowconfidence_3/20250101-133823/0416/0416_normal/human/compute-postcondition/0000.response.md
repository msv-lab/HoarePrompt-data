`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input from the user and `int` converts it to an integer. This means `n` now holds the number of cockroaches, and the string of cockroaches is yet to be inputted.

Since the code only assigns a value to `n` and does not affect the string of cockroaches or any other variables, the output state remains with the number of cockroaches stored in `n` and the string of cockroaches yet to be inputted.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), representing the number of cockroaches; the string of length `n` consisting of 'b' and 'r' is yet to be inputted**.
