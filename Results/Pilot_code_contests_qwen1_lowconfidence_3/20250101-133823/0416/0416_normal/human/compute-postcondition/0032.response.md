`change_red2` is incremented by 1. Since `idx % 2 == 0` and `val` is 'r', the condition `idx % 2 == 1 and val` is 'b' does not hold true, so `change_black2` remains unchanged. Therefore, the only updated variable is `change_red2`.

Output State: **`line` is a non-empty string, `idx` is either 0 or 1, `val` is the character at index `idx` in `line`, `change_red2` is increased by 1, and `change_black2` remains unchanged.**
