Postcondition: ***`line` is a non-empty string, `idx` is 2, `val` is 'r', `change_red2` is increased by 1 from its original value, and `change_black2` is either its original value (if the condition `idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'b'` is false) or its original value plus 1 (if the condition `idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'b'` is true).***
