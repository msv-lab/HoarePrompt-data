The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user, which consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) representing the number of cockroaches. The second line contains a string of length `n`, consisting of characters 'b' and 'r', where 'b' denotes a black cockroach and 'r' denotes a red cockroach. Based on this input, the function returns a value.
