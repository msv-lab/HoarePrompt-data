`swaps2` is updated to be the sum of `swaps2` (which is the minimum of `change_red2` and `change_black2`) and `color2` (which is `max(change_red2, change_black2) - swaps2`). The values of `change_red2` and `change_black2` remain unchanged, and the value of `color2` also remains unchanged because it is not being reassigned.

Let's break down the calculation:

1. `swaps2` is initially the minimum of `change_red2` and `change_black2`.
2. `color2` is defined as `max(change_red2, change_black2) - swaps2`.

After executing the line `total2 = swaps2 + color2`, the new value of `swaps2` is calculated as follows:

- `swaps2` becomes `swaps2 + color2`, which simplifies to `min(change_red2, change_black2) + (max(change_red2, change_black2) - min(change_red2, change_black2))`.
- This simplifies further to `max(change_red2, change_black2)`.

Therefore, the value of `swaps2` is now `max(change_red2, change_black2)`.

Output State: **`swaps2` is `max(change_red2, change_black2)`, `change_red2` is unchanged, `change_black2` is unchanged, `color2` is `max(change_red2, change_black2) - swaps2`.**
