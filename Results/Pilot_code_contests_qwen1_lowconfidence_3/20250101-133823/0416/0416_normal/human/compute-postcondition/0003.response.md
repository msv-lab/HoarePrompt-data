The code assigns 0 to the variable `change_black`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `line`, and `change_red`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000; `line` is a string input by the user; `change_red` is 0; `change_black` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000; `line` is a string input by the user; `change_red` is 0; `change_black` is 0**
