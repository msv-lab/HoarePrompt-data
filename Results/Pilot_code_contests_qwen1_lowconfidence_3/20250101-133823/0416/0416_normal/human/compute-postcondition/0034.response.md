Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `line` is a non-empty string.
   - `idx` is either 0 or 1.
   - `val` is the character at index `idx` in `line`.
   - If `idx % 2 == 0` and `val` is 'r', then `change_red2` is increased by 1 and `change_black2` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `change_black2` and `change_red2` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `line` using `enumerate`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `idx` is either 0 or 1.
   - `val` is the character at index `idx` in `line`.

4. **Decision Based on Conditions:**
   - If `idx % 2 == 0` and `val` is 'r', then `change_red2` is increased by 1 and `change_black2` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `change_black2` and `change_red2` remain unchanged.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - If `idx` is 0, the next value of `idx` will be 1.
   - If `idx` is 1, the next value of `idx` will be 2 (but since we only have a non-empty string, this case would mean moving to the next character if it exists).

6. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is about to enter another iteration, `idx` will increase by 1.
   - `val` will be the character at the new `idx`.

Given the above points, let's summarize the state adjustments needed for the next iteration:

- `idx` will be incremented by 1, so if it was 0, it will become 1; if it was 1, it will become 2 (but we assume the string has enough characters).
- `val` will be the character at the new `idx`.

Since `line` is a non-empty string and `idx` is either 0 or 1, after the first iteration, `idx` will become 1 for sure, and `val` will be the character at index 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`line` is a non-empty string, `idx` is 1, `val` is the character at index 1 in `line`.**
