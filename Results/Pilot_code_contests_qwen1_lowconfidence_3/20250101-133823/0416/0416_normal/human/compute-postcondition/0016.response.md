Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000.
   - `line` is a non-empty string.
   - `change_black` is incremented by 1 if the new index `idx` is even and the value `val` is 'b'.
   - `change_black` is incremented by 1 if the new index `idx` is odd and the value `val` is 'r'.
   - `change_red` is incremented by 1 if the new index `idx` is odd and the value `val` is 'r'. Otherwise, `change_red` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `line` using `enumerate`. This means:
   - `idx` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `val` is the character at the current index `idx`.

3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time:
   - The index `idx` must be incremented by 1.
   - The variable `val` must be the next character in the string `line`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since `idx` is incremented by 1, the new `idx` will be the previous `idx` plus 1.
   - The new `val` will be the character at this new index `idx`.
   - The conditions for incrementing `change_black` and `change_red` remain the same based on the new `idx` and `val`.

Given the above steps, the updated states for the next iteration are:

- `n` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `line` remains the same as it is not modified by the loop.
- `change_black` and `change_red` remain unchanged unless the new `idx` and `val` meet the specific conditions.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000; `line` is a non-empty string; `change_black` is incremented by 1 if the new index `idx` (which is the previous `idx` + 1) is even and the value `val` is 'b'; if the new index `idx` is odd and the value `val` is 'r', `change_black` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `change_black` remains unchanged. `change_red` is incremented by 1 if the new index `idx` is odd and the value `val` is 'r'; otherwise, `change_red` remains unchanged.**
