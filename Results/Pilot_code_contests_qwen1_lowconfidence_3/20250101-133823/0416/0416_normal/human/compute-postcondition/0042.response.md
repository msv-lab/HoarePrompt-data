The code `change_red2 += 1` increments the value of `change_red2` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `change_red2` was increased by 1 from its original value, so it is now increased by 2 from its original value.

The initial conditions also include `idx` being 2 and `val` being 'r'. Since `idx % 2 == 0` (because 2 % 2 == 0) and `val` is 'r', the condition `idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'b'` is false, meaning `change_black2` remains in its original state.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `change_red2` is increased by 2 from its original value.
- `change_black2` remains in its original state.

Output State: **`line` is a non-empty string, `idx` is 2, `val` is 'r', `change_red2` is increased by 2 from its original value, and `change_black2` remains in its original state.**
