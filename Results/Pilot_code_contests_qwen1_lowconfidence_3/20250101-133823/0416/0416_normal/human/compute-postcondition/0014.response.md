`change_red` is incremented by 1, meaning it now holds the value of its previous value plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000; `line` is a non-empty string; `change_black` is incremented by 1 if the new index `idx` is even and the value `val` is 'b'; `change_red` is equal to its previous value plus 1.**
