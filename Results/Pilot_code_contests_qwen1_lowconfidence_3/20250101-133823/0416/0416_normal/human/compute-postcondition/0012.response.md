The code `change_black += 1` increments the value of `change_black` by 1. Since `n` and `line` are not affected by this line of code, their values remain unchanged. The initial state is that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `line` is a non-empty string, `change_black` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the new index `idx` is even and the value `val` is 'b', and `change_red` is incremented by 1 if the new index `idx` is odd and the value `val` is 'r'. After executing the code, `change_black` will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000; `line` is a non-empty string; `change_black` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the new index `idx` is even and the value `val` is 'b'; `change_red` is incremented by 1 if the new index `idx` is odd and the value `val` is 'r'.**
