The code `change_black += 1` increments the value of `change_black` by 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `change_black` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000; `line` is a non-empty string; `change_black` is incremented by 1; `change_red` remains unchanged.**
