The code `swaps2 = min(change_red2, change_black2)` assigns the minimum value between `change_red2` and `change_black2` to `swaps2`. However, the initial values of `change_red2` and `change_black2` are not specified. Therefore, we can only state that `swaps2` will hold the smaller of the two values.

Output State: **`swaps2` is the minimum of `change_red2` and `change_black2`, `change_red2` is unchanged, `change_black2` is unchanged.**
