The code `change_red += 1` increments the value of `change_red` by 1. The initial state of `change_red` is dependent on the conditions specified: it is either 0 or 1. Since the code only modifies `change_red`, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of `change_red` is `change_red + 1`.

Given the initial condition where `change_red` is either 0 or 1, after executing the code:

- If `change_red` was 0, it becomes 1.
- If `change_red` was 1, it becomes 2.

However, since we cannot know the exact initial value without additional context, we will represent the updated value in terms of the initial value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `line` is a non-empty string, `change_black` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the current index `idx` is even and the value `val` is 'b', and the current value of `val` is 'r' with `idx` being odd, `change_red` is the initial value of `change_red` + 1**
