Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the code fails to correctly determine the correctness of the text after each command and calculate the minimum number of colors needed for bracket coloring.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Bracket Sequence Validation**: The code does not validate the entire text after each command to ensure it forms a correct bracket sequence. Instead, it only checks if the left and right sums are zero and if the minimum values are non-negative. This approach is insufficient for validating the correctness of the entire sequence.

2. **Handling of Bracket Sequences**: The code does not properly handle nested brackets and consecutive correct texts. For instance, it should recognize that sequences like `(()(()())())(())` require three colors, but the current implementation may fail to accurately determine the number of colors needed for such complex sequences.

3. **Cursor Position Tracking**: While the cursor position is tracked, the logic for updating the `left_sum`, `right_sum`, `left_min`, `right_min`, `left_max`, and `right_max` arrays is overly simplistic and may not capture the complexities of the bracket sequence correctly.

### Example Where the Program Fails:

Consider the input sequence `((a)b)c`. Let's walk through the steps:

1. Initial state: `cursor_pos = 1`
2. Command: `L` -> `cursor_pos = 1`
3. Command: `(` -> `context[1] = 1`
4. Command: `(` -> `context[2] = 1`
5. Command: `L` -> `cursor_pos = 1`
6. Command: `a` -> `context[1] = 1`
7. Command: `)` -> `context[1] = -1` (left sum becomes 0, but right sum is still 1, so it's not valid)

After the above steps, the code would incorrectly append `-1` to `ans_list`, indicating the text is not correct. However, the sequence `((a)b)c` is actually correct, so the output should be `1`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues described, the provided code does not correctly validate the bracket sequences or compute the minimum number of colors required for bracket coloring in every case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
