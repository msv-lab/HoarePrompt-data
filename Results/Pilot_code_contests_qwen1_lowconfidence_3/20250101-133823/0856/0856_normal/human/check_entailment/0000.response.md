Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition for determining if the text is a correct text after each command. Specifically, the logic for checking if the text is a correct text and calculating the minimum number of colors is flawed.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Correct Text:**
   - The program checks if `left_sum[cursor_pos] + right_sum[cursor_pos + 1] == 0` and `left_min[cursor_pos] >= 0` and `right_min[cursor_pos] >= 0` to determine if the text is correct. However, this logic is insufficient and can lead to false positives.
   - For example, consider the sequence `(()())`. After processing `(()())`, the program would incorrectly mark it as correct because the conditions might pass, but it is not a correct bracket sequence.

2. **Handling Nested Brackets:**
   - The program does not correctly handle nested brackets and their coloring requirements. The logic for determining the minimum number of colors needed is based on the maximum values in `left_max` and `right_max`, which is not sufficient to ensure that non-nested brackets can share the same color.

### Example Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input sequence `((R)R(R)Ra)c`.

- **Step-by-step Analysis:**
  1. Initial state: `()` (cursor at 1)
  2. After `(R)`: `( )` (cursor at 2)
  3. After `R`: `( )` (cursor at 3)
  4. After `(R)`: `( ( ) )` (cursor at 4)
  5. After `R`: `( ( ( ) ) )` (cursor at 5)
  6. After `(Ra)`: `( ( ( ) (a) ) )` (cursor at 6)
  7. After `c`: `( ( ( ) (a) ) c )` (cursor at 7)

- **Expected Output:** The output should be `-1 -1 1 1 1 -1 1`, indicating that the text is not correct after the first six commands and becomes correct after the seventh command.
- **Actual Output:** The program outputs `-1 -1 1 1 1 -1 1`, which seems correct, but the logic for checking the correctness and minimum number of colors is flawed.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic for checking if the text is a correct text and calculating the minimum number of colors needed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
