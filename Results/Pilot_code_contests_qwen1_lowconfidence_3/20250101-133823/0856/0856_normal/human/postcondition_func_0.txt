The function processes a string `operations` containing commands 'L' (move left), 'R' (move right), and parentheses '(', ')' which represent numerical values. It calculates and appends to `ans_list` the maximum possible values of the right or left side of the cursor position under specific conditions (i.e., `left_sum[cursor_pos] + right_sum[cursor_pos + 1] == 0` and both `left_min[cursor_pos]` and `right_min[cursor_pos]` are non-negative). After processing all operations, it prints the contents of `ans_list`. The function also maintains several arrays (`left_sum`, `right_sum`, `left_min`, `right_min`, `left_max`, `right_max`, `context`) to keep track of cumulative sums, minimum/maximum values, and current values at each position during the process. If the operations result in invalid conditions, the corresponding `ans` will be -1 and appended to `ans_list`. The function does not handle invalid inputs such as commands other than 'L', 'R', '(', ')', or non-integer values for parentheses. Additionally, the function uses `raw_input()` instead of `input()`, which might lead to a `NameError` in Python 3, as `raw_input()` was renamed to `input()` in Python 3.
