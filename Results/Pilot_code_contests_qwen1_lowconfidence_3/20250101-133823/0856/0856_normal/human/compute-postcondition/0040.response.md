Postcondition: **`ans` is -1, `ans_list` contains -1, and `cursor_pos` is adjusted based on the condition of `op`. If `op == 'L'`, `cursor_pos` is set to `max(1, cursor_pos - 1)`. If `op != 'L'`, `cursor_pos` is incremented by 1 and `context` at position `cursor_pos` is `op_val`, where `op_val` is either the value of `operator_map[op]` or 0 depending on whether `op` is in `operator_map`. Both `ans_list` and `operations` retain their initial states as specified in the precondition.**
