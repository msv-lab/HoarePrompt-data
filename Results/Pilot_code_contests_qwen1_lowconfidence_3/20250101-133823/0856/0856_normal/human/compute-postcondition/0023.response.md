Let's go through this step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `operations` is a string containing at least one character.
   - If the current operation (`op`) is 'L', then `cursor_pos` is 1.
   - Otherwise, `op` is 'R' and `cursor_pos` is increased by 1, or `op` is not 'R' and `op_val` (either the value associated with `op` in `operator_map` or 0) is used to update `context[cursor_pos]`.
   - `left_sum[cursor_pos]` is not defined before this line, implying it might be initialized to 0 or another value.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `left_sum[cursor_pos] = left_sum[cursor_pos - 1] + context[cursor_pos]` is executed.
   - This means that `left_sum[cursor_pos]` gets updated to the sum of `left_sum[cursor_pos - 1]` and `context[cursor_pos]`.

3. **Impact**:
   - The value of `left_sum[cursor_pos]` changes according to the formula provided.
   - The value of `cursor_pos` remains unchanged because the code only updates the value of `left_sum[cursor_pos]` and does not alter `cursor_pos` itself.
   - All other variables remain unaffected by this line of code.

Given the conditions, let's assume the following scenarios:

- **Scenario 1**: If `op` is 'L', then `cursor_pos` is 1. Hence, `left_sum[1]` would be updated to `left_sum[0] + context[1]`.
- **Scenario 2**: If `op` is 'R', then `cursor_pos` is increased by 1. Let's say `cursor_pos` was previously `n`, then after executing this line, `left_sum[n+1]` would be updated to `left_sum[n] + context[n+1]`.
- **Scenario 3**: If `op` is neither 'L' nor 'R', then `cursor_pos` is updated using `op_val`. But since `left_sum[cursor_pos]` depends on `left_sum[cursor_pos - 1]`, and `context[cursor_pos]`, the value of `cursor_pos` is still used in the calculation.

Since `cursor_pos` is not modified, its value stays the same as per the initial conditions. However, the value of `left_sum[cursor_pos]` is updated based on the given formula.

Output State: **`operations` is a string containing at least one character, `cursor_pos` remains as per the initial conditions, `left_sum[cursor_pos]` is updated to `left_sum[cursor_pos - 1] + context[cursor_pos]`.**
