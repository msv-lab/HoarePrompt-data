Postcondition: ***`ans` is -1, `ans_list` contains -1, `cursor_pos` is increased by 1, and `context` at position `cursor_pos` is `op_val`, where `op_val` is either the value of `operator_map[op]` or 0 depending on whether `op` is in `operator_map`. Both `ans_list` and `operations` retain their initial states as specified in the precondition.***
