The code initializes `right_sum` as a list of zeros with a length of `n + 2`. This means that each element in `right_sum` is set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `operations` is a string input from the user.
- `n` is an integer input.
- `ans_list` is an empty list.
- `operator_map` is a dictionary mapping `(` to 1 and `)` to -1.
- `left_sum` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0.
- `right_sum` is now a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0.

Output State: **`operations` is a string input from the user, `n` is an integer input, `ans_list` is an empty list, `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}, `left_sum` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `right_sum` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0.**
