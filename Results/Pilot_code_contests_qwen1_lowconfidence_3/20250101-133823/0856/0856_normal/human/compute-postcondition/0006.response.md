The code initializes `left_min` as a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0. This means that each element in `left_min` is assigned the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`operations` is a string input from the user, `n` is an integer input, `ans_list` is an empty list, `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}, `left_sum` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `right_sum` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `left_min` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0.**
