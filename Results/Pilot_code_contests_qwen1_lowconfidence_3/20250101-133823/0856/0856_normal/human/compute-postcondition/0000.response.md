The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The input string `s` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` and retains the initial state of the input string `s`.

Output State: **The input string `s` is a sequence of valid commands consisting of 'L', 'R', lowercase Latin letters, and brackets '(', ')'; `n` is an integer input**
