The code initializes `right_min` as a list of zeros with a length of `n + 2`. All elements in this list are set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`operations` is a string input from the user, `n` is an integer input, `ans_list` is an empty list, `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}, `left_sum` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `right_sum` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `left_min` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `right_min` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0.**
