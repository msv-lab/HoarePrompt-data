`ans_list` is appended with the current value of `ans`, which is -1, because the condition `left_sum[cursor_pos] + right_sum[cursor_pos + 1] == 0 and left_min[cursor_pos] >= 0 and (right_min[cursor_pos] >= 0)` is not met. The value of `ans` remains -1 and the states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ans` is -1, `ans_list` contains -1**
