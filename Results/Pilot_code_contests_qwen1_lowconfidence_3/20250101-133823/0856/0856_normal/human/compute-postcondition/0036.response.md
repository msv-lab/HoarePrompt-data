The `cursor_pos` variable is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `ans` is -1, `ans_list` contains -1, and `operations` must contain at least one more element. After executing `cursor_pos += 1`, the value of `cursor_pos` is updated, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is -1, `ans_list` contains -1, `operations` must contain at least one more element, `cursor_pos` is increased by 1**
