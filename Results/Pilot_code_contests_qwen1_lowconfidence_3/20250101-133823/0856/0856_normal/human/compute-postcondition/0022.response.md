Postcondition: ***`operations` is a string containing at least one character. If the current operation (`op`) is 'L', then `cursor_pos` is 1. Otherwise, `op` is 'R' and `cursor_pos` is increased by 1, or `op` is not 'R' and `op_val` (either the value associated with `op` in `operator_map` or 0) is used to update `context[cursor_pos]`.***
