The code `op_val = operator_map.get(op, 0)` retrieves the value associated with the key `op` from the dictionary `operator_map`. If `op` is not found in the dictionary, the default value `0` is used. However, since the exact content of `operator_map` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `op_val`. Therefore, the only information that changes is that `op_val` is assigned a value based on `op` and `operator_map`.

Output State: **`ans` is -1, `ans_list` contains -1, `op_val` is either the value of `operator_map[op]` or 0 depending on whether `op` is in `operator_map`, `operations` must contain at least one more element**
