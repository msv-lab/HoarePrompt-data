`cursor_pos` is decremented by 1, but it cannot go below 1. Since the initial value of `cursor_pos` is at least 1 (from the precondition), decrementing it by 1 will result in `cursor_pos` being equal to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`operations` is a string that must contain at least one character, and the current operation (`op`) is 'L'; `cursor_pos` is 1**
