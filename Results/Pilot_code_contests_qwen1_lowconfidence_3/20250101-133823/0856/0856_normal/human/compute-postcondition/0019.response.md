`op_val` is assigned the value returned by `operator_map.get(op, 0)`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `operator_map` or the exact value of `op`, we can only say that `op_val` will be the value associated with `op` in `operator_map` if it exists, otherwise it will be 0.

Output State: **`operations` is a string containing at least one character, and the operation `op` is not 'R'; `op_val` is either the value associated with `op` in `operator_map` or 0.**
