The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `cursor_pos`. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `cursor_pos` and retains the initial values of the other variables.

Output State: **`operations` is a string input from the user, `n` is an integer input, `ans_list` is an empty list, `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}, `left_sum` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `right_sum` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `left_min` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `right_min` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `right_max` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `cursor_pos` is 1.**
