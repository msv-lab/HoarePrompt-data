The code initializes `left_max` as a list of `n + 2` elements, each set to 0. This means `left_max` is now a list of `n + 2` zeros.

Output State: **`operations` is a string input from the user, `n` is an integer input, `ans_list` is an empty list, `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}, `left_sum` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `right_sum` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `left_min` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `right_min` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `left_max` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0.**
