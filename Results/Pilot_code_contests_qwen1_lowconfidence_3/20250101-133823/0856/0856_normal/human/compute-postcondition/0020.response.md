`context[cursor_pos]` is assigned the value `op_val`. The value of `op_val` is either the value associated with `op` in `operator_map` or 0. The initial state does not specify the exact value of `op_val`, but it remains as either the value associated with `op` in `operator_map` or 0. The states of the other variables (`operations`, `cursor_pos`, `op`, `operator_map`) are not affected.

Output State: **`operations` is a string containing at least one character, and the operation `op` is not 'R'; `op_val` is either the value associated with `op` in `operator_map` or 0; context[cursor_pos] is op_val**
