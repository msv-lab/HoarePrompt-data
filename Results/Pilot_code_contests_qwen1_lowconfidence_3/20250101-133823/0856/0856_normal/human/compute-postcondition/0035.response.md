`cursor_pos` is assigned the value of `max(1, cursor_pos - 1)`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `cursor_pos`, we know that `cursor_pos` is adjusted to be at least 1 but could be reduced by 1 from its original value. The conditions for `cursor_pos` being at least 1 are preserved. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is -1, `ans_list` contains -1, `operations` must contain at least one more element, `cursor_pos` is adjusted to be `max(1, cursor_pos - 1)`.

Output State: **`ans` is -1, `ans_list` contains -1, `operations` must contain at least one more element, `cursor_pos` is adjusted to be `max(1, cursor_pos - 1)`**
