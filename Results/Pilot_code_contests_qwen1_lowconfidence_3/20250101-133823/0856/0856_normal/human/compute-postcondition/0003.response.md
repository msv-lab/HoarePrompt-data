The code defines a dictionary `operator_map` which maps parentheses to their corresponding values (`'('` to 1 and `')'` to -1). This does not perform any operations on the variables `operations`, `n`, or `ans_list`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`operations` is a string input from the user, `n` is an integer input, `ans_list` is an empty list, `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}**
