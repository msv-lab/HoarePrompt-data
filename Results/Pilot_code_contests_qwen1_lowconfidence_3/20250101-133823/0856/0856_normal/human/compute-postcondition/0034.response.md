According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `op` from the list `operations`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `operations`.

At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is -1, and `ans_list` contains -1. This means that the loop body has been executed at least once, and the operation `op` was processed, but it did not change the value of `ans` or `ans_list`.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `operations` that has not been processed yet.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `ans` remains -1 (since the loop body has not changed its value) and `ans_list` still contains -1. Additionally, `operations` must contain at least one more element.

State: **`ans` is -1, `ans_list` contains -1, `operations` must contain at least one more element**
