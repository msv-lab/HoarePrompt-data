The code initializes `right_max` as a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0. This overrides the initial state of `right_sum` and `right_min`, which were also lists of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0. However, since `right_max` is now set to a list of zeros, we will use this new value for `right_max`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`operations` is a string input from the user, `n` is an integer input, `ans_list` is an empty list, `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}, `left_sum` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `right_sum` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `left_min` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `right_min` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `right_max` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0.**
