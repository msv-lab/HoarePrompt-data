The code initializes `context` as a list containing `(0)` repeated `n + 2` times. The value of each element in the `context` list is `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`operations` is a string input from the user, `n` is an integer input, `ans_list` is an empty list, `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}, `left_sum` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `right_sum` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `left_min` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `right_min` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `right_max` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `cursor_pos` is 1, `context` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0.**
