ind is an integer such that 1 <= ind <= len(tree), where tree is a list representing a binary heap (with indices adjusted for zero-based indexing) containing integers. Each index in the tree corresponds to a friend's relation value (frendly[frendly.index(tree[ind])] gives the relation value of the friend represented by the current index).
