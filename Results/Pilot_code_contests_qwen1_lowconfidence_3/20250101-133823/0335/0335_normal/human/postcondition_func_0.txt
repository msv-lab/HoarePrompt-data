The function processes an n Ã— m 2D list (matrix) where each element is a lowercase Latin letter. It iterates through each character in the matrix and appends it to the `selected_words` string if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`. After processing all characters, it prints the `selected_words` string. If `func_2(matrix, i, j)` is not defined or does not return a boolean value for any element, it will still iterate through the entire matrix and concatenate all characters into `selected_words`. Potential edge cases include when the matrix is empty (i.e., n or m is zero), which would result in an empty `selected_words` string. Additionally, if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` is undefined or does not exist, the function will still execute without error, but the behavior regarding which characters are appended to `selected_words` might not be as intended.
