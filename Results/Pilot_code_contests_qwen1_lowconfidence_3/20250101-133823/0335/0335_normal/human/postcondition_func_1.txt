The function `func_2` takes a 2D list `matrix` and two non-negative integers `i` and `j` as input. It checks if the character at `matrix[i][j]` appears either in the same row (excluding the character itself) or in the same column (excluding the character itself). If the character meets this condition, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. After performing the check, the original character at `matrix[i][j]` is restored.
