You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An African crossword is a rectangular table n × m in size. Each cell of the table contains exactly one letter. This table (it is also referred to as grid) contains some encrypted word that needs to be decoded.

To solve the crossword you should cross out all repeated letters in rows and columns. In other words, a letter should only be crossed out if and only if the corresponding column or row contains at least one more letter that is exactly the same. Besides, all such letters are crossed out simultaneously.

When all repeated letters have been crossed out, we should write the remaining letters in a string. The letters that occupy a higher position follow before the letters that occupy a lower position. If the letters are located in one row, then the letter to the left goes first. The resulting word is the answer to the problem.

You are suggested to solve an African crossword and print the word encrypted there.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). Next n lines contain m lowercase Latin letters each. That is the crossword grid.

Output

Print the encrypted word on a single line. It is guaranteed that the answer consists of at least one letter.

Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, m) = list(map(int, raw_input('').split()))
    matrix = []
    selected_words = ''
    for i in range(n):
        letters = raw_input('')
        row = []
        for letter in letters:
            row.append(letter)
        matrix.append(row)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if not func_2(matrix, i, j):
                selected_words += matrix[i][j]
    print(selected_words)

#Function 2:
def func_2(matrix, i, j):
    letter = matrix[i][j]
    matrix[i][j] = '_'
    result = letter in matrix[i] or letter in zip(*matrix)[j]
    matrix[i][j] = letter
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical issue with how it checks for repeated letters in rows and columns. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not correctly update the matrix to prevent rechecking of already processed cells. Here’s a counterexample to illustrate the problem:

Consider the following input:
```
3 3
aab
abb
bba
```

Expected output:
```
ab
```

However, the current implementation will produce:
```
aabb
```

This happens because the function `func_2` does not properly mark cells as visited to avoid double-counting. When checking the second 'b' in the third row, it incorrectly marks it as a repeated letter since the first 'b' in the same column is still marked.

To fix this, you need to ensure that once a cell is marked for removal, it is not re-evaluated. One way to do this is to keep track of which cells have been processed and avoid re-checking them.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    matrix = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    selected_words = []

    # Mark processed cells
    processed = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if not processed[i][j]:
                if func_2(matrix, i, j, processed):
                    selected_words.append(matrix[i][j])

    print(''.join(selected_words))

def func_2(matrix, i, j, processed):
    letter = matrix[i][j]
    result = letter in matrix[i] or letter in zip(*matrix)[j]

    # Mark the cell as processed
    processed[i][j] = True

    return result

# Reading input
func_1()
```

With this correction, the program will correctly identify and remove repeated letters while ensuring that each cell is only processed once.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, and matrix is an n × m 2D list where each element is a lowercase Latin letter.
def func_1():
    n, m = list(map(int, raw_input('').split()))
    matrix = []
    selected_words = ''
    for i in range(n):
        letters = raw_input('')
        
        row = []
        
        for letter in letters:
            row.append(letter)
        
        matrix.append(row)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row, `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is an empty string.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if not func_2(matrix, i, j):
                selected_words += matrix[i][j]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0 and at least 1), `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`.
    print(selected_words)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an n × m 2D list (matrix) where each element is a lowercase Latin letter. It iterates through each character in the matrix and appends it to the `selected_words` string if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`. After processing all characters, it prints the `selected_words` string. If `func_2(matrix, i, j)` is not defined or does not return a boolean value for any element, it will still iterate through the entire matrix and concatenate all characters into `selected_words`. Potential edge cases include when the matrix is empty (i.e., n or m is zero), which would result in an empty `selected_words` string. Additionally, if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` is undefined or does not exist, the function will still execute without error, but the behavior regarding which characters are appended to `selected_words` might not be as intended.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a 2D list of characters representing the crossword grid, i and j are non-negative integers such that 0 <= i < len(matrix) and 0 <= j < len(matrix[0]), and letter is a character stored in matrix[i][j].
def func_2(matrix, i, j):
    letter = matrix[i][j]
    matrix[i][j] = '_'
    result = letter in matrix[i] or letter in zip(*matrix)[j]
    matrix[i][j] = letter
    return result
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a 2D list `matrix` and two non-negative integers `i` and `j` as input. It checks if the character at `matrix[i][j]` appears either in the same row (excluding the character itself) or in the same column (excluding the character itself). If the character meets this condition, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. After performing the check, the original character at `matrix[i][j]` is restored.
