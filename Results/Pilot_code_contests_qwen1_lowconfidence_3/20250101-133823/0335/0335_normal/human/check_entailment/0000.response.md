Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where a letter appears multiple times in the same row but not in the same column. For example, consider the following input:

```
4 4
aabb
bacc
ddbb
cccd
```

The expected output should be `abcdbc`, but the program will output `abbc`. 

In the first row, both 'a' and 'b' appear twice but are not in the same column, so they should not be crossed out. However, the current implementation of `func_2` marks them for deletion because it checks for the presence of the letter in either the row or the column, which leads to incorrect deletion.

To fix this, the function `func_2` should check for the presence of the letter in the entire column and row, ensuring that a letter is only deleted if it appears more than once in the same row or column. Here's a corrected version of `func_2`:

```python
def func_2(matrix, i, j):
    letter = matrix[i][j]
    # Check if the letter appears more than once in the row or column
    row_duplicates = matrix[i].count(letter) > 1
    col_duplicates = sum(row[j] == letter for row in matrix) > 1
    return not (row_duplicates or col_duplicates)
```

This corrected function ensures that only letters appearing more than once in the same row or column are kept, while others are crossed out.
