Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic to cross out all repeated letters in rows and columns. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not properly account for repeated letters in both the row and column simultaneously during a single iteration. As a result, it may incorrectly mark a letter as removable even if there is no other identical letter in the same row or column at the time of checking.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
aba
bcb
bab
```

The expected output is "abc" because:
- 'a' in the first row is removed because there is another 'a' in the same row.
- 'b' in the first column is removed because there is another 'b' in the same column.
- 'c' remains because there are no duplicates in its row or column.

However, the current implementation would not remove the 'a' and 'b' as described above, leading to an incorrect output. The function `func_2` only checks for duplicates in the row or column but does not ensure that both conditions are met simultaneously for each character.
