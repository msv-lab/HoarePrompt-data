Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_2` currently does not correctly handle cases where a letter appears multiple times in the same row but not in the same column. Specifically, the current implementation of `func_2` marks a letter for deletion if it appears more than once in either the row or the column, which can lead to incorrect results as demonstrated in the example provided.

The corrected version of `func_2` provided in the annotations ensures that a letter is only deleted if it appears more than once in the same row or column. Since the original code does not implement this correction, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and thus remains incorrect.
