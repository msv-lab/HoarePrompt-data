Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the crossword grid and then reads each row of the grid.
   - This is done using `raw_input` for both the dimensions and the grid, which is appropriate given the constraints \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \).

2. **Matrix Representation:**
   - The grid is stored in a 2D list named `matrix`, where each element is a list of characters.
   - This representation is correct and allows for efficient row and column operations.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` checks whether a letter at position `(i, j)` should be crossed out.
   - It checks if the letter appears again in the same row or column.
   - The function correctly modifies the matrix temporarily to avoid issues with repeated checks.
   - It returns `True` if the letter should be crossed out and `False` otherwise.

4. **Filtering Letters:**
   - The main loop iterates over each cell in the matrix.
   - For each cell, it calls `func_2` to determine if the letter should be included in the final output.
   - Only letters that are not crossed out (i.e., `func_2` returns `False`) are added to `selected_words`.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the concatenated string of remaining letters, which forms the decrypted word.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to remove repeated letters from the rows and columns, ensuring that only unique letters remain in the final output. The use of `func_2` to check for duplicates and the construction of `selected_words` ensures that the program adheres to the problem description in all cases, making the program **correct**.
