Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code still has an issue with the logic in `func_2`. The output hints confirm that `func_2` checks if a character appears in the same row or column excluding itself, but this approach is still flawed. Specifically, it does not ensure that a character is only kept if it appears more than once in the same row or column, leading to incorrect results. The corrected version of `func_2` should check for duplicates correctly, and the original implementation fails to do so. Therefore, the program still does not meet the problem description, and the original assessment remains correct.
