Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code still has issues with marking processed cells, which can lead to incorrect results. The output hints confirm that `func_2` correctly checks for repeated letters, but they do not address the fact that the main logic in `func_1` does not properly handle processed cells. Without marking cells as processed, the program will continue to check already evaluated cells, leading to incorrect results. The corrected version provided in the analysis ensures that each cell is only processed once, which is crucial for the correct functioning of the program. Therefore, the original assessment remains valid.
