Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to cross out all repeated letters in rows and columns simultaneously. The function `func_2` checks if a letter is repeated in its row or column, but it does not ensure that all such letters are crossed out at the same time. Instead, it only checks the presence of the letter and does not modify the matrix to reflect the crossing out process. As a result, the function `func_1` concatenates all characters into `selected_words` without ensuring that only unique letters after removal of repetitions are included.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
aab
aac
aab
```

The expected output should be "abc" because 'a' and 'b' are repeated and should be crossed out, leaving only 'c'. However, the current implementation will output "aaabc", which is incorrect.
