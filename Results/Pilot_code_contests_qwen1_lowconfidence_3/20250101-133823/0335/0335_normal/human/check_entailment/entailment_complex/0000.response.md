Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
- The code follows the problem description accurately. It correctly processes an n Ã— m 2D list where each element is a lowercase Latin letter.
- The `func_2` function checks if a character at a specific position in the matrix appears in the same row or column (excluding the character itself). This ensures that only repeated characters are crossed out.
- The main function iterates through each character in the matrix and appends it to `selected_words` if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, meaning the character is unique in its row and column.
- The code handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description, including when the matrix is empty (which would result in an empty `selected_words` string).
- The annotations correctly summarize the state of the program and the behavior of the functions, matching the problem description and the actual implementation.
- There are no examples or cases provided in the problem description or the annotations that indicate the code does not meet the requirements.

Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case as described in the problem statement.
