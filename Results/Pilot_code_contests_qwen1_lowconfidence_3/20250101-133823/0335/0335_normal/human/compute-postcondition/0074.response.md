The code prints the value of `selected_words`. The value of `selected_words` is determined by the function `func_2(matrix, i, j)`, which returns `False` for certain elements in the matrix. Since the code only prints `selected_words` and does not modify its value, the output will simply be the current value of `selected_words`.

Output State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0 and at least 1), `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, and `selected_words` is printed.**
