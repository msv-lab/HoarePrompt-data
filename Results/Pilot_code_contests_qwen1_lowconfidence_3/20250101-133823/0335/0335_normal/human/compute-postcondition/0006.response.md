Functionality: **The function `func_2` takes a 2D list `matrix` and two non-negative integers `i` and `j` as input. It checks if the character at `matrix[i][j]` appears either in the same row (excluding the character itself) or in the same column (excluding the character itself). If the character meets this condition, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. After performing the check, the original character at `matrix[i][j]` is restored.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `i` or `j` are out of bounds (i.e., `i >= len(matrix)` or `j >= len(matrix[0])`), the function should handle these cases appropriately, possibly raising an exception or returning `False`.
- The function currently does not handle the case where the matrix is empty (`matrix == []`). In such a case, the function would raise an index error.
- The function does not explicitly check if `matrix[i]` or `zip(*matrix)[j]` are empty, which could lead to unexpected behavior if they are.
