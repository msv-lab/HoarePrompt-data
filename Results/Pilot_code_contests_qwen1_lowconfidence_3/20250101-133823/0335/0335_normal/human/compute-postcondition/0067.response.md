`selected_words` is concatenated with the character at `matrix[i][j]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is 2. Therefore, `selected_words` is concatenated with `matrix[1][2]`.

Output State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0 and at least 1), `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the last row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, `i` is 1, and `j` is 2; `selected_words` is updated to include `matrix[1][2]`**
