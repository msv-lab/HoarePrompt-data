Postcondition: ***`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row, `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `selected_words` is either `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][2]` or `matrix[0][2]` depending on whether `func_2(matrix, i, j)` is false or true, respectively.***
