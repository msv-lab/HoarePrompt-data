To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given conditions and requirements:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is the number of rows in the matrix.
   - `m` is the length of each row.
   - `matrix` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters.
   - `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the first row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `j` is `m-1`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `range(m)`, meaning `j` will take values from `0` to `m-1`.

3. **Execution Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must be within the range `0` to `m-1`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - We need to ensure that `j` starts within the valid range and that the loop body can proceed as intended.

Given that `j` is initially set to `m-1`, we need to confirm that `m-1` is within the valid range `[0, m-1]`.

- Since `j` is already set to `m-1`, it is within the valid range.
- No adjustment is needed for `j` because it is already initialized to a valid starting point.

However, we should ensure that the loop can continue to iterate properly. This means we need to confirm that there are more iterations left after the initial one. Given that the loop will start at `j = m-1` and go down to `0`, we need to confirm that `m > 0` to ensure there are iterations.

5. **Final State After Adjustment**:
   - `j` is `m-1`.
   - `m` must be greater than 0 to ensure there are iterations in the loop.

Therefore, the final state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0), `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the first row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, `i` is `n-1`, and `j` is `m-1`**.
