Postcondition: ***`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0), `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the first row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`. If `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, `selected_words` is updated to include the character at `matrix[n-1][m-1]`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
