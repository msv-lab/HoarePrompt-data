`row` appends the `letter` to itself. Since `letter` is one additional character from `letters`, and `letters` is a non-empty string with one fewer character than `row`, appending `letter` to `row` means `row` now contains all characters of `letters` plus one more character. The state of `letters` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`letters` is a non-empty string with one fewer character; `row` contains all characters of `letters` plus one additional character**
