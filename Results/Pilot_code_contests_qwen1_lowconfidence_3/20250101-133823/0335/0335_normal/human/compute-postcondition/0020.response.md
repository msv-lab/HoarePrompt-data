The code appends the `letter` to the `row`. This means the last element in the `row` list is updated to the current value of `letter`. The `matrix` and `i` variables are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `letters` is a non-empty string
- `row` is a list containing the next letter from `letters`
- `matrix` is `[row]` plus the previous row
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 0

After executing `row.append(letter)`, the new state is:
- `row` now contains the next letter from `letters` appended to its previous content
- `matrix` remains unchanged
- `i` remains 1
- `n` remains greater than 0

Output State: **`letters` is a non-empty string, `row` is the list containing the next letter from `letters` with the latest letter appended, `matrix` is `[row]` plus the previous row, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
