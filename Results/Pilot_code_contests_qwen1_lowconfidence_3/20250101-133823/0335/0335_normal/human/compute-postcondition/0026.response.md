The code `letters = raw_input('')` assigns the value entered by the user through the input prompt to the variable `letters`. The previous values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`letters` is a string entered by the user, `row` remains the same, `matrix` remains the same, `i` becomes `len(letters) + 1`, `n` must still be greater than or equal to the length of `letters`.**
