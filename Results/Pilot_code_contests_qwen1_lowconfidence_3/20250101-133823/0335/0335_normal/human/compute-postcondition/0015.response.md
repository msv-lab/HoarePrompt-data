`letters` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user using `raw_input()`. The other variables (`row`, `matrix`, `i`, and `n`) are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`letters` is the input string from the user, `row` contains all characters of the original `letters`, `matrix` is `[row]`, `i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`**
