Output State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row, `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is an empty string.** 

Explanation:
- The outer loop runs `n` times, creating `n` rows in the matrix.
- Each inner loop processes a row of input characters, adding each character to a row list.
- After `n` iterations of the outer loop, there will be `n` rows in the matrix, each containing `m` characters (where `m` is the length of each row of input).

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0), then:
- `n` is 0.
- `matrix` remains an empty list.
- `m` can be any value within its specified range (1 to 100), but since no rows are added, this value doesn't affect the matrix.
- `selected_words` remains an empty string.
