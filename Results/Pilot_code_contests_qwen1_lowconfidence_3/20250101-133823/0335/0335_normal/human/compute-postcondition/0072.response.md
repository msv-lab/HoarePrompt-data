Output State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0 and at least 1), `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the last row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, and `j` is `m - 1`. If `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False for any `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`, `selected_words` is updated to include the character at position `[i][j]`. Otherwise, `selected_words` remains the concatenation of all characters in the last row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False.**

### Explanation:
- **Matrix and Selected Words:** The matrix remains unchanged because the loop only updates the `selected_words` based on the condition in `func_2(matrix, i, j)`. The matrix itself does not change during the loop.
- **i and j:** The loop runs for each column `j` in the matrix. The final value of `j` is `m - 1`, meaning the loop has checked all columns up to the last one.
- **Condition Check:** The loop checks `func_2(matrix, i, j)` for each column `j`. If `func_2` returns `False`, the corresponding character in the last row is added to `selected_words`. If `func_2` returns `True` for all `j`, `selected_words` remains unchanged as it was initialized.

This state reflects the complete execution of the loop, ensuring all relevant conditions are met and all possible updates to `selected_words` are considered.
