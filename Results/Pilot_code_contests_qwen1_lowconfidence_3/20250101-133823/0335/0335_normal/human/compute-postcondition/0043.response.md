The code `selected_words += matrix[i][j]` appends the character at `matrix[i][j]` to the `selected_words` string. Given the initial state:

- `n` is the number of rows in the matrix
- `m` is the length of each row
- `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters
- `selected_words` is `matrix[0][0]`
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 1

The value of `selected_words` is initially `matrix[0][0]`. After executing the line of code, `selected_words` becomes `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][1]` (since `i` is 0 and `j` is 1).

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row, `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][1]`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
