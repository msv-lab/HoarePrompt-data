The code appends the character at position `[i][j]` of the matrix to the `selected_words` string. Given the initial state:

- `n` is the number of rows in the matrix
- `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0)
- `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters
- `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the first row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False
- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` is `0`

The line `selected_words += matrix[i][j]` will add the character at position `[n-1][0]` of the matrix to `selected_words`.

Therefore, the updated value of `selected_words` will be the concatenation of the original `selected_words` and the character at position `[n-1][0]` of the matrix.

Output State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0), `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the first row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `0`, `selected_words` is the concatenation of the original `selected_words` and the character at position `[n-1][0]` of the matrix**
