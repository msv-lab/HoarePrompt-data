The code `row.append(letter)` appends the variable `letter` to the list `row`. Since `letter` is part of the non-empty string `letters`, it will be appended to `row`. The length of `row` increases by one, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`letters` is a non-empty string, `row` is a list containing one element which is `letter` from `letters`, `matrix` is `[row]`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
