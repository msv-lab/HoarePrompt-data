`selected_words` is assigned the value of `selected_words` concatenated with `matrix[i][j]`. Given the initial state, `selected_words` is an empty string (`""`), `i` is 0, and `j` is 0. So, `selected_words` becomes `matrix[0][0]`.

The values of `n`, `m`, `matrix`, `i`, `j`, and the condition of the function `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returning False remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row, `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is now `matrix[0][0]`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the function `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False**
