The code updates the value of `matrix[i][j]` to `'_'`. This means the character stored at position `(i, j)` in the `matrix` is changed to an underscore.

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list of characters representing the crossword grid, `i` and `j` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= i < len(matrix) and 0 <= j < len(matrix[0]), and `letter` is equal to the character stored in `matrix[i][j]` which is now `'_'`.**
