Postcondition: ***`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0 and at least 1), `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the last row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1. If `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, `selected_words` is updated to include the character at `matrix[1][1]`. Otherwise, `selected_words` remains unchanged.***
