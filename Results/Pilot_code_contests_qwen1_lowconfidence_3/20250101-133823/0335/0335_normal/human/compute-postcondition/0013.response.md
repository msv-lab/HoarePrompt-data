The code `matrix.append(row)` appends the `row` to the list `matrix`. Initially, `letters` is an empty string, and `row` contains all characters of the original `letters`. After appending `row` to `matrix`, `matrix` will contain `row` as its first (and only) element. The values of `letters` and `row` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`letters` is an empty string, `row` contains all characters of the original `letters`, `matrix` is `[row]`**
