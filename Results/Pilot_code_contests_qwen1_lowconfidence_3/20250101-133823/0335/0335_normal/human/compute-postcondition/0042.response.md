Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is the number of rows in the matrix.
   - `m` is the length of each row.
   - `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters.
   - `selected_words` is now `matrix[0][0]`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - The function `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-1`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0.
   - Since `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returned False, it means the loop condition for continuing the iteration based on the function's return value is not satisfied. However, the loop itself continues as long as `j` is within the range `[0, m-1]`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become `1`.

5. **Adjusted States**:
   - `n` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `m` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `matrix` remains the same as it is not modified by the loop.
   - `selected_words` remains the same as it is not modified by the loop.
   - `i` remains 0 as the loop only increments `j`.
   - `j` becomes 1.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row, `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is now `matrix[0][0]`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**.
