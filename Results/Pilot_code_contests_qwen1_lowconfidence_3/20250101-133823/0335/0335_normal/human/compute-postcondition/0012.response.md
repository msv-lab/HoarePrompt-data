Output State: **`letters` is an empty string, `row` contains all characters of the original `letters`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to append each character from `letters` into `row`.
- If `letters` is an empty string initially, the loop will not execute at all. Therefore, `row` will remain an empty list.
- If `letters` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute until all characters are appended to `row`.

Since the loop appends each character of `letters` to `row`, once the loop finishes, `row` will contain all characters of the original `letters` string, and `letters` itself will be an empty string if it was originally non-empty.
