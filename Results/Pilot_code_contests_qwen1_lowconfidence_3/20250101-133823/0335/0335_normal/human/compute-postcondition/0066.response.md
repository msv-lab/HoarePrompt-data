Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is the number of rows in the matrix.
   - `m` is the length of each row, and it must be greater than 0 and at least 1.
   - `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters.
   - `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the last row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 1.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `i` remains 1 because the loop is iterating over `j`.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since `j` is being incremented from 1 to 2, the new value of `j` will be 2.
   - The values of `n`, `m`, `matrix`, `selected_words`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop incrementing `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0 and at least 1), `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the last row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, `i` is 1, and `j` is 2**.
