The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `matrix`, `i`, and `j`. `matrix` is a 2D list of characters representing the crossword grid, `i` and `j` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq i < \text{len(matrix)}\) and \(0 \leq j < \text{len(matrix[0])}\), and the function checks if the element at `matrix[i][j]` is a specific character (though the character itself is not provided in the problem statement). The return value of the function is True.

Functionality: **The function accepts a 2D list `matrix`, and two non-negative integers `i` and `j`. It returns `True` if the character at `matrix[i][j]` meets a certain condition (though the specific condition is not detailed here).**
