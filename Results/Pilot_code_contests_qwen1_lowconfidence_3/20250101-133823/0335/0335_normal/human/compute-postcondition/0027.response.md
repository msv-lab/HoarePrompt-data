The code `row = []` creates an empty list and assigns it to the variable `row`. This operation does not affect the values of `letters`, `matrix`, `i`, or `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `letters` is a string entered by the user, `row` is an empty list, `matrix` remains the same, `i` becomes `len(letters) + 1`, `n` must still be greater than or equal to the length of `letters`.

Output State: **`letters` is a string entered by the user, `row` is an empty list, `matrix` remains the same, `i` becomes `len(letters) + 1`, `n` must still be greater than or equal to the length of `letters`.**
