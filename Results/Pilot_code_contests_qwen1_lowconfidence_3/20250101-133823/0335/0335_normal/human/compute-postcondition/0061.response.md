Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop step by step:

### Given Program State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is the number of rows in the matrix.
- `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0).
- `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters.
- `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the last row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. The loop iterates over each row in the matrix, starting from `i = 0` up to `i = n-1`.
2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`.

### Current State:
- `i` is currently 0, which means we are at the beginning of the first row of the matrix.
- The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- Since the loop iterates over each row, the new value of `i` should be checked against `n`.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` will become 1.
- `j` will reset to 0 since the loop restarts from the beginning of the new row.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `matrix` remains unchanged.
- `selected_words` remains unchanged because it is derived from the last row, and the current row is still being processed.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, the state should reflect that `i` has been incremented by 1, while `j` resets to 0.

### State:
**`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0), `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the last row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, `i` is 1, and `j` is 0.**
