`row` is appended with the value of `letter`. The value of `letter` is a character from the non-empty string `letters`. However, the exact character appended to `row` is not specified in the code. Therefore, we can say that `row` has been modified by adding one more element (a character) to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`letters` is a non-empty string, `row` contains one additional character from `letters`**
