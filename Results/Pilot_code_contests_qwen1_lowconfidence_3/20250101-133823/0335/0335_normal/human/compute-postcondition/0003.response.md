The code `matrix[i][j] = letter` changes the value at `matrix[i][j]` from `'_'` to the character stored in the variable `letter`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `matrix` is a 2D list of characters representing the crossword grid,
- `i` and `j` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq i < \text{len(matrix)}\) and \(0 \leq j < \text{len(matrix[0])}\),
- `letter` is equal to the character stored in `matrix[i][j]` which is now `'_'`,
- `result` is `True`.

After executing the code, the value of `matrix[i][j]` is updated to `letter`.

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list of characters representing the crossword grid, `i` and `j` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq i < \text{len(matrix)}\) and \(0 \leq j < \text{len(matrix[0])}\), `letter` is equal to the character stored in `matrix[i][j]` which is now not `'_'`, and `result` is `True`.**
