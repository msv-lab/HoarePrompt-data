`matrix` is a list that now includes the `row` list, which contains all characters of `letters`. The value of `n` remains unchanged because the code only appends `row` to `matrix`. The length of `letters` does not affect the value of `n` directly, but it is mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`letters` is a non-empty string, `n` is greater than or equal to the length of `letters`, `row` is a list containing all characters of `letters`, `matrix` is a list containing the `row` list.**
