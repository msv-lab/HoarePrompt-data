According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `m-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `0`, and `i` is `n-1`.

To determine the new state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

1. The value of `j` must be incremented by 1.
2. The loop should continue as long as `j` is less than `m`.

Given that `j` is currently `0`, it needs to become `1` for the loop to execute again. Since `m` must be greater than `0`, this condition is already satisfied.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:

- `i` remains `n-1`.
- `j` increases to `1`.
- `n` and `m` remain the same.
- `matrix` remains the same.
- `selected_words` remains the same unless `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, but since the problem does not specify an update in this case, it remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0), `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of the original `selected_words` and the character at position `[n-1][0]` of the matrix, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `1`**.
