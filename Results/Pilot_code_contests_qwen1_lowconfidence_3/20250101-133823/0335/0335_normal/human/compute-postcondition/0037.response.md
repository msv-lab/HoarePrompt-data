State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row, `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is an empty string, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0**

### Explanation:
1. **Variables to Adjust**:
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 as per the `range(n)` function.
   - The condition for the loop to execute is that `n` (the number of rows) must be greater than 0.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is the number of rows in the matrix.
   - `m` is the length of each row.
   - `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters.
   - `selected_words` is an empty string.

3. **Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to start, `n` must be greater than 0 because `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `i` should be initialized to 0 to match the starting point of the loop.

By ensuring these adjustments, the loop can correctly iterate over the rows of the matrix.
