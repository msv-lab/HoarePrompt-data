Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `n` is the number of rows in the matrix.
   - `m` is the length of each row.
   - `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters.
   - `selected_words` is either `matrix[0][0]` (if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` is true) or `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][1]` (if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` is false).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 1.

2. **Loop Execution**: The loop is defined as:
   ```
   for j in range(m):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 1.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be 2.
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0.
   - The values of `n`, `m`, `matrix`, and `selected_words` remain unchanged because the loop body does not modify these variables directly based on the given information.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row, `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is either `matrix[0][0]` (if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` is true) or `matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][1]` (if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` is false), `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
