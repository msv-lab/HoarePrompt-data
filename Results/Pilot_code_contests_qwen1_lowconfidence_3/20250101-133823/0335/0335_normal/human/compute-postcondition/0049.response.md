According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the number of rows in the matrix.
- `m` is the length of each row.
- `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters.
- `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the first row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `j` is `m-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently `n-1`, it cannot be less than `n`. Therefore, the loop will not execute again.

However, we need to update the state based on the current values and ensure that the conditions for the next iteration are clearly stated.

State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row, `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the first row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, `i` is `n-1`, and `j` is `m-1`**. 

Since `i` is already `n-1`, the loop will not execute again.
