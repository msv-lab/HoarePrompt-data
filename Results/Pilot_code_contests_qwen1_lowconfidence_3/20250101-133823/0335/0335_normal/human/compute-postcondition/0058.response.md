The code appends the character at position `[n-1][0]` of the matrix to `selected_words`. 

- `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are the number of rows and the length of each row respectively.
- `matrix` remains unchanged as it is the list of lists containing characters.
- `selected_words` gets updated by adding the character at position `[n-1][0]` to it.
- `i` is decremented by 1, becoming `n-2`.
- `j` remains unchanged as it is set to `1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0), `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of the original `selected_words` and the character at position `[n-1][0]` of the matrix, `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `1`**
