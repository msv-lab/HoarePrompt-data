The code snippet `selected_words += matrix[i][j]` increments `selected_words` by the value of `matrix[i][j]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1, and `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, which means the condition for entering the if statement is satisfied, leading to the increment of `selected_words`.

The initial state of `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the last row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, and this is the first addition, `selected_words` will now include the character at `matrix[1][1]`.

Therefore, the updated state of `selected_words` is the previous value plus the character at `matrix[1][1]`.

Output State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0 and at least 1), `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the last row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False plus the character at `matrix[1][1]`, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1.**
