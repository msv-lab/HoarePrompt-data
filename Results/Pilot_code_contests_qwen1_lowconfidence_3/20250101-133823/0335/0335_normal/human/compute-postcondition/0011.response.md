`row` appends the value of `letter` to itself. The initial state is that `letters` is a non-empty string with one more character, and `row` contains all characters of `letters` plus one additional character. After appending `letter` to `row`, `row` will now contain all characters of `letters` plus two additional characters.

Output State: **`letters` is a non-empty string with one more character; `row` contains all characters of `letters` plus two additional characters**
