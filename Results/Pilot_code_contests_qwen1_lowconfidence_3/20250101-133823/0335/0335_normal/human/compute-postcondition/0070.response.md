`selected_words` is assigned the value of `selected_words + matrix[i][j]`. This means that the character at position `[i][j]` in the matrix is appended to `selected_words`. The values of `n`, `m`, `matrix`, `i`, `j_end`, and `j` are unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0 and at least 1), `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the last row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False plus the character at position `[i][j]`, and `j` is `j_end + 1` where `j_end` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration.**
