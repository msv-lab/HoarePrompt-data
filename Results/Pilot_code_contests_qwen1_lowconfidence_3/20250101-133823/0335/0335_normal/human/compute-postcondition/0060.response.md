Output State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0), `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the last row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Values**: 
   - `n`: Number of rows in the matrix.
   - `m`: Length of each row.
   - `matrix`: A list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters.
   - `selected_words`: The concatenation of all characters in the first row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False.
   - `i`: `n-1`.
   - `j`: `m-1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `j = m-1` to `j = 0` in reverse order.
   - For each iteration, if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, the character at `matrix[i][j]` is appended to `selected_words`.
   - After the loop completes, `i` becomes 0 and `j` becomes 0 because the loop decrements `j` until it reaches 0.

3. **Final State**:
   - The loop will continue to check and concatenate characters in the last row (`i = 0`) from the end (`j = m-1`) to the beginning (`j = 0`).
   - Once the loop completes, `i` will be 0 (pointing to the first row), and `j` will be 0 (pointing to the first character in the first row).

4. **Concatenation**:
   - Since the loop concatenates characters in the last row (`i = n-1`), and considering the loop's final state where `i` is 0 and `j` is 0, the `selected_words` will contain all characters in the last row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False.

5. **Final Values**:
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `m` remains the same.
   - `matrix` remains the same.
   - `selected_words` contains the concatenated characters in the last row where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 0.
