Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `letters` is a non-empty string.
   - `row` is a list containing all the letters from `letters`.
   - `matrix` is a list of lists where each sublist contains a single character from `letters` in order plus an additional sublist which is `row`.
   - `i` is equal to the length of `letters`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to the length of `letters`.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning `i` will take values from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - Since `i` is currently equal to the length of `letters`, the current value of `i` is already at the upper limit (`len(letters)`).

4. **Next Iteration Requirement:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` should be incremented to `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop variable `i`.

6. **New State:**
   - `letters` remains the same.
   - `row` remains the same.
   - `matrix` remains the same.
   - `i` becomes `len(letters) + 1`.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to the length of `letters`.

Given this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `letters` is a non-empty string, `row` is a list containing all the letters from `letters`, `matrix` is a list of lists where each sublist contains a single character from `letters` in order plus an additional sublist which is `row`, `i` is equal to the length of `letters` + 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to the length of `letters`**.
