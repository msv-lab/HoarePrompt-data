Postcondition: ***`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0), `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of the original `selected_words` and the character at position `[n-1][0]` of the matrix, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `0`, if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, `selected_words` is updated accordingly.***
