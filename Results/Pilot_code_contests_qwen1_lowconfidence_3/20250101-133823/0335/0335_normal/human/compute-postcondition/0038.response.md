State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row, `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and `m` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `j` is initialized to 0 before entering the loop, as given in the state (`i` is 0).
2. For the loop to execute, the range function needs to generate at least one value for `j`. The range function `range(m)` will generate values from 0 to `m-1`.
3. Therefore, `m` must be greater than 0 to ensure the range generates at least one value (i.e., 0).
4. The other variables (`n`, `matrix`, `selected_words`, and `i`) are already correctly stated and do not affect the loop's execution based on the provided code.

Hence, the necessary adjustments include ensuring `j` starts at 0 and `m` is greater than 0.
