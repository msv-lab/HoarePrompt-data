According to the given code, the loop iterates over the columns `j` in the range from `0` to `m-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:

- `n` is the number of rows in the matrix
- `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0)
- `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters
- `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the first row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False
- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` is `m-1`

The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `j` must be less than `m`. Since `j` is currently `m-1`, the loop will execute one more time if `j` becomes `m`.

Let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `i` will remain `n-1` because the value of `i` does not change within the loop.
- `j` will increment by 1 from `m-1` to `m`, but since `m` is the length of each row and the maximum value `j` can take is `m-1`, `j` will become `0` in the next iteration.
- `selected_words` will remain unchanged as `func_2(matrix, i, j)` was already evaluated for `j = m-1` and no update was made.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0), `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the first row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `0`**
