The code appends the character at `matrix[i][j]` to `selected_words`. Given that `i` is `n-1` and `j` is `m-1`, and `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, the character at `matrix[n-1][m-1]` is added to `selected_words`.

Since `selected_words` was previously the concatenation of all characters in the first row where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, adding the character at `matrix[n-1][m-1]` updates `selected_words`.

Output State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0), `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the first row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False plus the character at `matrix[n-1][m-1]`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, and `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False**
