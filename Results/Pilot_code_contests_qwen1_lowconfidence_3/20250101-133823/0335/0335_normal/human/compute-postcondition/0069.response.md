Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `n` is the number of rows in the matrix.
   - `m` is the length of each row, and it must be greater than 0 and at least 1.
   - `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters.
   - `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the last row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False.
   - If `func_2(matrix, 1, 2)` returns False, `selected_words` is updated to include `matrix[1][2]`.

2. **Loop Analysis**: The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must be less than `m`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - `j` starts from `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration.
   - At the end of the last iteration, let's assume `j` was `j_end`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j_end + 1` must be less than `m`.
   - Therefore, `j` will be `j_end + 1` in the next iteration.

4. **State Update**:
   - `n` remains unchanged because it represents the number of rows in the matrix, which does not change during the loop.
   - `m` remains unchanged because it is the length of each row, which does not change during the loop.
   - `matrix` remains unchanged because the loop only modifies `j`, and no new values are added or removed from the matrix.
   - `selected_words` remains unchanged unless `func_2(matrix, 1, 2)` returns False, but since the loop has already run, this condition would have been checked before the current iteration.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0 and at least 1), `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the last row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, and `j` is `j_end + 1` where `j_end` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration.**
