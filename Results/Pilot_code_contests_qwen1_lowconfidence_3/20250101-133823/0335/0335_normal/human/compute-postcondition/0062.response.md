According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. The loop starts with `j` as 1 and iterates over the range from 0 to `m-1`. For the loop to execute, `j` must be within the range defined by `m`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the number of rows in the matrix
- `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0)
- `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters
- `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the last row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 0

The loop will start with `j` as 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is within the valid range for the loop to execute.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop starts with `j` as 1.
2. The loop will continue as long as `j < m`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `j` (which starts at 1) must be less than `m`.

Since `m` is the length of each row and must be greater than 0, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 1 for the loop to execute even once.

State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0 and at least 1), `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the last row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1**
