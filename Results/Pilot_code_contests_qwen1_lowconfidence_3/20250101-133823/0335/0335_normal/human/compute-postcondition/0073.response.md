To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given loop and the provided output states step by step.

### Loop Analysis

The loop iterates over each element in the matrix and appends characters to `selected_words` if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`.

### Provided Output States

- **After 1 iteration:**
  - `n` is the number of rows in the matrix
  - `m` is the length of each row
  - `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters
  - `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the first row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`
  - `i` is `n-1` (which is 0 since the first row is considered)
  - `j` is `m-1`

- **After 2 iterations:**
  - `n` is the number of rows in the matrix
  - `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0)
  - `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters
  - `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the last row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`
  - `i` is 0
  - `j` is 0

- **After 3 iterations:**
  - `n` is the number of rows in the matrix
  - `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0 and at least 1)
  - `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters
  - `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the last row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`
  - `j` is `m - 1`

### Generalization

From the provided output states, we can infer that the loop iterates through every element in the matrix and collects characters into `selected_words` if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`. The loop processes the entire matrix row by row.

### Final Output State

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `selected_words` will contain the concatenation of all characters in the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`. The values of `n` and `m` will reflect the dimensions of the matrix.

### Output State

**Output State:**
- `n` is the number of rows in the matrix
- `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0 and at least 1)
- `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters
- `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`

Thus, the final output state is:

**Output State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row (must be greater than 0 and at least 1), `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`.**
