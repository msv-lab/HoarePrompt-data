Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `letters` must be a non-empty string.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to the length of `letters`.
- `row` is a list containing the first character of `letters`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for letter in letters:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character in `letters`.
2. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `row` contains the first character of `letters`. This means that at least one character has already been processed.

### Steps to Determine the Next State:
1. **Character Processing**: Each iteration of the loop processes one character from `letters`.
2. **Updating `row`**: After processing the first character (which is already in `row`), the next character in `letters` should be added to `row`.

### Updated State:
- Since `row` initially contained the first character and now we are starting the next iteration, `row` should now contain the first two characters of `letters`.
- `letters` itself does not change because the loop has not yet processed all characters.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration of the loop, the updated state should reflect that `row` now contains the first two characters of `letters`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`letters` must be a non-empty string, `n` must be greater than or equal to the length of `letters`, `row` is a list containing the first two characters of `letters`**
