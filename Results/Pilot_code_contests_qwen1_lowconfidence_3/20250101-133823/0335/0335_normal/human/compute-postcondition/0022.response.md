The code `row.append(letter)` appends the variable `letter` to the list `row`. Given the initial state, `letters` is a non-empty string, `row` is a list containing the next letter from `letters` with the latest letter appended, `matrix` is a list of lists starting with `[row]` plus the previous row, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 0. 

After executing `row.append(letter)`, the last element of `row` will be updated to include the new `letter`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`letters` is a non-empty string, `row` is the list containing the next letter from `letters` with the latest letter appended and one additional element, `matrix` is `[row]` plus the previous row, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
