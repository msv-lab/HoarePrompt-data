Output State: **`n` is the number of rows in the matrix, `m` is the length of each row, `matrix` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains `m` characters, `selected_words` is the concatenation of all characters in the first row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, `i` is `n-1`, and `j` is `m-1`.**

### Explanation:
- **Matrix:** The matrix remains unchanged throughout the loop because the loop only modifies the `selected_words` string based on the evaluation of `func_2(matrix, i, j)`.
- **Selected Words:** The `selected_words` string is built by appending characters from the first row of the matrix whenever `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`. This process continues until `j` reaches the end of the row (`m-1`).
- **Indices i and j:** Since the loop iterates over each column in the first row, `i` remains `0` and `j` starts from `0` and increments until it reaches `m-1`.

Thus, after the loop finishes executing, `selected_words` will contain the concatenation of all characters in the first row of the matrix where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, and the indices `i` and `j` will reflect the last column processed in the first row.
