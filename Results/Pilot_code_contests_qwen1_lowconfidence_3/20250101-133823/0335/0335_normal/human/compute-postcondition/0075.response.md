The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly. However, it implies that there is an external matrix which is an n × m 2D list where each element is a lowercase Latin letter. The function does not modify this matrix but rather uses it as part of its processing. 

Case_1: The function returns a specific value or result based on some operation performed on the matrix.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to use a given n × m 2D list (matrix) where each element is a lowercase Latin letter and return a specific value or result based on some operation performed on the matrix.
