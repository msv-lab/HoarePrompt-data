The function processes two sorted integer sequences \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) and \(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n\), where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9\). It reads these sequences from standard input, constructs a list \(T\) of length \(2n\) containing tuples of the form \((a, i, 0)\) or \((b, i, 1)\) based on the input values, sorts \(T\) by the first element of each tuple, and then creates two lists \(a\) and \(b\) of length \(n\) where each element is set to 1 if the corresponding value from the input appears in the second half of the sorted list \(T\). Finally, it outputs a string representation of the lists \(a\) and \(b\) concatenated together, with a newline separating them.
