The code snippet `T.append((b, i, 1))` appends a tuple `(b, i, 1)` to the list `T`. Let's break this down:

- `i` is currently set to 2.
- `b` is the second integer read.
- `T` is currently `[('a', 0, 0), ('b', 0, 1), ('a', 1, 0), ('b', 1, 1), ('a', 2, 0)]`.

After executing the line `T.append((b, i, 1))`, the new tuple `(b, 2, 1)` is appended to the list `T`. So the updated list `T` becomes `[('a', 0, 0), ('b', 0, 1), ('a', 1, 0), ('b', 1, 1), ('a', 2, 0), (b, 2, 1)]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the first integer read, `b` is the second integer read, B is [the first integer, the second integer, the second integer, the second integer], `T` is [('a', 0, 0), ('b', 0, 1), ('a', 1, 0), ('b', 1, 1), ('a', 2, 0), (b, 2, 1)], `A` is [the first integer read, the first integer read]**
