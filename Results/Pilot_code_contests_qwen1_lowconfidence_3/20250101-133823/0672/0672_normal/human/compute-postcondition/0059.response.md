`Ans` is a string initially set to `"a[0]a[1]...a[n-1]"`. The code snippet `Ans += '\n'` appends a newline character (`'\n'`) to the end of the string `Ans`. The variables `i`, `a`, `b`, and `T` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of length `n` with specific values based on `T`, `b` is a list of length `n` with specific values based on `T`, `T` is a list of length \(2n\) with specific tuples based on `A` and `B`, `Ans` is the string "a[0]a[1]...a[n-1]\n"**
