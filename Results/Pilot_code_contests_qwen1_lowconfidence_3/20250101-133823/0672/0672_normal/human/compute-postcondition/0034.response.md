The code `b[i] = 1` sets the value of `b[i]` to 1, where `i` is 3. Based on the initial state, `b` is a list of length `n` with specific values at indices 0, 1, and 2. Since `i` is 3, this index is within the bounds of the list `b`. Therefore, `b[3]` is set to 1. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `A` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `B` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `T` is a list of length `2n` containing tuples of the form `(a, i, 0)` or `(b, i, 1)` sorted by the first element of each tuple in ascending order, `a` is a list of length `n` with `a[0]` set to `1`, `a[2]` set to `1`, and `a[3]` set to `1`, `b` is a list of length `n` with `b[0]` set to `0`, `b[1]` set to `1`, `b[2]` set to `1`, and `b[3]` set to `1`, `i` is 3**
