`B.append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `B`. Since `B` was initially a list containing `a`, after appending `b`, `B` will contain both `a` and `b`. The value of `b` is an integer read from standard input, so it remains as `b`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `a` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is in `B`, `B` contains `a` and `b`**
