`T.append((a, i, 0))` appends a tuple `(a, i, 0)` to the list `T`. Since `i` is 0, the tuple becomes `(a, 0, 0)`. The value of `n` remains greater than 0, `a` is still in `B`, and `B` still contains `a` and `b`. The variable `i` is not altered by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is in `B`, `B` contains `a` and `b`, `T` contains the tuple `(a, 0, 0)`**
