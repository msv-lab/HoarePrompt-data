The code snippet `A.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `A`. Before the code is executed, `A` does not exist. After the code is executed, `A` becomes a list containing the value of `a`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer read from standard input, `A` is a list containing `a`**
