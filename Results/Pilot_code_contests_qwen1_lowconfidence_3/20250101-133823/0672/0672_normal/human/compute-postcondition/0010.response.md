Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `a` is in `B`
- `B` contains `a` and `b`
- `T` contains the tuples `(a, 0, 0)` and `(b, 0, 1)`

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`, which means the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

### End of Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 0 (since it starts from 0 and increases by 1 each iteration)
- `n` is still greater than 0 (no information suggests otherwise)

### Next Iteration:
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1.

Since `i` is now 1, we need to check if `i < n` to ensure the loop can continue. Given that `n` is greater than 0, the condition `i < n` will be true as long as `n` remains greater than 0.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` is now 1
- `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue
- The other states (`a` in `B`, `B` containing `a` and `b`, and `T` containing the tuples) remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations are specified that would affect these variables.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is in `B`, `B` contains `a` and `b`, `T` contains the tuples `(a, 0, 0)` and `(b, 0, 1)`**
