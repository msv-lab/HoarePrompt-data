`T` is appended with the tuple `(a, i, 0)`. Given that `i` is initially 2, the new tuple added to `T` is `(a, 2, 0)`. The values of `a`, `b`, `B`, `T`, and `A` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the first integer read, `b` is the second integer read, `B` is [the first integer, the second integer, the second integer, the second integer], `T` is [(`a`, 0, 0), (`b`, 0, 1), (`a`, 1, 0), (`b`, 1, 1), (a, 2, 0)], `A` is [the first integer read, the first integer read]**
