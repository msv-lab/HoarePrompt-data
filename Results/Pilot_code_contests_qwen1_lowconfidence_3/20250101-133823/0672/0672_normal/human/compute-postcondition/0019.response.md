`B` is a list containing the first integer read, the second integer read, and the second integer read again. The code appends `b` to the list `B`. Since `b` is the second integer read, appending it to `B` means adding another instance of `b` to the list. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the first integer read, `b` is the second integer read, `B` is [the first integer, the second integer, the second integer, the second integer], `T` is [(`a`, 0, 0), (`b`, 0, 1), (`a`, 1, 0), (`b`, 1, 1)], `A` is [the first integer read, the first integer read]**
