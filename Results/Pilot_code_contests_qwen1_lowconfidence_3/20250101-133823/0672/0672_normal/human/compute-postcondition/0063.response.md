The code `Ans += str(b[i])` concatenates the string representation of `b[i]` to the variable `Ans`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is less than `n` and equal to `i + 1`
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of length `n` with specific values based on `T`
- `b` is a list of length `n` with specific values based on `T`
- `T` is a list of length \(2n\) with specific tuples based on `A` and `B`
- `Ans` is the string "a[0]a[1]...a[n-1]\n" + `str(b[i])`

Since `i` is less than `n` and equal to `i + 1`, this implies that `i` is 0 (since `i` cannot be -1 and `i + 1` must be less than `n`). Therefore, the code `Ans += str(b[i])` effectively appends `str(b[0])` to `Ans`.

The updated `Ans` will be the original content of `Ans` plus `str(b[0])`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of length `n` with specific values based on `T`, `b` is a list of length `n` with specific values based on `T`, `T` is a list of length \(2n\) with specific tuples based on `A` and `B`, `Ans` is "a[0]a[1]...a[n-1]\n" + `str(b[0])`**
