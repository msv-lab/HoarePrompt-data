`Ans` is assigned the value of `Ans` concatenated with `str(a[i])`. The value of `a` is not given in the initial state, and `i` is 0, but since `a` is not defined, this operation cannot be performed directly. However, assuming `a` is a list and `i` refers to an index within that list, the value of `Ans` will be updated by concatenating the string representation of `a[0]` to `Ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `Ans` is `Ans` concatenated with `str(a[0])`**
