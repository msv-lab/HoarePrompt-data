`n` is assigned the value `int(sys.stdin.readline())`. This reads an integer from standard input and converts it to an integer type. The values of the sequences `a1, a2, ..., an` and `b1, b2, ..., bn` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the sequences `a1, a2, ..., an` and `b1, b2, ..., bn` are integers such that 1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ 10^9 and both sequences are sorted in ascending order.**
