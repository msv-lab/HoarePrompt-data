Postcondition: **`i` is `n // 2`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is less than `n`, `A` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `B` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `T` is a list of length \(2n\) containing tuples of the form `(a, i, 0)` or `(b, i, 1)` sorted by the first element of each tuple in ascending order, `a` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0, `b` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0, and the current value of `T[i][-1]` is 0**.
