`T.append((a, i, 0))` appends a tuple `(a, i, 0)` to the list `T`. Given that `i` is 1 and `a` is the first integer read, the new tuple added to `T` is `(a, 1, 0)`. The other lists and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the first integer read, `b` is the second integer read, `B` is [the first integer, the second integer, the second integer], `T` is [(`a`, 0, 0), (`b`, 0, 1), (`a`, 1, 0)], `A` is [the first integer read]**
