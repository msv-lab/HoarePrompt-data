`A.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `A`. Since `a` is the first integer read and the initial state of `A` is `[the first integer read]`, after appending `a` to `A`, `A` becomes `[the first integer read, the first integer read]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the first integer read, `b` is the second integer read, B is [the first integer, the second integer, the second integer], `T` is [(`a`, 0, 0), (`b`, 0, 1), (`a`, 1, 0), (`b`, 1, 1)], `A` is [the first integer read, the first integer read]**
