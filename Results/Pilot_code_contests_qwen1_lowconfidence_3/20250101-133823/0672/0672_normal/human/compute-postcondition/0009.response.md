The code appends a new tuple `(b, i, 1)` to the list `T`. Initially, `T` contains the tuple `(a, 0, 0)`. Since `i` is 0, the new tuple added to `T` will be `(b, 0, 1)`. The value of `n` remains greater than 0, `a` is still in `B`, `B` still contains `a` and `b`, and `T` now contains both `(a, 0, 0)` and `(b, 0, 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is in `B`, `B` contains `a` and `b`, `T` contains the tuples `(a, 0, 0)` and `(b, 0, 1)`**
