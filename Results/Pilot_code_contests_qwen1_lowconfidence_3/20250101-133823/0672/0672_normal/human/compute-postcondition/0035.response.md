Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `A` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `B` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `T` is a list of length \(2n\) containing tuples of the form `(a, i, 0)` or `(b, i, 1)` sorted by the first element of each tuple in ascending order, `a` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0, `b` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0, `i` is `n // 2`.**

### Explanation:
- **Loop Execution:** The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n // 2 - 1`. For each iteration, it sets `a[i]` and `b[i]` to 1.
- **Final Values:**
  - After the loop completes, `i` will be `n // 2`.
  - All elements of `a` and `b` up to index `n // 2 - 1` will be set to 1, and all other elements will remain 0.
- **No Change in Other Variables:**
  - `A` and `B` lists remain unchanged.
  - `T` list remains unchanged since no operations are performed on it inside the loop.
  - `a` and `b` lists are modified only within the loop, but they are reset to their original values outside the loop scope.

Since the loop runs exactly `n // 2` times (assuming `n` is even; for odd `n`, the last assignment will still result in `n // 2` iterations fully executing), the final state of `a` and `b` will have all elements up to `n // 2 - 1` set to 1, and all others set to 0.
