`Ans` is initially defined as `"a[0]a[1]...a[n-1]\n"` + `str(b[0])`. The code snippet updates `Ans` by appending `str(b[i])` to `Ans`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the value being appended is `b[1]`.

Therefore, the updated `Ans` will be:
- The initial part `"a[0]a[1]...a[n-1]\n"` remains unchanged.
- `str(b[0])` from the initial `Ans` is followed by `str(b[1])`.

So, the new value of `Ans` will be: `"a[0]a[1]...a[n-1]\n"` + `str(b[0])` + `str(b[1])`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of length `n` with specific values based on `T`, `b` is a list of length `n` with specific values based on `T`, `T` is a list of length \(2n\) with specific tuples based on `A` and `B`, `Ans` is `"a[0]a[1]...a[n-1]\n"` + `str(b[0])` + `str(b[1])`**
