The code `T.sort()` sorts the list `T` in ascending order. The original elements in `T` are tuples of the form `(a, i, 0)` or `(b, i, 1)`. After sorting, these tuples will be arranged based on their first element (either `a` or `b`) in ascending order. The indices `i` and the additional attributes `0` or `1` will maintain their association with the sorted `a` or `b`.

The initial state includes:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `A` is a list of length `n` containing integers.
- `B` is a list of length `n` containing integers.
- `T` is a list of length \(2n\) containing tuples of the form `(a, i, 0)` or `(b, i, 1)`.

After sorting `T`, the output state will reflect the sorted tuples without changing the values of `n`, `A`, or `B`. The only change is in the order of the tuples in `T`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `A` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `B` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `T` is a list of length \(2n\) containing tuples of the form `(a, i, 0)` or `(b, i, 1)` sorted by the first element of each tuple in ascending order.**
