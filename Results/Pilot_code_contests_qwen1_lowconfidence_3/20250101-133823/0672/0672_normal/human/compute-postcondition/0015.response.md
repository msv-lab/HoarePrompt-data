The tuple `(b, i, 1)` is appended to list `T`. The value of `i` is initially 1, and since the code only updates `T`, the value of `i` remains unchanged. The value of `b` is the second integer read, and the value of `a` and `n` remain as they were in the initial state. The lists `B` and `A` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the first integer read, `b` is the second integer read, `B` is [the first integer, the second integer, the second integer], `T` is [(`a`, 0, 0), (`b`, 0, 1), (`a`, 1, 0), (`b`, 1, 1)], `A` is [the first integer read]**
