`B` is a list containing the first integer and the second integer. The code appends the second integer `b` to the list `B`. Therefore, the updated list `B` will contain three elements: the first integer, the second integer, and the second integer again. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the first integer read, `b` is the second integer read, `B` is [the first integer, the second integer, the second integer], `T` is [(`a`, 0, 0), (`b`, 0, 1)], `A` is [the first integer read]**
