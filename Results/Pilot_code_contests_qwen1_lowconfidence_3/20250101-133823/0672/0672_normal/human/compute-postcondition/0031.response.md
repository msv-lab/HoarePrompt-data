The code `b[i] = 1` updates the value of `b[i]` to 1. Given that `i` is initially 2, the value of `b[2]` is updated to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 10^5\), `A` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `B` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `T` is a list of length \(2n\) containing tuples of the form `(a, i, 0)` or `(b, i, 1)` sorted by the first element of each tuple in ascending order, `a` is a list of length `n` with `a[0]` set to `1` and `a[2]` set to `1`, `b` is a list of length `n` with `b[0]` set to `0` and `b[1]` set to `1`, `i` is `2`, `b[2]` is `1**.
