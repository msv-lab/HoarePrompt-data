The code `a[i] = 1` updates the value of `a[i]` to 1. Given that `i` is 3, the value of `a[3]` is updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `A` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `B` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `T` is a list of length \(2n\) containing tuples of the form `(a, i, 0)` or `(b, i, 1)` sorted by the first element of each tuple in ascending order, `a` is a list of length `n` with `a[0]` set to `1`, `a[2]` set to `1`, and `a[3]` set to `1`, `b` is a list of length `n` with `b[0]` set to `0`, `b[1]` set to `1`, and `b[2]` set to `1`, `i` is 3**
