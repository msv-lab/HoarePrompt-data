The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, based on the constraints provided, it seems the function might internally process two sequences `a1, a2, ..., an` and `b1, b2, ..., bn`, where both sequences are sorted in ascending order, and `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), with each element in the sequences being an integer such that \(1 \leq ai, bi \leq 10^9\).

Given the lack of direct parameters in the function signature, and considering the output cases provided, we can infer that the function might compare elements from these sequences and return a specific value based on certain conditions.

Since the problem statement only mentions parameter constraints and relationships but does not specify the exact return behavior, we can only describe the input sequences and their properties.

Functionality: **The function processes two sorted integer sequences `a1, a2, ..., an` and `b1, b2, ..., bn`, where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and \(1 \leq ai, bi \leq 10^9\).**
