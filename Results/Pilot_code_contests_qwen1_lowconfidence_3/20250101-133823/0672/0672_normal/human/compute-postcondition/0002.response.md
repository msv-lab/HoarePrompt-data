The code `B = []` creates a new empty list and assigns it to the variable `B`. The variable `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the sequences `a1, a2, ..., an` and `b1, b2, ..., bn` remain as described. The list `A` remains an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the sequences `a1, a2, ..., an` and `b1, b2, ..., bn` are integers such that 1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ 10^9 and both sequences are sorted in ascending order; `A` is an empty list; `B` is an empty list**
