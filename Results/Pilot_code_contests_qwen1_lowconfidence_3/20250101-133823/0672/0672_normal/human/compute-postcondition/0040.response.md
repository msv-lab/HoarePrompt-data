The code `b[T[i][1]] = 1` updates the value of `b` at the index `T[i][1]` to 1. Given the initial state:

- `i` is `n // 2`
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `i` is less than `n`
- `A` is a list of length `n` containing integers
- `B` is a list of length `n` containing integers
- `T` is a list of length \(2n\) containing tuples of the form `(a, i, 0)` or `(b, i, 1)` sorted by the first element of each tuple in ascending order
- `a` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0
- `b` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0
- `T[i][-1]` is not equal to 0

We know that `T[i][1]` refers to the second element of the tuple at index `i` in the list `T`. Since `T` is sorted by the first element of each tuple in ascending order, the value of `T[i][1]` is a valid index within the range of `b`.

After executing the code, the value of `b[T[i][1]]` is updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is less than `n`, `A` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `B` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `T` is a list of length \(2n\) containing tuples of the form `(a, i, 0)` or `(b, i, 1)` sorted by the first element of each tuple in ascending order, `a` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0, `b` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `b[T[i][1]]` which is 1, and `T[i][-1]` is not equal to 0**
