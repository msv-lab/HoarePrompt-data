The code `a[T[i][1]] = 1` updates the value of `a` at the index specified by the second element of the tuple `T[i]`. Given that `T[i][-1]` is 0, the third element of the tuple is 0, indicating that the tuple is of the form `(a, i, 0)`. This means the index in `a` to be updated is `T[i][1]`.

From the initial state, `T` is a list of length \(2n\) containing tuples sorted by the first element of each tuple in ascending order, and the current value of `T[i][-1]` is 0, which means `T[i]` is of the form `(a, i, 0)`.

Since `a` is a list of length `n` with all elements initially set to 0, updating `a[T[i][1]]` will set the element at the index `T[i][1]` in `a` to 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is less than `n`, `A` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `B` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `T` is a list of length \(2n\) containing tuples of the form `(a, i, 0)` or `(b, i, 1)` sorted by the first element of each tuple in ascending order, `a` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except for the element at index `T[i][1]` which is now 1, `b` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0, and the current value of `T[i][-1]` is 0.**
