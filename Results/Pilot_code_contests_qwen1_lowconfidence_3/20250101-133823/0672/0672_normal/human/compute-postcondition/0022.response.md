Let's analyze the loop step by step and determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed \( n \) times.

### Initial State:
- \( n \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 \).
- Sequences `a1, a2, ..., an` and `b1, b2, ..., bn` are integers such that \( 1 \leq ai, bi \leq 10^9 \) and both sequences are sorted in ascending order.
- `A` is an empty list.
- `B` is an empty list.
- `T` is an empty list.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(n):
    a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    A.append(a)
    B.append(b)
    T.append((a, i, 0))
    T.append((b, i, 1))
```

### Analysis of Loop Execution:
1. **For each iteration \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \):**
   - The line `a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())` reads two integers from standard input and assigns them to `a` and `b`.
   - `A.append(a)` appends the integer `a` to the list `A`.
   - `B.append(b)` appends the integer `b` to the list `B`.
   - `T.append((a, i, 0))` appends a tuple containing `a`, the index `i`, and `0` to the list `T`.
   - `T.append((b, i, 1))` appends a tuple containing `b`, the index `i`, and `1` to the list `T`.

### Final State After the Loop Executes \( n \) Times:
- The loop will execute exactly \( n \) times because `range(n)` generates \( n \) numbers from 0 to \( n-1 \).
- Therefore, after the loop completes:
  - `A` will contain exactly \( n \) elements, which are the integers read from the input.
  - `B` will also contain exactly \( n \) elements, which are the integers read from the input.
  - `T` will contain exactly \( 2n \) elements, where each element is a tuple of the form `(a, i, 0)` or `(b, i, 1)` for each `i` from 0 to \( n-1 \).

### Conclusion:
The final state of the variables after the loop has executed all \( n \) iterations is:
- `n` remains the same as the initial integer.
- `A` is a list containing \( n \) integers, each read from the input.
- `B` is a list containing \( n \) integers, each read from the input.
- `T` is a list containing \( 2n \) tuples, each representing either `a` or `b` along with the corresponding index and a flag (0 or 1).

### Output State:
**Output State: `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), `A` is a list of length `n` containing the integers read from the input, `B` is a list of length `n` containing the integers read from the input, `T` is a list of length \( 2n \) containing tuples of the form `(a, i, 0)` or `(b, i, 1)` where `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input and `i` is the index of the corresponding tuple in the list.**
