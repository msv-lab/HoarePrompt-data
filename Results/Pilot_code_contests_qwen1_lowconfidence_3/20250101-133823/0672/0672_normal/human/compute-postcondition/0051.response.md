The provided code snippet assigns an empty string to the variable `Ans`. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the assignment to `Ans`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `A` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `B` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `T` is a list of length \(2n\) containing tuples of the form `(a, i, 0)` or `(b, i, 1)` sorted by the first element of each tuple in ascending order, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[j]` is 1 if there exists any tuple `(a, k, 0)` in `T` such that `k == j` and `k >= n // 2`, otherwise `a[j]` is 0, `b` is a list of length `n` where `b[j]` is 1 if there exists any tuple `(b, k, 1)` in `T` such that `k == j` and `k >= n // 2`, otherwise `b[j]` is 0, `Ans` is an empty string.**
