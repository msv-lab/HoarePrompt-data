`a` and `b` are assigned the values from `sys.stdin.readline().split()` converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer read from standard input, `b` is an integer read from standard input.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer read from standard input, `b` is an integer read from standard input**
