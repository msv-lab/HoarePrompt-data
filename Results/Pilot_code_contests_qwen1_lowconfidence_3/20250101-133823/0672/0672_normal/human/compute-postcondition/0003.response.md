The code initializes an empty list `T`. This does not affect the values of `n`, the sequences `a1, a2, ..., an` and `b1, b2, ..., bn`, or the lists `A` and `B`. Therefore, the only change is that `T` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the sequences `a1, a2, ..., an` and `b1, b2, ..., bn` are integers such that 1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ 10^9 and both sequences are sorted in ascending order; `A` is an empty list; `B` is an empty list; `T` is an empty list**
