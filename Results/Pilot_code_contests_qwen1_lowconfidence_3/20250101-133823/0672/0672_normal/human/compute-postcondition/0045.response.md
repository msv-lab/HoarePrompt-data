Postcondition: ***`i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is less than `n`, `A` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `B` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `T` is a list of length \(2n\) containing tuples of the form `(a, i, 0)` or `(b, i, 1)` sorted by the first element of each tuple in ascending order. If `T[i][-1] == 0`, then `a[T[i][1]]` is 1. Otherwise, `b[T[i][1]]` is 1.***
