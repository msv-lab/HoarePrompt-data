`i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `b[i]` (which is `b[1]`) is assigned the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 10^5\), `A` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `B` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `T` is a list of length \(2n\) containing tuples of the form `(a, i, 0)` or `(b, i, 1)` sorted by the first element of each tuple in ascending order, `a` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0, except `a[0]` which is 1, `b` is a list of length `n` with `b[0]` set to 0 and `b[1]` set to 1, `i` is 1**
