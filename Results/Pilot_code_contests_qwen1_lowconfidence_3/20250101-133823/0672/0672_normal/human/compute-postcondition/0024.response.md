The code initializes a list `a` of length `n` with all elements set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `A`, `B`, or `T`. Therefore, the only change is in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `A` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `B` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `T` is a list of length \(2n\) containing tuples of the form `(a, i, 0)` or `(b, i, 1)` sorted by the first element of each tuple in ascending order, `a` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0.**
