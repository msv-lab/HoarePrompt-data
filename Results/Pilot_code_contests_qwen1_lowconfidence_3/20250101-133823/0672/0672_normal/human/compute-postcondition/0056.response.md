Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `Ans` is `Ans` concatenated with `str(a[0])` and then with `str(a[1])`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is currently 2.

4. **Determine `n`:**
   - Since `i` is currently 2 and it needs to be less than `n` for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

5. **Update `Ans`:**
   - `Ans` is updated by concatenating `str(a[0])` and then `str(a[1])` during each iteration.
   - After the current iteration (where `i` was 2), `Ans` would have already included the concatenations of `str(a[0])` and `str(a[1])`.

6. **Next Iteration:**
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - Therefore, `Ans` should be updated for `i` being 3, which means it should include the concatenations up to `a[2]` if `a` has at least 3 elements.

7. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `Ans` should now include the concatenation of `str(a[0])`, `str(a[1])`, and `str(a[2])`.

Based on these steps, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is 3, `Ans` is `Ans` concatenated with `str(a[0])`, `str(a[1])`, and `str(a[2])`**
