The code `Ans += str(a[i])` concatenates the string `str(a[i])` to the end of the string `Ans`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `Ans` is `Ans` concatenated with `str(a[0])`. However, the value of `a` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `Ans` after the operation. We can only state that `Ans` now includes the string representation of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `Ans` is `Ans` concatenated with `str(a[0])` and then with `str(a[1])`**
