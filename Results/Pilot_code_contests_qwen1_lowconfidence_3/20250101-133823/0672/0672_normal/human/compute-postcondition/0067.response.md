The code `sys.stdout.write(Ans)` writes the value of the variable `Ans` to the standard output. However, this operation does not change the values of the variables in the memory. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `T`, and `Ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of length `n` with specific values based on `T`, `b` is a list of length `n` with specific values based on `T`, `T` is a list of length \(2n\) with specific tuples based on `A` and `B`, `Ans` is the string "a[0]a[1]...a[n-1]\n" + "".join(map(str, b))**
