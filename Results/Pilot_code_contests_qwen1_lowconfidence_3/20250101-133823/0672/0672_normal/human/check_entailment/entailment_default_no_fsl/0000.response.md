Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code sets the first `n//2` elements of both lists `a` and `b` to 1, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The description states that from each semifinal, we choose `k` people who showed the best result, and the remaining spots in the finals are filled by the `n - 2k` best performers among those who did not rank in the top `k`.

Here is an example to illustrate the issue:

For the input:
```
4
9840 9920
9860 9980
9930 10020
10040 10090
```

The correct output should be:
```
1110
1100
```

However, the provided code would output:
```
1110
1110
```

This is because the code incorrectly sets the first `n//2` elements to 1 for both semifinals, regardless of the actual values of `a` and `b`. To fix this, the code needs to correctly determine the cutoff for the top `k` performers in each semifinal and ensure that the remaining spots are filled by the `n - 2k` best performers from the rest.
