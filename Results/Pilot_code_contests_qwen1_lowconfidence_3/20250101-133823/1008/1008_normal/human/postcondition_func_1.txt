The function reads three space-separated integers from standard input, representing the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the number of tubes (k) respectively. These values are returned as a list. The constraints are 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 300 and 2 ≤ 2k ≤ n·m. The function does not accept any parameters. The function does not perform any additional checks beyond the specified constraints, so it is expected that the user provides valid input within these bounds. If invalid input is provided, the program behavior is undefined.
