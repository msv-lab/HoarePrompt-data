Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program appears to meet the requirements of the problem description. It correctly arranges \( k \) tubes on an \( n \times m \) table in a way that no two tubes share any cells and every cell is covered by exactly one tube. 

Here's a brief reasoning:
- The program iterates over the table in a zigzag pattern, ensuring that each cell is visited exactly once.
- It alternates between moving right and left across the rows to ensure that no cells are shared between tubes.
- After placing \( k-1 \) tubes with two cells each, it places the remaining cells in the last tube.

Given the constraints and the approach, the program should work for all valid inputs where \( 2 \leq n, m \leq 300 \) and \( 2 \leq 2k \leq nm \). Since the problem guarantees at least one solution exists, and the program covers all cells without overlap, it satisfies the conditions of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
