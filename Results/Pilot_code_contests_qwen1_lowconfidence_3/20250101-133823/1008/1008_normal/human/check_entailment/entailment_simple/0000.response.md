Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Tube Placement Logic**:
   - The function `func_6()` tries to place tubes on the table in a linear manner, but it does not ensure that each cell of the table belongs to exactly one tube and that no two tubes share any cells.
   - Specifically, the logic used to fill the `store` list with coordinates does not guarantee a solution where each cell is part of exactly one tube and no two tubes share any cells.

2. **Output Format**:
   - The output format specified in the problem description requires that the program prints `k` lines, where each line describes a tube. Each line should start with the number of cells (`ri`) in the tube followed by the coordinates of those cells.
   - The provided code does not generate tubes in such a way that ensures the output matches the required format. Instead, it prints a series of coordinates without ensuring that the tubes are disjoint and cover all cells.

3. **Fancy Arrangement**:
   - The problem description states that the arrangement of tubes should be such that no two tubes share any cells and each cell belongs to exactly one tube.
   - The provided code does not implement a strategy to achieve this fancy arrangement. It simply iterates over the grid in a linear fashion, which does not guarantee the required properties.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
3 3 3
```
The expected output would be a set of three tubes, each covering exactly two cells, and no two tubes sharing any cells. The provided program might output something like:
```
2 1 1 1 2
2 2 1 2 3
4 1 3 2 3 3 3
```
However, this is incorrect because:
- The third tube is invalid as it covers four cells instead of two.
- The tubes are not disjoint, and the cells are not properly covered.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a backtracking algorithm to ensure that each tube is placed correctly and that the conditions are met. The provided code does not implement such a strategy and hence does not meet the requirements of the problem.
