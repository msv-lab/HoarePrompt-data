Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_6` does not generate a sequence of tubes that cover the entire table in a fancy manner for every potential case. Specifically, the function generates a zigzag pattern starting from `(1, 1)` and ending at `(rows, cols)`, but it does not ensure that the tubes are placed in a way that each cell belongs to exactly one tube and no two tubes share any cells. The generated pattern simply lists all cells in a zigzag order, which does not guarantee that the tubes will be arranged in a fancy manner as defined in the problem description. For example, if `k` is such that the tubes cannot be perfectly divided into non-overlapping segments, the function may not produce a valid arrangement. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
