You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valera has got a rectangle table consisting of n rows and m columns. Valera numbered the table rows starting from one, from top to bottom and the columns – starting from one, from left to right. We will represent cell that is on the intersection of row x and column y by a pair of integers (x, y).

Valera wants to place exactly k tubes on his rectangle table. A tube is such sequence of table cells (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xr, yr), that: 

  * r ≥ 2; 
  * for any integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ r - 1) the following equation |xi - xi + 1| + |yi - yi + 1| = 1 holds; 
  * each table cell, which belongs to the tube, must occur exactly once in the sequence. 



Valera thinks that the tubes are arranged in a fancy manner if the following conditions are fulfilled: 

  * no pair of tubes has common cells; 
  * each cell of the table belongs to some tube. 



Help Valera to arrange k tubes on his rectangle table in a fancy manner.

Input

The first line contains three space-separated integers n, m, k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 300; 2 ≤ 2k ≤ n·m) — the number of rows, the number of columns and the number of tubes, correspondingly. 

Output

Print k lines. In the i-th line print the description of the i-th tube: first print integer ri (the number of tube cells), then print 2ri integers xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2, ..., xiri, yiri (the sequence of table cells).

If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_1` are defined or passed as parameters. The function reads input from standard input (stdin) and returns a tuple of three integers representing the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the number of tubes (k) respectively.
def func_1():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
    #The program returns a tuple of three integers (n, m, k) where n represents the number of rows, m represents the number of columns, and k represents the number of tubes, obtained by reading a line of input from standard input, stripping any trailing whitespace, and splitting the line into three integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin). It then strips any trailing whitespace from this line and splits it into three integers, which represent the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the number of tubes (k). The function returns a tuple containing these three integers. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the input line does not contain exactly three integers separated by whitespace, or if the input line is empty. In such cases, the function still performs the same operations but expects the input to conform to the specified format.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters. It reads input from standard input, which consists of three space-separated integers representing the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the number of tubes (k) respectively, where 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 300 and 2 ≤ 2k ≤ n·m.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
    #The program returns a list of three integers read from standard input, representing the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the number of tubes (k) respectively, where 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 300 and 2 ≤ 2k ≤ n·m
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three space-separated integers from standard input, representing the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the number of tubes (k) respectively. These values are returned as a list. The constraints are 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 300 and 2 ≤ 2k ≤ n·m. The function does not accept any parameters. The function does not perform any additional checks beyond the specified constraints, so it is expected that the user provides valid input within these bounds. If invalid input is provided, the program behavior is undefined.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no information provided about the variables in the function signature for this specific function. The function `func_3` reads a single line from standard input and returns it after stripping any trailing whitespace. However, based on the problem context, we can infer that the function is part of the solution to read the input values for n, m, and k.
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a string after reading a single line from standard input and stripping any trailing whitespace
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and reads a single line from standard input. It then strips any trailing whitespace from the line and returns the resulting string. Potential edge cases include the input being empty (resulting in an empty string) or the input containing only whitespace (also resulting in an empty string). There is no missing functionality as the code accurately performs the described actions.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers.
def func_4(x, y):
    while y:

    return x
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. After executing the algorithm, the function returns 0. The state of the program after the function concludes is such that `x` contains the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. However, the function explicitly returns 0 regardless of the computed GCD.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 300 and 2 ≤ 2k ≤ n * m, where n and m are derived from the input and k is the number of tubes to be placed on the table.
def func_5(x, y):
    return x * y // func_4(x, y)
    #`The program returns the integer division of x * y by the result of func_4(x, y)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`, and returns the integer division of their product (`x * y`) by the result of calling another function `func_4(x, y)`. The function assumes that `func_4(x, y)` returns a non-zero value to avoid division by zero errors. If `func_4(x, y)` returns a zero or negative value, the function behavior is undefined because integer division by zero would raise a runtime error. No edge cases or missing functionalities are identified in the provided code.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates and prints a sequence of pairs representing coordinates in a grid of size `rows` by `cols`. It first creates a list of all coordinate pairs in a zigzag pattern starting from `(1, 1)` and ending at `(rows, cols)`. Then, it prints the first `2 * (k - 1)` pairs followed by the remaining pairs in order. If the total number of pairs is less than `2 * k`, it prints the last pair without a trailing space. The function returns nothing. Potential edge cases include when `k` is 1 or when `rows * cols` is less than `2 * k`. In these cases, only the last few pairs might be printed.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
