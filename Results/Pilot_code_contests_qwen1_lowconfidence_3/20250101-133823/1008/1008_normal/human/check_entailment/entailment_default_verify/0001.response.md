Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the provided code and the problem description, the program correctly arranges \( k \) tubes on an \( n \times m \) table in a zigzag pattern, ensuring that no two tubes share any cells and every cell is covered by exactly one tube. The output hints confirm that the function generates and prints the sequence of pairs representing coordinates in a grid of the specified size. The approach taken in the program ensures that all cells are visited in a zigzag manner, and the conditions for the tubes are met. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the problem description and the given constraints.
