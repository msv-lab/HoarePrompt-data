Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly place exactly `k` tubes on the rectangle table in a fancy manner as described. Specifically, the program does not ensure that each cell of the table belongs to exactly one tube and that no two tubes share any cells. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3 3 3
```
The expected output would be a configuration where each cell is part of exactly one tube and no two tubes share any cells. However, the provided code does not guarantee this. Instead, it places tubes in a simple zigzag pattern without ensuring the tubes do not overlap or cover all cells uniquely. This can be seen in the output for the given example:

```
3 1 1 1 2 1 3
3 2 1 2 2 2 3
3 3 1 3 2 3 3
```

Here, the third tube covers the same cells as the first tube, violating the condition that no pair of tubes has common cells. Additionally, the cells are not placed in a manner that ensures each cell is part of exactly one tube.

Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
