Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided in `func_6` does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code does not ensure that each cell of the table belongs to exactly one tube, and it does not handle the case where `k` is greater than half the total number of cells in the table. Here's why:

1. **Zigzag Pattern Issue**: The code generates a zigzag pattern starting from `(1, 1)` and ending at `(rows, cols)`. While this covers all cells, it does not guarantee that the tubes are placed in a way that ensures each cell belongs to exactly one tube and no two tubes share any cells. For example, if `k` is very close to `rows * cols / 2`, the code might end up placing too many cells in the tubes, violating the condition that each cell belongs to exactly one tube.

2. **Tube Counting Issue**: The code only prints the first `2 * (k - 1)` pairs followed by the remaining pairs in order. This approach does not ensure that each cell belongs to exactly one tube and no two tubes share any cells. If `k` is such that the number of cells needed for the tubes exceeds `2 * (k - 1)`, the code will fail to cover all cells, which violates the problem requirements.

To illustrate, consider a 3x3 table with `k=3` tubes. The total number of cells is 9, and each tube needs to cover 3 cells. The zigzag pattern will cover all cells, but the code only prints 4 pairs initially and then the remaining 5 pairs sequentially, which does not ensure that each cell belongs to exactly one tube and no two tubes share any cells.

Therefore, the code is not correct for every potential case.
