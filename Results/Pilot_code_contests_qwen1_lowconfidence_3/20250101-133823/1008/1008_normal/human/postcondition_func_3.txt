The function `func_4` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. After executing the algorithm, the function returns 0. The state of the program after the function concludes is such that `x` contains the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. However, the function explicitly returns 0 regardless of the computed GCD.
