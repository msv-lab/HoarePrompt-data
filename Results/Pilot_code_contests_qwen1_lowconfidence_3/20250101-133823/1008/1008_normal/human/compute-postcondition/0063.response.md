The code `print(2, end=' ')` prints the number 2 followed by a space without a new line. This operation does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), and `count` must be 1.**
