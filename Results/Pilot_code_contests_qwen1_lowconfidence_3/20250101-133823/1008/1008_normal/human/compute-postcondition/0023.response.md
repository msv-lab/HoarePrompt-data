Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Initial State:
- `turn` is 1 if initially 0, otherwise 0.
- `store` is a list of pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for all `j` in the range `[0, cols - 1]` if `turn` was initially 0, otherwise a list of pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for all `j` in the range `[cols - 1, 0]`.
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\).
- `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\).
- `curr_x` is 0.
- `curr_y` is 0.

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(rows):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `rows`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: At the start of the loop, `i` is 0 (since the loop starts from 0 and goes up to `rows - 1`).

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` would have incremented by 1 after the previous iteration.
- Since `i` started at 0, after one iteration, `i` is now 1.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `rows`.
- Given that `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute again if `rows` is greater than 1.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` will be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.
- The condition for the loop to continue depends on `rows`, but since we are only adjusting the states based on the loop variable `i`, we don't need to change anything else.

### Final State:
State: **`turn` is 1 if initially 0, otherwise 0; `store` is a list of pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for all `j` in the range `[0, cols - 1]` if `turn` was initially 0, otherwise a list of pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for all `j` in the range `[cols - 1, 0]`; `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\); `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\); `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\); `curr_x` is 0; `curr_y` is 0; `i` is 2.**

So, the final state is:
State: **`turn` is 1 if initially 0, otherwise 0; `store` is a list of pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for all `j` in the range `[0, cols - 1]` if `turn` was initially 0, otherwise a list of pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for all `j` in the range `[cols - 1, 0]`; `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\); `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\); `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\); `curr_x` is 0; `curr_y` is 0; `i` is 2.**
