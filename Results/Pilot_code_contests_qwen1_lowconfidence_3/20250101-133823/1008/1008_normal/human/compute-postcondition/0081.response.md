The code prints the value of `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)`. The variables `rows`, `cols`, and `k` are used in this calculation. The value of `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)` is calculated and printed. However, the actual values of `rows`, `cols`, and `k` are not provided, so we express the result in terms of these variables.

The other variables (`total`, `i`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `count`, and the elements of `store`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is \(2(k - 1)\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `count` is \(k\), and the value printed is \(rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)\).**
