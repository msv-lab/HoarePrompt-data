`store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends a list containing `i + 1` and `j + 1` to the `store` list. The value of `j` must be in the range `[0, cols - 1]`, but the values of `i` and `store` are not specified in the initial state, so they remain unchanged. After executing the code, the `store` list will contain one additional element, which is `[i + 1, j + 1]`.

Output State: **`j` is in the range `[0, cols - 1]`; `store` contains the element `[i + 1, j + 1]`**
