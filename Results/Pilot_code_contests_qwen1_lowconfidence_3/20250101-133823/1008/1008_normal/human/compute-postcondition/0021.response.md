Postcondition: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is either 0 or 1, `store` is a list containing all pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for each iteration where \(j\) starts from `cols - 1` and decrements to 0, and `i` remains 0. If `not turn`, `j` is set to `cols - 1` and `store` is initialized as a list of pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for all `j` in the range `[0, cols - 1]`. Otherwise, `turn` is set to 1 and `store` is constructed by iterating over `j` from `cols - 1` to 0.**
