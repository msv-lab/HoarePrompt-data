According to the code, the loop runs as long as `j` is less than `cols`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is less than `cols`, and `store` contains an additional element `[i + 1, j + 1]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and it needs to remain less than `cols`. Therefore, `j` will be `j + 1`, and we need to ensure that this new value of `j` is still less than `cols`.

Since `store` already contains an additional element, it doesn't change the condition for the loop to continue.

State: **`j` is less than `cols` and equals `j + 1`, `store` contains an additional element `[i + 1, j + 1]`**
