The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on certain conditions related to the parameters `rows`, `cols`, and `k`, but since these parameters are not part of the function definition, they must be considered external inputs.

Given the constraints:
- `rows` and `cols` are positive integers such that `2 <= rows, cols <= 300`.
- `k` is a positive integer such that `2 * k <= rows * cols`.

Since the function definition does not include these parameters, we can only describe its output behavior in terms of the constraints provided.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on the constraints that rows and cols are positive integers within the range [2, 300] and k is a positive integer such that 2 * k <= rows * cols.**
