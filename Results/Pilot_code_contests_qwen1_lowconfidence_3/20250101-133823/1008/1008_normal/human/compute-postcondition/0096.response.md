The code prints the elements at index `i` of the list `store`, separated by spaces, using `end=' '` in `print`. This does not change the values of any variables but modifies the output when the print statement is executed. The list `store` and the index `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`store` is a list with at least one element, `i` is an index within the list `store` and `i` must be less than `rows * cols - 1`, a value is printed corresponding to `store[i]`**
