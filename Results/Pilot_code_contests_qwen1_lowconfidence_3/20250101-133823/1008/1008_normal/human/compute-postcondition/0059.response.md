Output State: **`turn` is the opposite of its initial value, `store` contains all pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every combination of `i` and `j` where `i` ranges from 0 to `rows-1` and `j` ranges from `cols-1` to 0 if `turn` was initially 0, or from 0 to `cols-1` if `turn` was initially 1, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\).**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution:**
   - The outer loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = rows - 1`.
   - For each `i`, the inner loop runs in reverse order for even `turn` and forward for odd `turn`.
   - This means that the sequence of appending pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) to `store` covers all cells in the grid exactly once.

2. **Final State:**
   - Since the loop runs exactly `rows` times, and within each iteration, it covers all columns in either forward or reverse order, `store` will contain all pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every cell in the grid.
   - The `turn` variable toggles between `True` and `False` after each iteration, so it will be the opposite of its initial value after `rows` iterations.
   - `curr_x` and `curr_y` remain at their initial values of 0 because they are not modified within the loop.
   - `rows`, `cols`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

3. **Edge Case:**
   - If the loop does not execute (which is not possible given the constraints), the values of `curr_x`, `curr_y`, and `turn` would still be 0, 0, and the initial value, respectively. However, since the loop must run at least once due to the constraints (`2 <= rows, cols`), this scenario does not apply.
