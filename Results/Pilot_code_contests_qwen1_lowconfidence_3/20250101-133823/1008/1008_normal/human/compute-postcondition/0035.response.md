`store` is appended with a list containing `[i + 1, j + 1]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `j` is decremented by 1 but must still be greater than 0. Therefore, the new list is added to `store`.

Output State: **`store` contains the updated list `[i + 1, j + 1]`, `i` remains unchanged, and `j` is decremented by 1 but still greater than 0.**
