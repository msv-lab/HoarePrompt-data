The code appends a list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, it is unclear what `i + 1` evaluates to. However, `j` is known to be 0. Therefore, `j + 1` is 1. The state of `j` is not affected by this code, and the condition that `cols` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `cols` must be greater than 0, `store` contains a new element `[i + 1, 1]`**
