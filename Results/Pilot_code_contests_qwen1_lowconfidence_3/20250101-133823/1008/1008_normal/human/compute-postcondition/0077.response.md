The code `print(*store[i + 1])` prints the elements of `store[i + 1]`, which is `store[4]`, separated by a space. The initial state includes that the elements of `store[3]` are printed separated by a space, followed by the number 2. This implies that the elements of `store[3]` have already been printed. The code now will print the elements of `store[4]`.

Given that `i` is 4, the code will print the elements of `store[4]`. Since no specific values for `store[4]` are provided, we assume `store[4]` is an iterable (list or tuple) and its elements will be printed separated by a space.

The states of the other variables (`total`, `i`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `rows`, `cols`, `k`, and `count`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 4, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `count` is 4, and the elements of `store[4]` are printed separated by a space.**
