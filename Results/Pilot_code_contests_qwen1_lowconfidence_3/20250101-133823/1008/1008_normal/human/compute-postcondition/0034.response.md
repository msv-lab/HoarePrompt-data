Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `store` is updated to include the list `[i + 1, j + 1]`.
   - `i` is unchanged.
   - `j` is unchanged.

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `cols - 1` to `0` (inclusive), decrementing `j` by 1 each time (`range(cols - 1, -1, -1)`).

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `j` remains unchanged.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must still be within the specified range (`cols - 1` to 0).

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is unchanged, we don't need to adjust it.
   - We need to adjust `j` such that the loop condition is met. Since the loop decrements `j`, `j` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` must be decremented by 1 (assuming it was within the valid range) and must still be greater than 0.

**Final State:**
- `store` remains the same as it was updated in the previous iteration.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `j` is decremented by 1 and must still be greater than 0.

State: **`store` includes the list `[i + 1, j + 1]`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0**.
