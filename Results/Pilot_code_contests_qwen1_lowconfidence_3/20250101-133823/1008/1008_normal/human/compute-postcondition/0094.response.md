To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < rows * cols`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < rows * cols` must evaluate to `True`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `store` is a list with at least one element.
   - `i` is an index within the list `store`.
   - `i` has been incremented by 1.

3. **Loop Execution Requirement**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `rows * cols` after the increment.

4. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**:
   - Since `i` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.
   - To ensure `i + 1 < rows * cols`, we need `i + 1` to be less than `rows * cols`.
   - Therefore, `i` itself must be less than `rows * cols - 1`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is less than `rows * cols - 1` before the next iteration starts.

Given this reasoning, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` should be less than `rows * cols - 1`.

State: **`store` is a list with at least one element, `i` is an index within the list `store` and `i` must be less than `rows * cols - 1`**
