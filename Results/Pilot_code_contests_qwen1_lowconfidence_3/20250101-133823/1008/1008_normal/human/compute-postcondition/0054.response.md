Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cols` is at least 1.
   - `store` is a list containing at least one element which is `[i + 1, j + 1]` and now also contains `[i + 1, cols - 1]`.
   - `j` is `cols - 2`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` in reverse order from `cols - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. 

3. **Current Values:**
   - `j` is currently `cols - 2`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1 (from `cols - 2` to `cols - 3`).
   - Since `j` is decremented, the new value of `j` will be `cols - 3`.

5. **Other States:**
   - `cols` remains unchanged as it does not depend on `j` within the loop.
   - `store` should still contain all elements it had previously plus the new element `[i + 1, cols - 1]` (since the loop hasn't modified `store` yet).

6. **Adjusted States:**
   - `cols` is at least 1.
   - `store` is a list containing at least one element which is `[i + 1, j + 1]` and now also contains `[i + 1, cols - 1]`, and it will include the new element `[i + 1, cols - 1]` if the loop executes again.
   - `j` is `cols - 3`.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration are:

**State: **`cols` is at least 1; `store` is a list containing at least one element which is `[i + 1, j + 1]` and now also contains `[i + 1, cols - 1]`; `j` is `cols - 3`**
