Output State: **`j` is equal to `cols - 1`, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `cols`, `store` is a list containing elements `[i + 1, j + 1]` for all `j` in the range `[0, cols - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `cols - 1`.
- For each iteration, it appends a new element `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list.
- After the loop completes, `j` will be equal to `cols - 1` because the loop increments `j` from `0` to `cols - 1`.
- The condition `2 <= cols` ensures that the loop runs at least once, so `cols` remains positive and greater than or equal to 2.
- The `store` list will contain all elements `[i + 1, j + 1]` for each `j` in the range `[0, cols - 1]`.

If the loop does not execute (which would be the case if `cols` is less than 2), the values of the variables would remain as follows:
- `j` would still be `0`.
- `cols` would need to be 1 or less, which contradicts the initial state where `2 <= cols`.
- `store` would remain an empty list.
