The code `store = []` initializes an empty list named `store`. This does not affect the values of `rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, or `turn`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `store` list.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that `2 <= rows, cols <= 300`, `cols` is a positive integer such that `2 <= rows, cols <= 300`, `k` is a positive integer such that `2 * k <= rows * cols`, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 0, `store` is an empty list**
