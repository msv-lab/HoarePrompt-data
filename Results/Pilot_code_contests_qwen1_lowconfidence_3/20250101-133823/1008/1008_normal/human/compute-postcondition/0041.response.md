Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is in the range `[cols - 1]` if `turn` was initially 0, otherwise `j` is 0.
   - `turn` is the opposite of its initial value.
   - `store` contains all pairs `[i + 1, j + 1]` for `j` in the range `[cols - 1, 0]`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `curr_x` is 0.
   - `curr_y` is 0.
   - `rows` and `cols` are unchanged.
   - `k` is unchanged.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range `[rows]`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

3. **Next Iteration Conditions:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `rows`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 2, the loop will execute again if `rows` is greater than 2.

4. **Updating the States:**
   - Since the loop will execute again, `i` will increment by 1, making it `i = 3`.
   - All other states remain unchanged as per the problem description.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j`, `turn`, `store`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `rows`, and `cols` remain unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged.

So, the final state for the next iteration is:

State: **`j` is in the range `[cols - 1]` if `turn` was initially 0, otherwise `j` is 0; `turn` is the opposite of its initial value; `store` contains all pairs `[i + 1, j + 1]` for `j` in the range `[cols - 1, 0]`; `i` is 3; `curr_x` is 0; `curr_y` is 0; `rows` and `cols` are unchanged; `k` is unchanged.**
