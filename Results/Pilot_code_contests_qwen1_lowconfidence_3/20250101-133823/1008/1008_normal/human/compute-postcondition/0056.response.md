Output State: **`cols` is at least 1, `store` is a list containing `[i + 1, j + 1]` for each column index from `cols - 1` down to 0, `j` is 0 (or less if `cols` is greater than 1), `i` is 3, `turn` is True, and `k` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the columns in reverse order starting from `cols - 1` down to 0.
- Each iteration appends a new element `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list, where `j` decreases by 1 with each iteration.
- After all iterations, `j` will be 0 (or less if `cols` is greater than 1).
- Since the loop starts from `cols - 1` and decrements `j` until it reaches 0, if `cols` is 1, the loop only runs once and `j` will be 0. If `cols` is greater than 1, the loop will run `cols` times, and `j` will be 0 after the last iteration.
- The other variables (`i`, `turn`, `store`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `rows`, and `k`) remain unchanged throughout the loop.
