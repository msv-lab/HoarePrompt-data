The code `print(*store[i], end=' ')` prints the elements of `store[i]` separated by a space. Since the initial state shows that the elements of `store[3]` are printed, it means `i` is 3. The elements of `store[3]` are printed, and then 2 is printed followed by a space.

After executing the code, the values of the variables remain unchanged except for the action of printing. The print action does not alter the variables themselves but changes the output state.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 4, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `count` is 4, and the elements of `store[3]` are printed separated by a space, followed by the number 2.**
