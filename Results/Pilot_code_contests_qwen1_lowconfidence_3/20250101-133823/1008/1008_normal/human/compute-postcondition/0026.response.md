Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is in the range `[0, cols - 1]`.
   - `store` contains the element `[i + 1, j + 1]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` in the range `range(cols)`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within the range `[0, cols - 1]` but incremented by 1 from its current value.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `j` is in the range `[0, cols - 1]`, it means `j` can take any value from `0` to `cols - 1`.
   - After the previous iteration, `j` was at some value `k` where `0 â‰¤ k < cols - 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` should be `k + 1` and still within the range `[0, cols - 1]`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - The value of `j` changes to `j + 1`.
   - The element in `store` remains `[i + 1, j + 1]` because the loop variable `j` affects the second part of the tuple in `store`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`j` is in the range `[1, cols]`, `store` contains the element `[i + 1, j + 1]`**.

However, since `j` must remain within the original range `[0, cols - 1]`, the correct state is:

State: **`j` is in the range `[1, cols - 1]`, `store` contains the element `[i + 1, j + 1]`**.
