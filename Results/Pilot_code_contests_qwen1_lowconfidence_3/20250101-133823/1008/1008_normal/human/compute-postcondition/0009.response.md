`store` appends a new list `[i + 1, j + 1]`. Since `j` is initially 1, `j + 1` equals 2. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains as `i + 1`. Therefore, the new element appended to `store` is `[i + 1, 2]`.

Output State: **`j` is 1; `cols` must be greater than 0; `store` contains new elements `[i + 1, 1]` and `[i + 1, 2]`**
