`i` is incremented by 2. The initial value of `i` is 2, so after incrementing, `i` becomes 4. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 4, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `count` is 3, and the elements of `store[3]` are printed separated by a space.**
