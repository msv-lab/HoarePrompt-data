The code appends the list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Since `store` originally contained the element `[i + 1, j + 1]`, after the append operation, `store` will contain two elements: the original one and the newly appended one. The values of `j` and the expression `[i + 1, j + 1]` remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`j` is in the range `[1, cols - 1]`, `store` contains the elements `[i + 1, j + 1]` and `[i + 1, j + 1]`**
