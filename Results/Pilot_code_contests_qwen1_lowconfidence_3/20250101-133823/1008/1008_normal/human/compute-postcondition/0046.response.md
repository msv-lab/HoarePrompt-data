According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `cols`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `cols`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `cols` and equals `j + 1`. This means that after the last iteration, `j` was just incremented by 1 and is now equal to `cols`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `cols`. Since `j` is already equal to `cols`, it cannot satisfy the condition `j < cols` and thus the loop will not execute again.

However, based on the problem's requirement to provide the state adjustments, we can consider what would be needed if the loop were to execute one more time hypothetically (even though it won't).

Step-by-step:
1. `j` needs to be less than `cols`.
2. After the hypothetical next iteration, `j` would be incremented by 1, making it `j + 1`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time hypothetically:
- `j` should be `cols - 1` at the start of the next iteration, and it would then increment to `cols` during the next iteration, satisfying the condition `j < cols`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (hypothetically) would be:

State: **`j` is `cols - 1`, `store` contains an additional element `[i + 1, j + 1]` and an extra element `[i + 1, j + 1]` appended to it**
