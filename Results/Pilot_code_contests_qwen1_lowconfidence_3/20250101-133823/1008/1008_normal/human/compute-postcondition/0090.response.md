The code `print(*store[i])` prints the elements of the list `store` at index `i`. However, since the initial values of `store` and `i` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact output. But we can say that the elements at index `i` in the list `store` are printed.

Output State: **`store` is a list with at least one element; `i` is an index within the list `store`; elements at index `i` in `store` are printed**
