Functionality: **The function generates and prints a sequence of pairs representing coordinates in a grid of size `rows` by `cols`. It first creates a list of all coordinate pairs in a zigzag pattern starting from `(1, 1)` and ending at `(rows, cols)`. Then, it prints the first `2 * (k - 1)` pairs followed by the remaining pairs in order. If the total number of pairs is less than `2 * k`, it prints the last pair without a trailing space. The function returns nothing. Potential edge cases include when `k` is 1 or when `rows * cols` is less than `2 * k`. In these cases, only the last few pairs might be printed.**

- The function accepts three parameters: `rows`, `cols`, and `k`, all of which are positive integers with the constraint that `2 <= rows, cols <= 300` and `2 * k <= rows * cols`.
- The function does not return any value; it prints the sequence of pairs directly.
- After the function concludes, the state of the program is as follows: the specified sequence of pairs has been printed, and the program has ended.
