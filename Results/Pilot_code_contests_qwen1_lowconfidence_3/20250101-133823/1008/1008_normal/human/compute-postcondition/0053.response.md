The code appends a new list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Since `j` is `cols - 2`, the appended list will be `[i + 1, cols - 1]`. The values of `cols` and `store` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cols` is at least 1; `store` is a list containing at least one element which is `[i + 1, j + 1]` and now also contains `[i + 1, cols - 1]`; `j` is `cols - 2`**
