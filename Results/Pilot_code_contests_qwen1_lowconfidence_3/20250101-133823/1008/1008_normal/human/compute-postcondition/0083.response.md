Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `i` is equal to `rows * cols - 1`, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `count` is \(k\), and the value printed is \(rows \times cols - 2 \times (k - 1)\)**
