Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\)
   - `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\)
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\)
   - `curr_x` is 0
   - `curr_y` is 0
   - `turn` is 1
   - `store` is `[1, 1]`
   - `i` is 0

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for j in range(cols - 1, -1, -1):`. This means the loop starts from `cols - 1` and decrements `j` by 1 until `j` becomes -1.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - Since `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the loop has just started with `j` set to `cols - 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be decremented by 1 from `cols - 1`.
   - Therefore, `j` will become `cols - 2`.
   - All other variables (`total`, `rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `turn`, and `store`) remain unchanged because they are not involved in the loop condition or the loop body.

5. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - `total` remains 0.
   - `rows` remains the same.
   - `cols` remains the same.
   - `k` remains the same.
   - `curr_x` remains 0.
   - `curr_y` remains 0.
   - `turn` remains 1.
   - `store` remains `[1, 1]`.
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `j` becomes `cols - 2`.

**State:**
**`total` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 1, `store` is `[1, 1]`, `i` is 0, `j` is `cols - 2`**
