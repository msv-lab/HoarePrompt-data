The code `turn ^= 1` toggles the value of `turn` between 0 and 1. Given the initial conditions, if `turn` was initially 0, it will become 1, and if it was initially 1, it will become 0. The values of the other variables (`j`, `store`, `i`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `rows`, `cols`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

If `turn` was initially 0, then `j` was in the range `[cols - 1]`. After the operation, `turn` becomes 1, so `j` will now be in the range `[0]`.

If `turn` was initially 1, then `j` was 0. After the operation, `turn` becomes 0, so `j` will now be in the range `[cols - 1]`.

Since the exact initial value of `turn` is not specified, we consider both cases:

- If `turn` was initially 0, then `j` is in the range `[cols - 1]` and `turn` is now 1.
- If `turn` was initially 1, then `j` is 0 and `turn` is now 0.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`j` is in the range `[cols - 1]` if `turn` was initially 0, otherwise `j` is 0; `turn` is the opposite of its initial value; `store` contains all pairs `[i + 1, j + 1]` for `j` in the range `[cols - 1, 0]`; `i` is 2; `curr_x` is 0; `curr_y` is 0; `rows` and `cols` are unchanged; `k` is unchanged.**
