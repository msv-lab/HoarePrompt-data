The code snippet `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends a new list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the list `store`. However, since the initial state does not specify the values of `i` and `j`, and there are no values given for `store`, we can only state that `store` now includes this new list. The variables `i` and `j` retain their original values.

Output State: **`store` is a list containing `[i + 1, j + 1]`; `i` is its original value; `j` is its original value**
