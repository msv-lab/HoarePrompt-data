The code `print(*store[i], end=' ')` does not affect any variables in the initial state. It simply prints the elements of the list `store[i]` separated by a space without a newline at the end. Since no new values are assigned or variables are modified, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `count` must be 1, and the elements of `store[0]` are printed separated by a space.**
