Output State: **`j` is in the range `[cols - 1]`, `store` contains `cols` elements of the form `[i + 1, j + 1]` where `j` ranges from `0` to `cols - 1`.**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initial Values and Loop Code**:
   - `turn` is initially either 0 or 1.
   - `store` is initialized based on `turn`: if `turn` is 0, `store` contains pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for \(j\) in \([0, cols - 1]\); if `turn` is 1, `store` contains pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for \(j\) in \([cols - 1, 0]\).
   - `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\).
   - `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\).
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\).
   - `curr_x` is 0.
   - `curr_y` is 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - The loop runs for each `j` in the range \([0, cols - 1]\).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration of the loop, the code appends a new pair \([i + 1, j + 1]\) to `store`.
   - Since the loop runs `cols` times (once for each `j` in the range \([0, cols - 1]\)), `store` will contain exactly `cols` elements.

3. **Final Values After Loop Execution**:
   - After the loop completes, `j` will have taken on every value in the range \([0, cols - 1]\), so `j` is in the range \([cols - 1]\).
   - `store` will contain `cols` elements of the form \([i + 1, j + 1]\) where `j` ranges from `0` to `cols - 1`.

4. **Non-Execution Case**:
   - If the loop does not execute (which would only happen if the range is empty, i.e., `cols` is 0, but this contradicts the condition \(2 \leq \text{cols}\)), the values of `j`, `store`, `i`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `rows`, and `cols` would remain as they were initially set.

Thus, the final output state is that `j` is in the range \([cols - 1]\) and `store` contains `cols` elements of the form \([i + 1, j + 1]\).
