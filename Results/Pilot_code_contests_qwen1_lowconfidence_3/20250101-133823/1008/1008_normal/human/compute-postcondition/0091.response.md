The given code snippet is `print(*store[i], end=' ')`. This line of code does not assign any new values to variables; instead, it prints elements from the list `store` starting at index `i` using the unpacking operator `*`, and it ends the print statement with a space.

Since no variables are being updated or assigned new values, the only impact is the printing action, which is not included in the final state. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`store` is as defined in the initial state, `i` is as defined in the initial state**
