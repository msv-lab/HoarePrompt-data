Let's break down the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration**: 
  - `store` is a list containing `[i + 1, j + 1]`
  - `i` is its original value
  - `j` is its original value

- **For Loop Statement**:
  ```python
  for j in range(cols - 1, -1, -1):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Range Function**:
   - The `range(cols - 1, -1, -1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from `cols - 1` and decrementing by 1 until it reaches `-1`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - Let's assume the initial value of `j` is `j_start` (its original value).

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - In each iteration, `j` is decremented by 1.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have been decremented once compared to its original value.

4. **Determine the New Value of `j`**:
   - If the original value of `j` was `j_start`, then at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would now be `j_start - 1`.

5. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be greater than `-1`, i.e., `j` must be `-1` or greater.

6. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `store` remains unchanged since the loop body is omitted.
   - `i` remains unchanged since the loop only modifies `j`.
   - `j` needs to be `j_start - 1` for the loop to continue.

### Final State Adjustment:

State: **`store` is a list containing `[i + 1, j + 1]`, `i` is its original value, `j` is `j_start - 1`**
