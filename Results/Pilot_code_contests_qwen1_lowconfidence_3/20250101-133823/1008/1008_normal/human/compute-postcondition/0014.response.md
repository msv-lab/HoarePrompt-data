To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\).
- `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\).
- `curr_x` is 0.
- `curr_y` is 0.
- `turn` is 1.
- `store` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(cols - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop iterates over the range `range(cols - 1, -1, -1)`, which means `j` will take values from `cols - 1` down to 0 in steps of -1.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute, `cols - 1` should be a valid starting point, meaning `cols` must be at least 1 (but since `cols` is specified as \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), this condition is already met).

2. **Other Variables:**
   - The other variables (`rows`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `turn`, `store`, and `i`) do not directly affect the loop's execution based on the given loop statement.

### Conclusion:

The only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is ensuring that `cols` is at least 1, but since it is already specified that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), no further adjustments are necessary for `cols`.

Therefore, the required state for the loop to execute is simply the initial values of the variables without any additional modifications needed.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 1, `store` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is initialized to `cols - 1`**.

However, since the specific value of `j` does not need to be explicitly mentioned as it will be set by the loop itself, the essential states remain the same as given initially.

Thus, the final answer is:
State: **`total` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 1, `store` is an empty list, `i` is 0**.
