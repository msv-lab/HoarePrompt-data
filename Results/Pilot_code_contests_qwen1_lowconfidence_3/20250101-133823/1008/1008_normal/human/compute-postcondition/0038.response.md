Let's analyze the loop step by step and deduce the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Initial State:
- `turn` is 0.
- `store` is a list of pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for all `j` in the range `[0, cols - 1]`.
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\).
- `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\).
- `curr_x` is 0.
- `curr_y` is 0.
- `i` is 2.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(cols - 1, -1, -1):
    store.append([i + 1, j + 1])
```

### Observations from Given Output States:
- After 1 iteration: `store` is updated to include the list `[i + 1, j + 1]`, `i` remains unchanged, and `j` is unchanged.
- After 2 iterations: `store` contains the updated list `[i + 1, j + 1]`, `i` remains unchanged, and `j` is decremented by 1 but still greater than 0.
- After 3 iterations: `store` contains `[i + 1, j]` and `[i + 1, j + 1]`, `i` remains unchanged, and `j` is decremented by 1 but still greater than 0.

### Deduction:
1. **`store`**: The loop appends a new pair \([i + 1, j + 1]\) to `store` for each `j` in the range `[cols - 1, 0]`. Since the loop runs for `cols` times (once for each `j`), `store` will end up containing all pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for `j` in the range `[cols - 1, 0]`.

2. **`i`**: `i` remains unchanged because the loop body does not modify `i`.

3. **`j`**: `j` starts at `cols - 1` and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. Therefore, after the loop, `j` will be 0.

4. **`curr_x` and `curr_y`**: These variables are not modified within the loop and remain at their initial values of 0.

5. **`rows` and `cols`**: These variables are not modified within the loop and remain at their initial values.

6. **`k`**: This variable is not modified within the loop and remains at its initial value.

### Final Output State:
- `store` will contain all pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for `j` in the range `[cols - 1, 0]`.
- `i` remains unchanged and is 2.
- `j` becomes 0.
- `curr_x` and `curr_y` remain 0.
- `rows` and `cols` remain unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:
**Output State:**
- `store` is a list containing all pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for `j` in the range `[cols - 1, 0]`.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 0.
- `curr_x` is 0.
- `curr_y` is 0.
- `rows` and `cols` are unchanged.
- `k` is unchanged.

Output State: **`store` is a list containing all pairs \([2, j + 1]\) for `j` in the range `[cols - 1, 0]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` and `cols` are unchanged, `k` is unchanged.**
