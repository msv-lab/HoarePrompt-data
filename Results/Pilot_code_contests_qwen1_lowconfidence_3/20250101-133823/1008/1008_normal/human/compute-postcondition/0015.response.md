The code appends a list containing `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Since `i` is currently 0 and `j` is not mentioned in the initial state, it's assumed to be 0 as well (since no other value is given). Thus, the list being appended is `[0 + 1, 0 + 1]`, which simplifies to `[1, 1]`.

The `store` list was initially empty, so after appending `[1, 1]`, it now contains `[1, 1]`.

The values of the other variables (`total`, `rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `turn`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 1, `store` is `[1, 1]`, `i` is 0**
