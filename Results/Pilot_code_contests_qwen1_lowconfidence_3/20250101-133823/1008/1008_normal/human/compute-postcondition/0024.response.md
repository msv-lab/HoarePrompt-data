According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `j`. For the loop to execute, `j` must be within the specified range, which is defined by the variable `cols`. Specifically, the loop will iterate over each value of `j` in the range from `0` to `cols - 1`.

Let's break down the initial state and identify what needs to be adjusted:

1. **Initial Values**: The initial values given are:
   - `turn` is 1 if initially 0, otherwise 0.
   - `store` is a list of pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for all `j` in the range `[0, cols - 1]` if `turn` was initially 0, otherwise a list of pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for all `j` in the range `[cols - 1, 0]`.
   - `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\).
   - `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\).
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\).
   - `curr_x` is 0.
   - `curr_y` is 0.
   - `i` is 2.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will run for each `j` in the range from `0` to `cols - 1`.

Since the loop itself does not depend on `turn`, `store`, `rows`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, or `i`, these do not need to be adjusted. The only condition that must be met for the loop to execute is that `j` should be in the range `[0, cols - 1]`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is simply ensuring that `j` is in the range `[0, cols - 1]`.

State: **`j` must be in the range `[0, cols - 1]`**
