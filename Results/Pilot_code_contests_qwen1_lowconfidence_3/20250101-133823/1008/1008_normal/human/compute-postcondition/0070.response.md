The code `print(*store[i], end=' ')` prints the elements of `store[i]` separated by a space. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so this will print the elements of `store[2]`. However, since `store[1]` is the only part of `store` that is mentioned in the initial state and no changes are made to `store` within the given code snippet, `store[2]` is not defined.

Since `store[2]` is not defined, the code will raise an error when executed. But if we assume that the question is asking about the state after attempting to execute the line of code (which implies that the error is handled or ignored for the sake of this exercise), the only change is that `store[2]` would be accessed, even though its elements are not specified.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `count` is 3, and the elements of `store[2]` are accessed (or attempted to be printed) separated by a space.**
