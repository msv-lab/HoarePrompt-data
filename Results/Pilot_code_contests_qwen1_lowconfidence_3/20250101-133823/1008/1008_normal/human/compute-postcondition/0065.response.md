The code `print(*store[i + 1])` prints the elements of `store[i + 1]`. Given the initial state:

- `total` is 0
- `i` is 0
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\)
- `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\)
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\)
- `count` is 1
- The elements of `store[0]` are printed separated by a space

Since the code is printing `store[i + 1]`, we need to determine the value of `i + 1`, which is `0 + 1 = 1`. So, the code will print the elements of `store[1]`.

After this operation, the variables `total`, `i`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `rows`, `cols`, `k`, and `count` remain unchanged. The elements of `store[1]` will be printed.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `count` is 1, and the elements of `store[1]` are printed separated by a space.**
