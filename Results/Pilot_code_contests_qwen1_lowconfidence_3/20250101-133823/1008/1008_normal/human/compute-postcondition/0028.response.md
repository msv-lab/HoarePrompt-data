Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `j` is within the range `[1, cols - 1]`, and `store` contains the elements `[i + 1, j + 1]` and `[i + 1, j + 1]`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over `j` in the range `range(cols)`. This means `j` starts from `0` and goes up to `cols - 1`.

3. **Current Iteration Analysis**:
   - Since `j` is currently in the range `[1, cols - 1]`, the current value of `j` is `cols - 1` (because it includes `cols - 1`).
   - The loop condition `j < cols` must hold true for the loop to continue.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to increment to `cols`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `cols`.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - The variable `j` must be `cols`.
   - The value of `store` remains unchanged as the loop body is omitted and no modifications are mentioned.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is `cols`, `store` contains the elements `[i + 1, j + 1]` and `[i + 1, j + 1]`**
