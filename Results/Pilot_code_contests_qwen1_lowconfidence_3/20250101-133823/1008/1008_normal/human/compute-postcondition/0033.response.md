The code `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends a new list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the list `store`. Since the initial values of `i` and `j` are not specified, we can denote them generically. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `store` list is modified by appending a new list `[i + 1, j + 1]`.
2. The values of `i` and `j` are used to create the new list, which is added to `store`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`store` is updated to include the list `[i + 1, j + 1]`, `i` is unchanged, and `j` is unchanged.**
