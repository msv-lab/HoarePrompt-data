`turn` is toggled using the `^=` operator, which flips the value of `turn`. Initially, `turn` is `True`. Toggling `True` results in `False`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `store` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 0 (or less if `cols` is greater than 1), `turn` is False, `k` remains unchanged, and `store` is a list containing `[i + 1, j + 1]` for each column index from `cols - 1` down to 0 if `not turn` is true, or a list containing `cols` elements of the form `[i + 1, j + 1]` if `not turn` is false.**
