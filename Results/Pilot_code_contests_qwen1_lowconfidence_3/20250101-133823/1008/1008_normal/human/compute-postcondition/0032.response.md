Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop variable is `j`, which is initialized in the `range(cols - 1, -1, -1)` expression.
   - This means `j` will take values from `cols - 1` down to `0`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `j`:**
   - According to the `range` function, the initial value of `j` is `cols - 1`.
   - Therefore, before the loop starts, `j` should be set to `cols - 1`.

3. **Check Other Relevant Variables:**
   - The other variables (`turn`, `store`, `rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, and `i`) are not directly involved in the loop condition but might be affected by the loop or are part of the program state.
   - Since the loop only modifies `j`, and there are no assignments to `j` outside the loop, we don't need to adjust these other variables for the loop to start.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `cols` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 (since `range` is inclusive of the start value and exclusive of the stop value).

Based on the above steps, the state needs to be adjusted to include the initial value of `j` and ensure that `cols` is a valid positive integer.

**Final State:**
State: **`turn` is 0, `store` is a list of pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for all `j` in the range `[0, cols - 1]`, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 2, `j` is `cols - 1`**
