`count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` is 1, so after the increment, `count` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `i` is 2, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `count` is 2, and the elements of `store[1]` are printed separated by a space.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `count` is 2, and the elements of `store[1]` are printed separated by a space.**
