According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `cols`. If `j` is less than `cols`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `cols` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `cols` must still be greater than 0.

The `store` list contains new elements `[i + 1, 1]` and `[i + 1, 2]`, but since the loop variable `j` is being incremented and does not directly affect the contents of `store`, we do not need to adjust the contents of `store`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is 2, `cols` must be greater than 0, `store` contains new elements `[i + 1, 1]` and `[i + 1, 2]`**
