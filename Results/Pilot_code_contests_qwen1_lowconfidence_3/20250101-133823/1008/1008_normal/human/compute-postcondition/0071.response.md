The code `print(*store[i + 1])` prints the elements of `store[i + 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `store[i + 1]` refers to `store[3]`. The elements of `store[3]` are accessed (or attempted to be printed) separated by a space. Since no assignment or modification of variables is done in this line of code, only the printing action occurs.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `count` is 3, and the elements of `store[3]` are printed separated by a space.**
