To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the current values of the variables involved.

The loop condition is:
\[ \text{while } i < \text{rows} \times \text{cols}: \]

Given the initial values:
- \( \text{total} = 0 \)
- \( \text{i} = 2(k - 1) \)
- \( \text{curr\_x} = 0 \)
- \( \text{curr\_y} = 0 \)
- \( \text{rows} \) is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq \text{rows} \)
- \( \text{cols} \) is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq \text{cols} \)
- \( \text{k} \) is a positive integer such that \( 2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols} \)
- \( \text{count} = k \)
- The value printed is \( \text{rows} \times \text{cols} - 2 \times (k - 1) \)

We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once, meaning that the condition \( i < \text{rows} \times \text{cols} \) must be true after the adjustment.

Current value of \( i \):
\[ i = 2(k - 1) \]

Value of \( \text{rows} \times \text{cols} \):
\[ \text{rows} \times \text{cols} \]

For the loop to execute one more time, \( i \) must be less than \( \text{rows} \times \text{cols} \). Given \( i = 2(k - 1) \), we need to check if this value is less than \( \text{rows} \times \text{cols} \).

Since \( 2 \leq \text{rows} \) and \( 2 \leq \text{cols} \), the minimum value of \( \text{rows} \times \text{cols} \) is \( 4 \) (when both \( \text{rows} \) and \( \text{cols} \) are 2).

Given \( k \) is a positive integer such that \( 2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols} \), the smallest possible value of \( k \) is 2 (since \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \)).

Thus, the smallest possible value of \( i \) when \( k = 2 \) is:
\[ i = 2(2 - 1) = 2 \]

Since \( 2 < 4 \), the smallest \( i \) (2) is always less than the smallest possible \( \text{rows} \times \text{cols} \) (4).

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed because the loop can already execute based on the given values.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is \(2(k - 1)\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `count` is \(k\), and the value printed is \(rows \times cols - 2 \times (k - 1)\)**.
