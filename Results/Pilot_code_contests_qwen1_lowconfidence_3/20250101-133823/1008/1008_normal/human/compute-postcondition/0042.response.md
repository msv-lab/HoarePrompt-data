According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `cols`. The loop will execute if `j` is within the range defined by `range(cols)`, meaning `j` must be less than `cols`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 3.
- `j`, `turn`, `store`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `rows`, and `cols` remain unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.

Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `j` is within the valid range for the loop to execute. Since `j` starts from 0 (the default start value for `range`), `j` must be less than `cols` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect this requirement.

State: **`j` must be less than `cols`**
