The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is either `2(k - 1)` or `rows * cols - 1`. Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we consider both cases:

1. If `i` was initially `2(k - 1)`, then after incrementing, `i` becomes `2(k - 1) + 1`.
2. If `i` was initially `rows * cols - 1`, then after incrementing, `i` becomes `rows * cols`.

However, the condition `i` is set to `2(k - 1)` if `i` equals `rows * cols - 1` is not relevant here because we are only considering the effect of the `i += 1` operation.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- If `i` was `2(k - 1)`, it becomes `2(k - 1) + 1`.
- If `i` was `rows * cols - 1`, it becomes `rows * cols`.

All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is either `2(k - 1) + 1` or `rows * cols`, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `count` is \(k\), and the value printed is `rows * cols - 2 \times (k - 1)`.
