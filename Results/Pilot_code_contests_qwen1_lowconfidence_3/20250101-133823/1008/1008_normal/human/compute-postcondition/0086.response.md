The code snippet `print(*store[i], end=' ')` does not assign any new value to any variable; instead, it prints the elements of the list stored at index `i` in `store` separated by a space and does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the only change is the output which is the elements of the list at index `i`. However, since no specific list `store` is provided and no new values are assigned, we focus on the variables that remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is \(2(k - 1)\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `count` is \(k\), and the value printed is \(rows \times cols - 2 \times (k - 1)\), and `i` is not equal to \(rows \times cols - 1\).**
