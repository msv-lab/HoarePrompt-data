The code snippet `rows, cols, k = func_1()` assigns the return values of `func_1()` to `rows`, `cols`, and `k`. Since `func_1()` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values it returns. However, we know from the precondition that `rows`, `cols`, and `k` are positive integers such that `2 <= rows, cols <= 300` and `2 * k <= rows * cols`.

Given this, the output state will reflect that `rows`, `cols`, and `k` have been updated by the function `func_1()`, but their exact values are unknown.

Output State: **`rows`, `cols`, and `k` are positive integers such that `2 <= rows, cols <= 300` and `2 * k <= rows * cols`, and they have been updated by `func_1()`.**
