The code initializes two variables `curr_x` and `curr_y` to 0. This does not affect the values of `rows`, `cols`, and `k` which are already defined and updated by `func_1()`.

Output State: **`rows`, `cols`, and `k` are positive integers such that `2 <= rows, cols <= 300` and `2 * k <= rows * cols`, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0**
