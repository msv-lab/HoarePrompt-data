Output State: **`j` is less than `cols`, `store` is a list containing `cols` elements of the form `[i + 1, j + 1]`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `cols - 1`.
- Each iteration appends a new element `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the list `store`.
- After the loop completes, `store` will contain exactly `cols` elements, each being `[i + 1, j + 1]` where `j` ranges from `0` to `cols - 1`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., when `cols` is `0`), then:
- `j` is still `0` (though it never increments).
- `store` remains an empty list.

Thus, the final state after all iterations of the loop have finished is as described above.
