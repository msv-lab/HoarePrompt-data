The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The precondition that `i` is an index within the list `store` and if `i` equals `rows * cols - 1`, the elements at index `i` in `store` are printed remains unchanged. However, since `i` has been incremented, it no longer checks for the condition `i == rows * cols - 1`.

Output State: **`store` is a list with at least one element, `i` is an index within the list `store`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
