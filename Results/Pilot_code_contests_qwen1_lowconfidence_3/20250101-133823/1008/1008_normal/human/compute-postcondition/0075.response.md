The code snippet `print(2, end=' ')` prints the number 2 followed by a space without a newline. This does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 4, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `count` is 4, and the elements of `store[3]` are printed separated by a space. Additionally, the number 2 is printed followed by a space.**
