The code appends a list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the list `store`. However, the initial values of `i` and `store` are not specified in the initial state. We know that `j` must be less than `cols`. The impact on the variables is that `store` will have a new element appended to it, and `j` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is less than `cols`; `store` contains an additional element `[i + 1, j + 1]`**
