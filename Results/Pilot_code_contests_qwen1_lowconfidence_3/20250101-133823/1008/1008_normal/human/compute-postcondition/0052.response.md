According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `cols`. The loop runs in reverse from `cols - 1` down to `-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `cols` is at least 1, and `store` is a list containing at least one element which is `[i + 1, j + 1]`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. **Determine the current value of `j`:**
   - Since the loop iterates in reverse, if `j` was `cols - 1` at the start of the first iteration, it would decrement by 1 each time.
   - Let's assume `j` started at `cols - 1` and decreased by 1 at each iteration.

2. **Identify the condition for the loop to continue:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0.

3. **Adjust the state:**
   - After the last iteration, `j` must have been decremented by 1 from its initial value.
   - Therefore, if `j` started at `cols - 1`, it would now be `cols - 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be greater than or equal to 0.

Given this reasoning, the new state at the start of the next iteration should reflect `j` being decremented by 1 and still meeting the loop's condition.

State: **`cols` is at least 1; `store` is a list containing at least one element which is `[i + 1, j + 1]`, `j` is `cols - 2`**
