The code appends a new list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Given the initial state, `j` is 2, so `j + 1` is 3. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so we'll denote it as `i`. Therefore, the new element appended to `store` is `[i + 1, 3]`.

The initial state includes that `store` contains new elements `[i + 1, 1]` and `[i + 1, 2]`. After appending `[i + 1, 3]`, the updated `store` will contain these three elements.

The variables `j` and `cols` are not affected by this operation. The value of `j` remains 2, and `cols` remains greater than 0.

Output State: **`j` is 2; `cols` must be greater than 0; `store` contains elements `[i + 1, 1]`, `[i + 1, 2]`, and `[i + 1, 3]`**
