The code appends the list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Initially, `store` contains the updated list `[i + 1, j]`, and `i` remains unchanged while `j` is decremented by 1 but still greater than 0.

After the execution of `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])`:
- The new list `[i + 1, j + 1]` is appended to `store`.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `j` is decremented by 1 but still greater than 0.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`store` contains `[i + 1, j]` and `[i + 1, j + 1]`, `i` remains unchanged, and `j` is decremented by 1 but still greater than 0.**
