According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `cols`. The loop condition is `j < cols`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `cols` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1. Additionally, `cols` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

State: **`j` is 1, `cols` must be greater than 0, `store` contains a new element `[i + 1, 1]`**
