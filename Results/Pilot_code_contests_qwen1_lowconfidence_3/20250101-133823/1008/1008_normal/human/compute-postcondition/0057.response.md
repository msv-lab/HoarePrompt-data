Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `j` is 0 (or less if `cols` is greater than 1), `turn` is True, `k` remains unchanged, and `store` is a list containing `[i + 1, j + 1]` for each column index from `cols - 1` down to 0 if `not turn` is true, or a list containing `cols` elements of the form `[i + 1, j + 1]` if `not turn` is false.**
