According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` in reverse order from `cols - 1` down to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `store` contains the updated list `[i + 1, j + 1]`, `i` remains unchanged, and `j` is decremented by 1 but still greater than 0.

To determine the new state for the next iteration, we need to follow these steps:

1. Since `j` is decremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be `j - 1`.
2. We need to ensure that `j` is still greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing.
3. The list `store` will be updated to contain the values `[i + 1, j + 1]` with the new value of `j`.

Given the current state:
- `store` contains the updated list `[i + 1, j + 1]`
- `i` remains unchanged
- `j` is decremented by 1 but still greater than 0

For the next iteration:
- `j` will be `j - 1`, which means it will be `j - 1` (since `j` was already decremented by 1 and is still > 0).
- `store` will be updated to `[i + 1, (j - 1) + 1] = [i + 1, j]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`store` contains the updated list `[i + 1, j]`, `i` remains unchanged, and `j` is decremented by 1 but still greater than 0.**
