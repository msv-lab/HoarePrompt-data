The code `turn ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `turn` and 1. This toggles the value of `turn` between 0 and 1. Since the initial value of `turn` is either 0 or 1, after the operation, `turn` will be the opposite value.

Given the initial conditions:
- `turn` is either 0 or 1.
- If `turn` is 0, `store` is a list of pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for all `j` in the range `[0, cols - 1]` when `i` is 0.
- If `turn` is 1, `turn` is set to 1 and `store` is constructed by iterating over `j` from `cols - 1` to 0.

Let's consider both cases:

1. If `turn` is initially 0:
   - `turn` is toggled to 1.
   - `store` remains unchanged (a list of pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for all `j` in the range `[0, cols - 1]`).

2. If `turn` is initially 1:
   - `turn` is toggled to 0.
   - `store` remains unchanged (a list of pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for all `j` in the range `[cols - 1, 0]`).

In both cases, the other variables (`rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `turn` is the opposite of its initial value.
- `store` remains the same as its initial state based on the value of `turn`.

Output State: **`turn` is 1 if initially 0, otherwise 0; `store` is a list of pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for all `j` in the range `[0, cols - 1]` if `turn` was initially 0, otherwise a list of pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for all `j` in the range `[cols - 1, 0]`; `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0.**
