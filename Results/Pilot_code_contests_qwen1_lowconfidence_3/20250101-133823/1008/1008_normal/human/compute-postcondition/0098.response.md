`i` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` was originally an index within the list `store` and is now one more than its original value. The states of the other variables and the precondition of `store` having at least one element and `i` being less than `rows * cols - 1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`store` is a list with at least one element, and `i` is an index within the list `store` and `i` is now `i + 1`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
