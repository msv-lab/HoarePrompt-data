Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `rows * cols`, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `count` is \(k\), and the value printed is `rows * cols - 2 \times (k - 1)`**

Explanation:
1. The loop continues as long as `i < rows * cols`.
2. The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
3. The loop will continue until `i` reaches `rows * cols`, at which point the condition `i < rows * cols` becomes false and the loop terminates.
4. Given that `i` starts at `2(k - 1)` and increments by 1 each time, the loop will execute exactly `rows * cols - 2(k - 1)` times.
5. After the loop executes `rows * cols - 2(k - 1)` times, `i` will be equal to `rows * cols`.
6. All other variables (`total`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `rows`, `cols`, `k`, `count`) remain unchanged throughout the loop.

Thus, after the loop completes, `i` will be `rows * cols`, and all other variables retain their initial values except for the fact that `i` is now at the end of the range `0` to `rows * cols - 1`.
