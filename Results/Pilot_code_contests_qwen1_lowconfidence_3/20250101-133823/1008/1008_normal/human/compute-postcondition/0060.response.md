The code `i = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `i`. This assignment does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `i` and retains the values of the other variables as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`turn` is the opposite of its initial value, `store` contains all pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every combination of `i` and `j` where `i` ranges from 0 to `rows-1` and `j` ranges from `cols-1` to 0 if `turn` was initially 0, or from 0 to `cols-1` if `turn` was initially 1, `i` is 0, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\).**
