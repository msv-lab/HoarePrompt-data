Let's think through this step by step:

1. The loop is defined as `for j in range(cols - 1, -1, -1):`, which means it will iterate over values of `j` starting from `cols - 1` down to 0 (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.

2. For the loop to execute, the range `range(cols - 1, -1, -1)` must contain at least one value. This implies that `cols - 1` should be greater than or equal to 0, meaning `cols` should be at least 1.

3. The initial state of `i` is given as 3, but `i` is not involved in the loop, so its value does not affect the loop execution.

4. Variables `j`, `turn`, `store`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `rows`, and `cols` are mentioned as remaining unchanged, but their values themselves do not affect the loop's ability to start unless they are part of the loop condition. Since `j` is the iterating variable, its initial value within the specified range is crucial.

5. Variable `k` remains unchanged, and `turn` being True or False does not directly affect the loop's execution as long as the loop condition is met.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the range for `j` contains at least one value, which means `cols` must be at least 1. 

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`cols` must be at least 1**
