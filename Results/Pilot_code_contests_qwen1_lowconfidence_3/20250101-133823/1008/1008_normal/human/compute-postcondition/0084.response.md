The code `print(*store[i])` prints the elements of the list stored at index `i` of the `store` list using the unpacking operator. However, the initial state does not include the definition of the `store` list. Without knowing the contents of `store`, we cannot determine what exactly will be printed. The values of other variables like `total`, `i`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `rows`, `cols`, `k`, and `count` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is equal to `rows * cols - 1`, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `count` is \(k\), and the value printed is \(rows \times cols - 2 \times (k - 1)\); the elements of `store[i]` are printed.**
