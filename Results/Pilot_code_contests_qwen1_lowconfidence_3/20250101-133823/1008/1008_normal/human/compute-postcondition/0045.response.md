The code appends a new list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Given the initial state where `j` is less than `cols` and equals `j + 1`, and `store` contains an additional element `[i + 1, j + 1]`, the value of `j` does not change within the context of this operation. However, the `store` list now includes an additional element `[i + 1, j + 1]`.

Output State: **`j` is less than `cols` and equals `j + 1`, `store` contains an additional element `[i + 1, j + 1]` and an extra element `[i + 1, j + 1]` appended to it**
