According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `cols`. The loop will execute if `j` is within the range defined by `range(cols)`, meaning `j` should be between 0 (inclusive) and `cols` (exclusive).

Let's break down the initial states and identify what needs to be adjusted:

- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 <= rows.
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 <= cols.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 * k <= rows * cols.
- `curr_x` is 0.
- `curr_y` is 0.
- `turn` is 0.
- `store` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.
- `not turn` is True.

The loop itself iterates over `j` from 0 to `cols - 1`. Therefore, the initial value of `j` does not matter as long as it can eventually iterate through all values from 0 to `cols - 1`.

Since the loop condition depends on `j` being within the range `range(cols)`, we need to ensure that `cols` is greater than 0 and `j` starts at 0 and increments until it reaches `cols`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` must start at 0.
- `cols` must be greater than 0.

Given these conditions, the states after adjustment would be:
- `j` is 0.
- `cols` must be greater than 0.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:
State: **`j` is 0, `cols` must be greater than 0**
