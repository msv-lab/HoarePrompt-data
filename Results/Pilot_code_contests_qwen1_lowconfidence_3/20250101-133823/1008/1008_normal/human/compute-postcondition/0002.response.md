The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `turn`. The initial values of `rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, and `curr_y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is the assignment to `turn`.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that `2 <= rows, cols <= 300`, `cols` is a positive integer such that `2 <= rows, cols <= 300`, `k` is a positive integer such that `2 * k <= rows * cols`, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 0**
