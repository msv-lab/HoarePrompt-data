Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial State Before the Loop
- `turn` is the opposite of its initial value.
- `store` contains all pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every combination of `i` and `j` where `i` ranges from 0 to `rows-1` and `j` ranges from `cols-1` to 0 if `turn` was initially 0, or from 0 to `cols-1` if `turn` was initially 1.
- `i` is 0.
- `curr_x` is 0.
- `curr_y` is 0.
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\).
- `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\).
- `count` is 0.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```
while count < k - 1:
```

### Analysis
For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `count < k - 1` must be true. Currently, `count` is 0, so the condition `0 < k - 1` must hold, which means `k` must be at least 2. Since this is already given as part of the initial state (`k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\)), no adjustments are necessary for `k`.

However, we need to consider the other variables involved in the loop logic, but the only thing that directly impacts the loop execution based on the given condition is `count`.

### Conclusion
Since `count` is 0 and needs to be incremented to 1 for the loop to execute one more time, and given the condition `count < k - 1` must hold, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `count` itself.

### Final Answer
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), and `count` must be 1**
