The code appends the list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the existing list `store`. Since `store` initially contains `[i + 1, j + 1]`, appending the same list again does not add anything new because lists in Python are references to objects, and appending a reference to the same object does not create a new entry. However, to be precise, we can say that `store` now contains two references to the same list.

The variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`store` is a list containing two references to `[i + 1, j + 1]`, `i` is its original value, `j` is `j_start - 1`**
