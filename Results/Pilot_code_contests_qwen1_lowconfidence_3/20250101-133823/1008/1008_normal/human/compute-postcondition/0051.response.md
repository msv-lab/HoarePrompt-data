`store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends a list containing `i + 1` and `j + 1` to the `store` list. The values of `i` and `j` are not specified in the initial state, so they remain unspecified. However, the `store` list now contains the appended list. 

Output State: **`cols` is at least 1; `store` is a list containing at least one element which is `[i + 1, j + 1]`**
