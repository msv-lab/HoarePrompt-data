Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 1, `store` is a list containing all pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for each iteration where \(j\) starts from `cols - 1` and decrements to 0, `i` remains 0.**

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: The loop initializes with `i = 0` and `j` starting from `cols - 1` and decrementing to 0.
- **Loop Execution**:
  - For the first iteration (`j = cols - 1`):
    - `store` becomes `[1, 1]` (since `i = 0` and `j = cols - 1`).
  - For the second iteration (`j = cols - 2`):
    - `store` becomes `[1, 1], [2, 1]`.
  - This process continues until `j` reaches 0.
- **Final State**:
  - After the loop completes, `store` will contain all pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for each `j` from `cols - 1` to 0.
  - Since `i` remains 0 throughout the loop, the pairs will be \([1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3], ..., [1, cols]\).

Since the loop runs `cols` times and `i` does not change, the final value of `store` will be a list of all possible coordinates in the first row of a grid with dimensions `rows x cols`.
