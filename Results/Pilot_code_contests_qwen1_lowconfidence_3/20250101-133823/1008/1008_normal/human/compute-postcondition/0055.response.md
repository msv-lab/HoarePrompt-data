`store` is a list that initially contains at least one element `[i + 1, j + 1]` and now also contains `[i + 1, cols - 1]`. The code appends a new element `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Given that `j` is `cols - 3`, we can express `j + 1` as `cols - 2`.

The updated `store` list will contain the elements: `[i + 1, j + 1]`, `[i + 1, cols - 1]`, and `[i + 1, cols - 2]`.

Output State: **`cols` is at least 1; `store` is a list containing [i + 1, j + 1], [i + 1, cols - 1], and [i + 1, cols - 2]; `j` is cols - 3**
