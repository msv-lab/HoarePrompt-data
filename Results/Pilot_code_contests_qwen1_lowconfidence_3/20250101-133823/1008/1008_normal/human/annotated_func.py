#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_1` are defined or passed as parameters. The function reads input from standard input (stdin) and returns a tuple of three integers representing the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the number of tubes (k) respectively.
def func_1():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
    #The program returns a tuple of three integers (n, m, k) where n represents the number of rows, m represents the number of columns, and k represents the number of tubes, obtained by reading a line of input from standard input, stripping any trailing whitespace, and splitting the line into three integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin). It then strips any trailing whitespace from this line and splits it into three integers, which represent the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the number of tubes (k). The function returns a tuple containing these three integers. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the input line does not contain exactly three integers separated by whitespace, or if the input line is empty. In such cases, the function still performs the same operations but expects the input to conform to the specified format.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters. It reads input from standard input, which consists of three space-separated integers representing the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the number of tubes (k) respectively, where 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 300 and 2 ≤ 2k ≤ n·m.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
    #The program returns a list of three integers read from standard input, representing the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the number of tubes (k) respectively, where 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 300 and 2 ≤ 2k ≤ n·m
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three space-separated integers from standard input, representing the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the number of tubes (k) respectively. These values are returned as a list. The constraints are 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 300 and 2 ≤ 2k ≤ n·m. The function does not accept any parameters. The function does not perform any additional checks beyond the specified constraints, so it is expected that the user provides valid input within these bounds. If invalid input is provided, the program behavior is undefined.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no information provided about the variables in the function signature for this specific function. The function `func_3` reads a single line from standard input and returns it after stripping any trailing whitespace. However, based on the problem context, we can infer that the function is part of the solution to read the input values for n, m, and k.
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a string after reading a single line from standard input and stripping any trailing whitespace
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and reads a single line from standard input. It then strips any trailing whitespace from the line and returns the resulting string. Potential edge cases include the input being empty (resulting in an empty string) or the input containing only whitespace (also resulting in an empty string). There is no missing functionality as the code accurately performs the described actions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers.
def func_4(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'x' is 0, 'y' is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of 'x' and 'y'
    return x
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. After executing the algorithm, the function returns 0. The state of the program after the function concludes is such that `x` contains the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. However, the function explicitly returns 0 regardless of the computed GCD.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 300 and 2 ≤ 2k ≤ n * m, where n and m are derived from the input and k is the number of tubes to be placed on the table.
def func_5(x, y):
    return x * y // func_4(x, y)
    #`The program returns the integer division of x * y by the result of func_4(x, y)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`, and returns the integer division of their product (`x * y`) by the result of calling another function `func_4(x, y)`. The function assumes that `func_4(x, y)` returns a non-zero value to avoid division by zero errors. If `func_4(x, y)` returns a zero or negative value, the function behavior is undefined because integer division by zero would raise a runtime error. No edge cases or missing functionalities are identified in the provided code.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `turn` is the opposite of its initial value, `store` contains all pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every combination of `i` and `j` where `i` ranges from 0 to `rows-1` and `j` ranges from `cols-1` to 0 if `turn` was initially 0, or from 0 to `cols-1` if `turn` was initially 1, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\).

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `total` is 0, `i` is \(2(k - 1)\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows}\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \times k \leq \text{rows} \times \text{cols}\), `count` is \(k\), and the elements of `store[i // 2]` and `store[(i // 2) + 1]` have been printed.
    print(rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1), end=' ')
    while i < rows * cols:
        if i == rows * cols - 1:
            print(*store[i])
        else:

#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates and prints a sequence of pairs representing coordinates in a grid of size `rows` by `cols`. It first creates a list of all coordinate pairs in a zigzag pattern starting from `(1, 1)` and ending at `(rows, cols)`. Then, it prints the first `2 * (k - 1)` pairs followed by the remaining pairs in order. If the total number of pairs is less than `2 * k`, it prints the last pair without a trailing space. The function returns nothing. Potential edge cases include when `k` is 1 or when `rows * cols` is less than `2 * k`. In these cases, only the last few pairs might be printed.
