The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin). It then strips any trailing whitespace from this line and splits it into three integers, which represent the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the number of tubes (k). The function returns a tuple containing these three integers. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the input line does not contain exactly three integers separated by whitespace, or if the input line is empty. In such cases, the function still performs the same operations but expects the input to conform to the specified format.
