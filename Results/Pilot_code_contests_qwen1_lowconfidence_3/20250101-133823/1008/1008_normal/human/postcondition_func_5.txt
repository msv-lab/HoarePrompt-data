The function generates and prints a sequence of pairs representing coordinates in a grid of size `rows` by `cols`. It first creates a list of all coordinate pairs in a zigzag pattern starting from `(1, 1)` and ending at `(rows, cols)`. Then, it prints the first `2 * (k - 1)` pairs followed by the remaining pairs in order. If the total number of pairs is less than `2 * k`, it prints the last pair without a trailing space. The function returns nothing. Potential edge cases include when `k` is 1 or when `rows * cols` is less than `2 * k`. In these cases, only the last few pairs might be printed.
