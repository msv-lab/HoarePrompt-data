The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and reads a single line from standard input. It then strips any trailing whitespace from the line and returns the resulting string. Potential edge cases include the input being empty (resulting in an empty string) or the input containing only whitespace (also resulting in an empty string). There is no missing functionality as the code accurately performs the described actions.
