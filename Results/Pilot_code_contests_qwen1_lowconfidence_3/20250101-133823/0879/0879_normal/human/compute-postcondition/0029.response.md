The code `i = bisect_left(b, el)` updates the variable `i` to be the index where `el` should be inserted in the sorted list `b` to maintain its sorted order. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `min_r`, and `el` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `i`. However, we know that `i` is now the result of `bisect_left(b, el)`, which means it is the index where `el` would be inserted in `b`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `b` is a list that maintains a sorted order, `min_r` is updated based on the insertion logic of the next `el` into `b`, and `i` is the index where `el` would be inserted in `b to maintain its sorted order.**
