Postcondition: **`a` is a non-empty list, `b` is a list that maintains a sorted order. `min_r` is updated based on the insertion logic of `el` into `b`. If `i` is 0, `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `abs(el - b[0])`. If `i` equals `m`, `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `abs(el - b[m - 1])`. Otherwise, `min_r` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the minimum of `abs(el - b[i + 1])`, `abs(el - b[i - 1])`, and `abs(el - b[i])`. `i` is the index where `el` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `b`.**
