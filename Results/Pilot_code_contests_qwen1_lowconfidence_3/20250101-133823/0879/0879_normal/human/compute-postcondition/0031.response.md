The code updates the variable `min_r` by taking the maximum value between the current `min_r` and the absolute difference between `el` and `b[m - 1]`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `i` are not affected by this line of code.

Let's denote the specific value of `el` as `el_value` and the specific value of `b[m - 1]` as `b_m_minus_1_value`.

The impact of the code is that `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the absolute difference between `el_value` and `b_m_minus_1_value`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` is a non-empty list, `b` is a list that maintains a sorted order, `i` is the index where `el` would be inserted in `b` to maintain its sorted order, `min_r` is updated to be max(`min_r`, abs(`el` - `b[m - 1]`)).**
