Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list, `b` is a list that maintains sorted order with the element `el` inserted according to the value of `i`. If `i` is 0, `b` has `el` inserted at index 0 and `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of `min_r` and the absolute difference between `el` and `b[0]`. Otherwise, `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the minimum of the absolute differences between `el` and its neighboring elements in `b` up to index `i`. Specifically, if `i` is equal to `m`, `min_r` is the maximum of its original value and `abs(el - b[m - 1])`. Otherwise, `min_r` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the minimum of the absolute differences between `el` and the elements in `b` up to index `i`.***
