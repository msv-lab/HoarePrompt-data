The code reads two integers `n` and `m` from input using `raw_input().split()`, which splits the input into two parts and converts them into integers using `map(int)`. After this operation, the values of `n` and `m` are updated, but the lists `ai` and `bj` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `ai` contains n integers in non-decreasing order; `bj` contains m integers in non-decreasing order.**
