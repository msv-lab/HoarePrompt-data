The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5. Additionally, the function takes two lists: `ai` (a list containing `n` integers in non-decreasing order) and `bj` (a list containing `m` integers in non-decreasing order). 

The output cases are not explicitly provided in the problem statement, so we can only describe the input parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `m` as positive integers with constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, and two lists `ai` and `bj` containing `n` and `m` integers respectively, in non-decreasing order.**
