Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers in non-decreasing order, `b` is a list of integers in non-decreasing order that has been modified during the loop execution to include each element of `a` exactly once while maintaining the sorted order, `min_r` is the maximum absolute difference found during the loop execution between any element of `a` and its closest neighbors in `b`.**
