The code `a = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. The original lists `ai` and `bj` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 â‰¤ n, m â‰¤ 10^5; `ai` contains n integers in non-decreasing order; `bj` contains m integers in non-decreasing order; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**
