The `bisect_left` function is used to find the insertion point for `el` in `b` to maintain sorted order. However, the initial state only mentions `a` as a non-empty list, and there is no `b` or `el` defined in the initial state. Since the code snippet does not provide enough information to determine the exact values of `b` and `el`, we cannot determine the exact value of `i`.

Given this situation, we can only state that `i` is assigned the result of the `bisect_left` function, which returns the index where `el` should be inserted in `b` to keep it sorted. The output state will reflect that `i` has been assigned this index, and all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `i` is the index where `el` should be inserted in `b` to maintain sorted order.**
