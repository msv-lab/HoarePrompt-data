The code assigns `min_r` the value of the maximum between the current value of `min_r` and the absolute difference between `el` and `b[m - 1]`. The variable `i` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `min_r` is updated, while `i`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `el` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `i` is an index where `el` should be inserted in `b` to maintain sorted order, the index `i` is not equal to 0, and `i` is equal to `m`; `min_r` is the maximum of its original value and `abs(el - b[m - 1])`**
