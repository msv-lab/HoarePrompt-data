To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given information and the conditions specified in the problem.

### Given Information:
- `a` is a non-empty list.
- `b` is a list that maintains a sorted order with the element `el` inserted according to the value of `i`.
- If `i` is 0, `b` has `el` inserted at index 0 and `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of `min_r` and the absolute difference between `el` and `b[0]`.
- Otherwise, `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the minimum of the absolute differences between `el` and its neighboring elements in `b` up to index `i`.
- Specifically, if `i` is equal to `m`, `min_r` is the maximum of its original value and `abs(el - b[m - 1])`.
- Otherwise, `min_r` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the minimum of the absolute differences between `el` and the elements in `b` up to index `i`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Initial Conditions:**
   - We know `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `b` is initially sorted, and we need to insert an element `el` into `b` based on the value of `i`.

2. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `el` in the list `a`.

3. **Understand the State After One Iteration:**
   - At the end of the last iteration, we need to consider what happens to `b` and `min_r`.

4. **Consider the Insertion Process:**
   - For each `el` in `a`, `b` is modified to include `el` while maintaining the sorted order.
   - Depending on the value of `i`, `b` will have different configurations and `min_r` will be updated accordingly.

5. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `a`, after the last element is processed, the loop should continue for the next element in `a`.
   - Therefore, `el` will change to the next element in `a`, and `b` will be re-sorted with this new `el` included.

### Conclusion:

At the start of the next iteration of the loop, the state should be:
- `a` remains the same (non-empty list).
- `b` is now a list containing all elements from `a` including the newly added element, sorted.
- `min_r` is updated based on the insertion process as described.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified for the next iteration, we assume it follows the same logic as the previous iteration. 

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `b` is a list that maintains a sorted order with the element `el` (next element from `a`) inserted, and `min_r` is updated based on the insertion logic.**

However, to provide a specific example, we need to specify the next element `el` from `a`. Let's assume the next element from `a` is `x`.

### Specific Example:
If the next element in `a` is `x`, then:
- `a` is a non-empty list.
- `b` is a sorted list with `x` inserted according to the rules described.
- `min_r` is updated based on the insertion of `x`.

State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `b` is a list that maintains a sorted order with the element `x` inserted, and `min_r` is updated based on the insertion logic.**

If we want to generalize without specifying `x`, the state would be:
**`a` is a non-empty list, `b` is a list that maintains a sorted order with the element `el` (next element from `a`) inserted, and `min_r` is updated based on the insertion logic.**
