Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list, and `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the minimum of the absolute differences between `el` and its neighboring elements in `b` up to index `i`. Specifically, if `i` is equal to `m - 1`, then `min_r` is set to the maximum of its current value and the minimum of `abs(el - b[m - 1])` and `abs(el - b[m - 2])`. Otherwise, `min_r` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the minimum of the absolute differences between `el` and the elements in `b` up to index `i`.***
