`b` is assigned the value of the integers from the input split and converted using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This means `b` now contains a list of integers that were inputted. The states of `n`, `m`, `ai`, and `bj` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n integers in non-decreasing order, `bj` contains m integers in non-decreasing order, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**
