Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list, `b` is a list that maintains a sorted order, `i` is the index where `el` would be inserted in `b` to maintain its sorted order. `min_r` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the minimum of the following:
- If `i == m - 1`, then `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the minimum of the absolute differences between `el` and `b[m-1]` and `b[m-2]`.
- Otherwise, `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the minimum of `abs(el - b[i + 1])`, `abs(el - b[i - 1])`, and `abs(el - b[i])`.***

This postcondition encompasses both the if and else parts, ensuring that `min_r` is correctly updated in all possible scenarios based on the value of `i` relative to `m`.
