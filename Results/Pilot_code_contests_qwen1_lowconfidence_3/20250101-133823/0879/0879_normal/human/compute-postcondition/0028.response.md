To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the conditions specified within the loop.

### Given Information:
- `a` is a non-empty list.
- `b` is a list that maintains a sorted order.
- `min_r` is updated based on the insertion logic of `el` into `b`.
- The loop iterates over each element `el` in `a`.

### Conditions within the Loop:
- If `i` is 0, `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `abs(el - b[0])`.
- If `i` equals `m`, `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `abs(el - b[m - 1])`.
- Otherwise (`0 < i < m`), `min_r` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the minimum of `abs(el - b[i + 1])`, `abs(el - b[i - 1])`, and `abs(el - b[i])`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Range of `i`:**
   - `i` starts from 0 and increases as the loop progresses.
   - `i` will eventually reach the length of `b` minus 1 (since `b` is 0-indexed).

2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `b` is a sorted list.
   - `min_r` is updated based on the logic described above.
   - `i` is the index where `el` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `b`.

3. **Next Iteration of the Loop:**
   - For the next iteration, `el` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 (assuming the list `a` has enough elements).

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be the index of the next element being processed.
   - The condition for updating `min_r` will change based on the new value of `i`.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to update the following states:
- `a` remains the same as it is a non-empty list.
- `b` remains the same as it is a sorted list.
- `min_r` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (which is incremented by 1).
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `b` is a list that maintains a sorted order, `min_r` is updated based on the insertion logic of the next `el` into `b`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
