Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list, `b` is a list that maintains a sorted order, `i` is the index where `el` would be inserted in `b` to maintain its sorted order. `min_r` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the minimum of the following:
- If `i == 0`, then `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the absolute difference between `el` and the first element of `b`.
- Otherwise, `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the minimum of the absolute differences between `el` and `b[i + 1]`, `b[i - 1]`, and `b[i]` (if `i` is not at the end of the list).***
