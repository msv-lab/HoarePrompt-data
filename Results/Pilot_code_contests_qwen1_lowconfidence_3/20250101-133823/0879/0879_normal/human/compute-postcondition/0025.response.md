Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list, `b` is a list that maintains a sorted order. `min_r` is updated based on the insertion logic of `el` into `b`. If `i` is the last index (`m-1`), `min_r` is updated to max(`min_r`, min(`abs(el - b[m-1])`, `abs(el - b[m-2])`)). Otherwise, `min_r` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the minimum of `abs(el - b[i + 1])`, `abs(el - b[i - 1])`, and `abs(el - b[i])`. `i` is the index where `el` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `b`.***
