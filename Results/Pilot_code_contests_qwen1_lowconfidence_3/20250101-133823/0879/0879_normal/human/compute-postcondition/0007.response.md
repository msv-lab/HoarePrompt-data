`min_r` is assigned the value of the maximum between `min_r` and the absolute difference between `el` and `b[0]`. Since `b` is a list that maintains sorted order with `el` inserted at index 0, the first element of `b` is `el`. However, the initial value of `min_r` is not specified, so we consider `min_r` as it is initially. The state of `a` and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `b` is a list that maintains sorted order with the element `el` inserted at index 0, and `min_r` is the maximum between `min_r` and the absolute difference between `el` and `b[0]`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `b` is a list that maintains sorted order with the element `el` inserted at index 0, and `min_r` is max(`min_r`, abs(`el` - `b[0]`))**
