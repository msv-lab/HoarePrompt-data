The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (with constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5), and two lists `a` and `b` containing `n` and `m` integers respectively, both in non-decreasing order. It calculates and prints the maximum absolute difference between any element in list `a` and its closest element in list `b`. The function iterates through each element in list `a`, finds the closest elements in list `b`, and updates the minimum radius (`min_r`) if a larger difference is found. If an element in `a` does not have a direct match in `b`, the function considers the nearest elements in `b` to calculate the difference.
