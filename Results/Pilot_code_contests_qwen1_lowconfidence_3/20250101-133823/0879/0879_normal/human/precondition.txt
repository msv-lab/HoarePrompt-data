n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5. The sequence a1, a2, ..., an contains non-decreasing integers such that -10^9 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, representing the coordinates of cities. The sequence b1, b2, ..., bm contains non-decreasing integers such that -10^9 ≤ bj ≤ 10^9, representing the coordinates of cellular towers.
