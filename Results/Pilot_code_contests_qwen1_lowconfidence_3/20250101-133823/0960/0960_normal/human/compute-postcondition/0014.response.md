Let's analyze the given `while` loop condition and the current state to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while m > 0 and node2_nr < n:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer greater than 3
- `m` is a positive integer less than the original value
- `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`
- `edges` is a list including tuples from `(0, 1)` to `(n-2, n-1)` and `(1, 3)`
- `node1_nr` is 1
- `node2_nr` is 4

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the `while` loop must be true:
1. `m > 0`
2. `node2_nr < n`

Let's break down each condition:

1. **Condition 1: `m > 0`**
   - Currently, `m` is a positive integer less than the original value.
   - To ensure `m > 0`, `m` should still be greater than 0.
   - No adjustment is needed since `m` is already a positive integer.

2. **Condition 2: `node2_nr < n`**
   - Currently, `node2_nr` is 4.
   - For `node2_nr < n` to be true, `n` must be greater than 4.

Since `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

Final answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `m` is a positive integer less than the original value, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `edges` is a list including tuples from `(0, 1)` to `(n-2, n-1)` and `(1, 3)`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 4**
