The code initializes a list called `edges` using a list comprehension. This list contains tuples `(i, i + 1)` for each integer `i` in the range from `0` to `n - 2`. The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `v` also remains unchanged.

The list `edges` is created with the specified structure, and since `m` and `v` are not modified by this code, they retain their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100000, `m` is an integer between 0 and 100000 with `m` being less than `n - 1`, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `edges` is a list of tuples [(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1)]**
