`m` is decremented by 1. The initial state was that `m` must be greater than 1, so after decrementing, `m` will still be greater than 1 (since it was at least 2 initially). The values of the other variables (`node1_nr`, `node2_nr`, `n`, and `edges`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `node1_nr` is 3, `node2_nr` is 6, `n` must be greater than 6, `edges` is a list containing the tuples `(3, 5)` and `(3, 6)`**
