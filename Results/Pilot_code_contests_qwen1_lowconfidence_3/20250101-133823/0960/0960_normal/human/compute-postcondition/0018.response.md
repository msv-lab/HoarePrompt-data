Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `n` must be greater than 4
   - `m` is a positive integer less than the original value - 1
   - `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`
   - `edges` is now a list including tuples from `(0, 1)`, `(1, 3)`, and `(n-2, n-1)`, along with `(1, 4)`
   - `node1_nr` is 1
   - `node2_nr` is 5

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`.

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop must be true:
     1. `m > 0`
     2. `node2_nr < n`

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - **Condition 1:** `m > 0`
     - At the end of the previous iteration, `m` was a positive integer less than the original value - 1. To ensure the loop can execute again, `m` must still be greater than 0.
     - Since `m` was less than the original value - 1, it could have been reduced but still be greater than 0. Therefore, no additional constraints on `m` are necessary; we just need to confirm it is greater than 0.
   - **Condition 2:** `node2_nr < n`
     - At the end of the previous iteration, `node2_nr` was 5. For the loop to continue, `node2_nr` must be less than `n`.
     - Given `n` must be greater than 4, and `node2_nr` was 5, `n` must be greater than 5 for the loop to continue.

5. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - We need to ensure that `m` is greater than 0 and `n` is greater than 5.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `m` is a positive integer less than the original value - 1, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `edges` is now a list including tuples from `(0, 1)`, `(1, 3)`, and `(n-2, n-1)`, along with `(1, 4)`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 5**
