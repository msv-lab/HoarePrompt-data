`n` is initially greater than 5, and `m` is decremented by 1. However, the initial value of `m` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the only variable that changes is `m`, which is decreased by 1. The condition that `n` must be greater than 5 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5; `m` is `m - 1`**
