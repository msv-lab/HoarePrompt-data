`m` is decremented by 1, which means `m -= 1`. Since `m` was initially greater than 0, after decrementing, `m` will still be a positive integer, but it will be reduced by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `m` is a positive integer less than the original value, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `edges` is a list including tuples from `(0, 1)` to `(n-2, n-1)` and `(1, 3)`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 3**
