`edges` is a list that gets a new tuple appended to it, containing the values of `node1_nr` and `node2_nr`. The values of `node1_nr` and `node2_nr` remain unchanged, and the conditions on `m` and `n` also remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` must be greater than 0, `node1_nr` is 3, `node2_nr` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5, and `edges` is a list containing the tuple `(3, 5)`.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `node1_nr` is 3, `node2_nr` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5, and `edges` is a list containing the tuple `(3, 5)`**
