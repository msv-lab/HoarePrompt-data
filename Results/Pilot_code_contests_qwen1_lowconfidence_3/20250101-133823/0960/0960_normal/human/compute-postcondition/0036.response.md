`m` is decremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `m` must be greater than 1, so after decrementing by 1, `m` will still be a positive integer but reduced by 1 from its original value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 5; `m` is greater than 0; `node2_nr` must be less than `n`; `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5; `m` is greater than 0; `node2_nr` must be less than `n`; `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`**.
