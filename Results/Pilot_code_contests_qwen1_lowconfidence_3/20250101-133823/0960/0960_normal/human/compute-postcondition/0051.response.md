The code appends a new tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. Given that `node1_nr` is 3 and `node2_nr` is 7, the new tuple `(3, 7)` is added to the list `edges`. The values of `m`, `node1_nr`, `node2_nr`, `n`, and the existing content of `edges` are updated accordingly.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0; `node1_nr` is 3; `node2_nr` is 7; `n` must be greater than 7; `edges` is a list containing the tuples `(3, 5)`, `(3, 6)`, and `(3, 7)`**
