Output State: **`m` is 0, `node1_nr` is `n`, `node2_nr` is `n`, `n` is the same as the original value of `n`, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `edges` is a list containing tuples from `(0, 1)` to `(n-2, n-1)` and additional tuples starting from `(1, 3)` up to `(n-2, n-1)`, `translate` is a list where the elements at indices `v - 1` and `1` are swapped, making `translate[v - 1]` equal to `1` and `translate[1]` equal to `v`, and `output` is a list of strings where each string is formatted as '%d %d' with the first number being `1` and the second number being `v`.**
