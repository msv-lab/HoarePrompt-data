Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `n` is an integer greater than or equal to the original value of `n` (initially between 3 and 100000).
   - `m` is 0.
   - `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
   - `edges` is a list including tuples from `(0, 1)` to `(n-2, n-1)` and additional tuples starting from `(1, 3)` up to `(1, n-1)`.
   - `node1_nr` is 2.
   - `node2_nr` is `n`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `m > 0 and node1_nr < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `m` is 0.
   - `node1_nr` is 2.
   - `node2_nr` is `n`.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions `m > 0` and `node1_nr < n` must be true.

5. **Analysis**:
   - Since `m` is currently 0, the first condition `m > 0` is false. Therefore, the loop cannot execute until `m` is greater than 0.
   - The second condition `node1_nr < n` is true since `node1_nr` is 2 and `n` is at least 3.

6. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - To satisfy the condition `m > 0`, `m` must be set to a positive value.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `m` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to the original value of n (initially between 3 and 100000), `m` must be greater than 0, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `edges` is a list including tuples from `(0, 1)` to `(n-2, n-1)` and additional tuples starting from `(1, 3)` up to `(1, n-1)`, `node1_nr` is 2, `node2_nr` is `n`**
