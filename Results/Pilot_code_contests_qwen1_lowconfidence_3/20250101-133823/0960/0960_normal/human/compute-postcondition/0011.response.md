`edges` is a list of tuples, initially containing tuples from `(0, 1)` to `(n-2, n-1)`. The code appends a new tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to `edges`. Given that `node1_nr` is 1 and `node2_nr` is 3, the new tuple added to `edges` is `(1, 3)`. 

Therefore, the updated `edges` list now includes all the original tuples plus the new tuple `(1, 3)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `m` must be greater than 0, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `edges` is a list including tuples from `(0, 1)` to `(n-2, n-1)` and `(1, 3)`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 3**
