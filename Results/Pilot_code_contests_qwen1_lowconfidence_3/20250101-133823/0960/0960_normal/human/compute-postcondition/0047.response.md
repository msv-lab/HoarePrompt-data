The code `edges.append((node1_nr, node2_nr))` appends the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. Given the initial values:

- `node1_nr` is 3
- `node2_nr` is 6
- `edges` is a list containing the tuple `(3, 5)`

After executing the code, the tuple `(3, 6)` will be appended to the list `edges`. The list `edges` will now contain two tuples: `(3, 5)` and `(3, 6)`.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `node1_nr` is 3, `node2_nr` is 6, `n` must be greater than 6, `edges` is a list containing the tuples `(3, 5)` and `(3, 6)`**
