`m` is decremented by 1. The original value of `m` was a positive integer less than the original value, so the new value of `m` is one less than its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `m` is a positive integer less than the original value - 1, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `edges` is now a list including tuples from `(0, 1)`, `(1, 3)`, and `(n-2, n-1)`, along with `(1, 4)`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 4**
