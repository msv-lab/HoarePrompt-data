The value of `node2_nr` is incremented by 1. The original value of `node2_nr` is 3, so after incrementing, `node2_nr` becomes 4. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `m` is a positive integer less than the original value, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `edges` is a list including tuples from `(0, 1)` to `(n-2, n-1)` and `(1, 3)`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 4**
