`m` is decremented by 1. The initial state tells us that `m` must be greater than 0, so after decrementing by 1, `m` will still be greater than 0 (assuming it was initially at least 2). The values of `node1_nr`, `node2_nr`, `n`, and `edges` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a value greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `node1_nr` is 3, `node2_nr` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5, and `edges` is a list containing the tuple `(3, 5)`**
