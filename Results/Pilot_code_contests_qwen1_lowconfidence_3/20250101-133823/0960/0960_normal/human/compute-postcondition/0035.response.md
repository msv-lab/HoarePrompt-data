`edges.append((node1_nr, node2_nr))` adds the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. The values of `node1_nr` and `node2_nr` are appended to the list `edges`, but their individual values remain unchanged. The conditions on `n`, `m`, and the relationship between `node2_nr` and `n` remain valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5; `m` must be greater than 1; `node2_nr` must be less than `n`; `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`**
