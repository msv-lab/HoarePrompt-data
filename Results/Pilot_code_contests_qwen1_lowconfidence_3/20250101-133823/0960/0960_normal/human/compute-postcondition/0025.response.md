The code changes the value of `node2_nr` by adding 2 to `node1_nr`. Initially, `node1_nr` is 2. Therefore, `node2_nr` becomes 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to the original value of n (initially between 3 and 100000), `m` must be greater than 0, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `edges` is a list including tuples from `(0, 1)` to `(n-2, n-1)` and additional tuples starting from `(1, 3)` up to `(1, n-1)`, `node1_nr` is 2, `node2_nr` is 4**
