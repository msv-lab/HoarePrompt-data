The code `print(-1)` simply prints `-1` to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `m`, or `v`. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100000 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 0 and 100000 (inclusive) with `m` being less than `n - 1`, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive)**
