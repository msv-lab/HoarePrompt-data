Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given States:
- `n` must be greater than 4
- `m` is 0
- `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`
- `edges` is a list including tuples from (0, 1) to (n-2, n-1) and additional tuples starting from (1, 3) up to (1, n-1), and now includes tuples from (2, 4) to (2, n-1)
- `node1_nr` is 3
- `node2_nr` is `n`

### Loop Condition:
```
while m > 0 and node1_nr < n:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop condition is `m > 0 and node1_nr < n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true in the next iteration.

2. **Current Values**:
   - `m` is 0.
   - `node1_nr` is 3.
   - `n` is greater than 4.

3. **Adjusting Conditions**:
   - Since `m` is currently 0, it cannot be greater than 0. Therefore, `m` needs to be adjusted to a value greater than 0.
   - Since `node1_nr` is currently 3, it is less than `n` (which is greater than 4). Thus, `node1_nr` needs to be adjusted to a value that is still less than `n`.

### Adjusted States:

- To make `m > 0`, we need to set `m` to a value greater than 0.
- To keep `node1_nr < n`, `node1_nr` should remain as it is since it is already less than `n`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `node1_nr` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4**
