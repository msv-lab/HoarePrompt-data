The value of `node2_nr` is incremented by 1. The original value of `node2_nr` was 5, so after incrementing, it becomes 6. The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `m` is a positive integer less than the original value - 1 (now `m` is one less than its original value), `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `edges` is now a list including tuples from `(0, 1)`, `(1, 3)`, and `(n-2, n-1)`, and also includes `(1, 5)`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 6**
