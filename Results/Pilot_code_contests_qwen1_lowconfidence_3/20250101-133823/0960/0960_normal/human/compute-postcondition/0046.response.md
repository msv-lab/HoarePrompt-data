Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `m` is a value greater than 0 (decremented by 1)
   - `node1_nr` is 3
   - `node2_nr` is 6
   - `n` must be greater than 5
   - `edges` is a list containing the tuple `(3, 5)`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs while `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`.

3. **Analyzing the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true:
     - `m > 0`
     - `node2_nr < n`

4. **Current Values:**
   - `m` is a value greater than 0 (decremented by 1), so it was at least 1 before the decrement.
   - `node2_nr` is 6, and we need `node2_nr < n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 5.

5. **Ensuring the Loop Executes Again:**
   - To ensure `m > 0`, `m` must be at least 1 after the current iteration. Since `m` was decremented by 1, it must have been at least 2 before the decrement.
   - To ensure `node2_nr < n`, `node2_nr` is currently 6, so `n` must be greater than 6.

Given these requirements, we need to adjust the following states:
- `m` must be at least 1 before decrementing, meaning it was at least 2 before the decrement.
- `n` must be greater than 6 to satisfy `node2_nr < n`.

Therefore, the modified state should be:
**State: `m` must be greater than 1, `node1_nr` is 3, `node2_nr` is 6, `n` must be greater than 6, and `edges` is a list containing the tuple `(3, 5)`**
