The value of `node1_nr` is set to 1. The code `node2_nr = node1_nr + 2` adds 2 to the value of `node1_nr`, resulting in `node2_nr` being 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100000, `m` must be greater than 0, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `edges` is a list of tuples [(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1)], `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 3**
