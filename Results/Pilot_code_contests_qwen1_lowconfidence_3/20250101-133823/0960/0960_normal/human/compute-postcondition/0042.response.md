Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `node1_nr` is 3.
   - `node2_nr` is 5.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `node2_nr` is 5.
   - For the condition `node2_nr < n` to be true, `n` must be greater than 5 (since `node2_nr` is 5).

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - We need `m` to be greater than 0 (which is already given).
   - We need `node2_nr` to be less than `n`, and since `node2_nr` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5.

So, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `n` is greater than 5.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `node1_nr` is 3, `node2_nr` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5**
