`node2_nr` is incremented by 1. The original value of `node2_nr` is 5, so it becomes 6. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a value greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `node1_nr` is 3, `node2_nr` is 6, `n` must be greater than 5, and `edges` is a list containing the tuple `(3, 5)`.

Output State: **`m` is a value greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `node1_nr` is 3, `node2_nr` is 6, `n` must be greater than 5, and `edges` is a list containing the tuple `(3, 5)`**
