`node2_nr` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions state that `n` must be greater than 5, `m` is greater than 0, `node2_nr` must be less than `n`, and `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`. Since `node2_nr` was initially less than `n`, after incrementing, `node2_nr` will still be less than `n`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5; `m` is greater than 0; `node2_nr` must be less than `n`; `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`; `node2_nr` is increased by 1.**
