`edges` is a list of tuples, and the code appends a new tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to this list. Given that `node1_nr` is 1 and `node2_nr` is 5, the new tuple `(1, 5)` is appended to `edges`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `m` is a positive integer less than the original value - 1, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `edges` is now a list including tuples from `(0, 1)`, `(1, 3)`, and `(n-2, n-1)`, and also includes `(1, 5)`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 5**
