`node1_nr` is incremented by 1. The original value of `node1_nr` is 2, so it becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 4; `m` is 0; `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `edges` is a list including tuples from (0, 1) to (n-2, n-1) and additional tuples starting from (1, 3) up to (1, n-1), and now includes tuples from (2, 4) to (2, n-1); `node1_nr` is 3; `node2_nr` is `n`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4; `m` is 0; `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `edges` is a list including tuples from (0, 1) to (n-2, n-1) and additional tuples starting from (1, 3) up to (1, n-1), and now includes tuples from (2, 4) to (2, n-1); `node1_nr` is 3; `node2_nr` is `n`.**
