`m` is decremented by 1. Initially, `m` is a positive integer less than the original value - 1. After decrementing, `m` is still a positive integer, but it is now one less than its original value.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `m` is a positive integer less than the original value - 1 (now `m` is one less than its original value), `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `edges` is now a list including tuples from `(0, 1)`, `(1, 3)`, and `(n-2, n-1)`, and also includes `(1, 5)`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 5**
