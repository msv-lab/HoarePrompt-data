`node2_nr` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 7 to 8. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`m` is `m - 1`, `node1_nr` is 3, `node2_nr` is 8, `n` must be greater than 7, `edges` is a list containing the tuples `(3, 5)`, `(3, 6)`, and `(3, 7)`**
