The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `node1_nr`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `v`, or the `edges` list. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100000, `m` is an integer between -99997 and 100000, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `edges` is a list of tuples [(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1)], `node1_nr` is 1**
