Functionality: **The function takes three parameters \( n \), \( m \), and \( v \), where \( n \) is the number of servers, \( m \) is the number of direct connections, and \( v \) is the index of the critical server. The function first checks if the number of connections \( m \) is less than \( n - 1 \). If so, it prints \(-1\) and exits. Otherwise, it constructs a set of edges connecting the servers such that each server is connected to its immediate neighbor and additional connections are made to ensure the total number of connections equals \( m \). It then swaps the indices of the critical server \( v \) and the first server (index 1) in a translation list. Finally, it generates and prints a list of the translated edges. If the number of connections is still greater than 0 after constructing the edges, it prints \(-1\) and exits.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \( m < n - 1 \), the function prints \(-1\) and exits.
- If \( m = n - 1 \), the function constructs the basic connections between servers and exits without further modifications.
- If \( v \) is 1, swapping it with itself results in no change in the translation list.
- If \( v \) is the last server (i.e., \( v = n \)), the swap with the first server ensures the critical server's index is changed appropriately.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes \( n \geq 3 \) and \( 1 \leq v \leq n \). It does not handle cases where \( n < 3 \) or \( v < 1 \) or \( v > n \).
