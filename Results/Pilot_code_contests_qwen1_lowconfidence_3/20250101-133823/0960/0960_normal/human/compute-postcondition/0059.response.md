The code `exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately without executing any further code. Since no variables are modified within this context, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `node1_nr` is `n`, `node2_nr` is `n`, `n` is the same as the original value of `n`, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `edges` is a list containing tuples from `(0, 1)` to `(n-2, n-1)` and additional tuples starting from `(1, 3)` up to `(n-2, n-1)`, and the program exits.**
