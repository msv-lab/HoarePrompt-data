`edges` is a list of tuples including `(0, 1)`, `(1, 3)`, and `(n-2, n-1)`. The code appends a new tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to `edges`. Given that `node1_nr` is 1 and `node2_nr` is 4, the new tuple `(1, 4)` is added to `edges`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `m` is a positive integer less than the original value, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `edges` is now a list including tuples from `(0, 1)`, `(1, 3)`, and `(n-2, n-1)`, along with `(1, 4)`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 4**
