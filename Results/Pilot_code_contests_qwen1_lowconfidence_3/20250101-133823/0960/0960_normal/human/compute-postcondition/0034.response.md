Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 5
   - `m` is `m - 1`
   - `node2_nr` is incremented by 1

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs while `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`.

3. **Determine Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions inside the `while` loop must be true.
   - First condition: `m > 0`
   - Second condition: `node2_nr < n`

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - To satisfy `m > 0`, since `m` is `m - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, `m` must be greater than 0 before decrementing.
   - To satisfy `node2_nr < n`, `node2_nr` must be less than `n` before incrementing.

Given the constraints:
- `n` must be greater than 5 (as given in the current state).
- `m` must be greater than 1 before decrementing to satisfy `m > 0`.
- `node2_nr` must be less than `n` before incrementing to satisfy `node2_nr < n`.

Therefore, the required adjustments are:
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `node2_nr` must be less than `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 5; `m` must be greater than 1; `node2_nr` must be less than `n`**
