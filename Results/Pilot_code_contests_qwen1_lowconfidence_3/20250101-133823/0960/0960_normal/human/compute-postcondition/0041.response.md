The code assigns the value of `node1_nr + 2` to `node2_nr`. Given that `node1_nr` is 3, the value of `node2_nr` becomes 5. The conditions for `m` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `m` must be greater than 0
- `node1_nr` is 3
- `node2_nr` is 5
- `n` must be greater than 4

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `node1_nr` is 3, `node2_nr` is 5, `n` must be greater than 4**
