The `exit()` function call does not assign any new values to the variables and simply terminates the program. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100000, `m` is an integer between 0 and 100000 with `m` being less than `n - 1`, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`**
