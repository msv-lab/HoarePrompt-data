The code reads three integers from input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `v`. Since the input is not provided in the initial state, the specific values of these variables remain unknown, but they follow the given constraints.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100000 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 0 and 100000 (inclusive), `v` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive)**
