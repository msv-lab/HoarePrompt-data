`node2_nr` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4; `m` is a positive integer less than its original value; `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `edges` is a list including tuples from (0, 1) to (n-2, n-1) and additional tuples starting from (1, 3) up to (1, n-1), and now also includes (2, 4); `node1_nr` is 2; `node2_nr` is 5**
