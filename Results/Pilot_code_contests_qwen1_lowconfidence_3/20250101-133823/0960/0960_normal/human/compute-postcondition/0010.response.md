Let's break down the given conditions and the requirements for the loop to execute at least once:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `n` is an integer between 3 and 100000.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
   - `edges` is a list of tuples from `(0, 1)` to `(n-2, n-1)`.
   - `node1_nr` is 1.
   - `node2_nr` is 3.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   ```python
   while m > 0 and node2_nr < n:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

For the loop to execute at least one iteration, both conditions inside the `while` loop must be true after any necessary adjustments:

- The condition `m > 0` means `m` must be greater than 0.
- The condition `node2_nr < n` means `node2_nr` must be less than `n`.

Given the initial values:
- `node2_nr` is 3.
- For the loop to proceed, `node2_nr` must be less than `n`.

Since `n` is an integer between 3 and 100000, the only condition that needs adjustment is ensuring `node2_nr` is less than `n`. Given that `node2_nr` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3 to satisfy the second condition.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is greater than 3.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `m` must be greater than 0, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `edges` is a list of tuples from `(0, 1)` to `(n-2, n-1)`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 3**
