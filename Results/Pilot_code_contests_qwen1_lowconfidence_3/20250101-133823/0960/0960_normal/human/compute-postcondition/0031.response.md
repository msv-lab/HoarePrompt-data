The code snippet `edges.append((node1_nr, node2_nr))` appends a tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. However, the initial state does not provide any specific values for `edges`, `node1_nr`, or `node2_nr`. The only precondition given is that `n` must be greater than 5. Since no variables are updated or modified by this line of code, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5**
