To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions of the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```python
while m > 0 and node2_nr < n:
```

We need to ensure that both conditions are true for the loop to proceed:

1. **Condition 1:** `m > 0`
   - The state right before the loop is given as `m` must be greater than 0. Since this condition is already met, no adjustment is needed for `m`.

2. **Condition 2:** `node2_nr < n`
   - The state right before the loop is given as `node2_nr` is 4 and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to the original value of `n` (initially between 3 and 100000). For the loop to execute, `node2_nr` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `node2_nr` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4 for the condition `node2_nr < n` to be true.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` is greater than 4.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `m` must be greater than 0, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `edges` is a list including tuples from `(0, 1)` to `(n-2, n-1)` and additional tuples starting from `(1, 3)` up to `(1, n-1), `node1_nr` is 2, `node2_nr` is 4**
