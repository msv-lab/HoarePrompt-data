`m` is decremented by 1. The original value of `m` is greater than 0, so after decrementing, `m` will still be a positive integer but one less than its original value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 4; `m` is a positive integer less than its original value; `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `edges` is a list including tuples from (0, 1) to (n-2, n-1) and additional tuples starting from (1, 3) up to (1, n-1), and now also includes (2, 4); `node1_nr` is 2; `node2_nr` is 4.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4; `m` is a positive integer less than its original value; `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `edges` is a list including tuples from (0, 1) to (n-2, n-1) and additional tuples starting from (1, 3) up to (1, n-1), and now also includes (2, 4); `node1_nr` is 2; `node2_nr` is 4**
