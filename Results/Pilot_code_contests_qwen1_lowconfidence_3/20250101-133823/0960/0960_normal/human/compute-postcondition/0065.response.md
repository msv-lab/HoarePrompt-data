The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `v`. `n` is an integer representing the number of servers, `m` is an integer representing the number of direct connections, and `v` is an integer representing the index of the server that, if it fails, will cause the system to fail. The constraints are 3 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 100000, and 1 ≤ v ≤ n.

Based on the given output cases, the function will return different values depending on the conditions specified. However, since no specific return values or cases are explicitly mentioned other than the parameter descriptions, we can conclude that the function returns information related to the server system's failure condition.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `v`, where `n` is the number of servers, `m` is the number of direct connections, and `v` is the index of the critical server.**
