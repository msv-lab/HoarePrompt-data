Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```
while m > 0 and node2_nr < n:
```

### Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `n` must be greater than 4.
- `m` is a positive integer less than its original value.
- `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
- `edges` is a list including tuples from (0, 1) to (n-2, n-1) and additional tuples starting from (1, 3) up to (1, n-1), and now also includes (2, 4).
- `node1_nr` is 2.
- `node2_nr` is 5.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop continues as long as `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`.

2. **Check `m > 0`**:
   - `m` is a positive integer less than its original value, meaning it has decreased by at least 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `m` must still be greater than 0. Since it was a positive integer before and has decreased, `m` must still be greater than 0.
   - No adjustment is needed for `m` since it already satisfies `m > 0`.

3. **Check `node2_nr < n`**:
   - Currently, `node2_nr` is 5.
   - For the loop to continue, `node2_nr` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `n` must be greater than 4, for `node2_nr < n` to hold true, `n` must be greater than 5.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 5.

### Adjusted States

To ensure the loop executes one more time, the state must be modified such that `n` is greater than 5. No other adjustments are necessary because `m` is already a positive integer less than its original value and will remain greater than 0 until `m` becomes 0.

### Final Answer
State: **`n` must be greater than 5**
