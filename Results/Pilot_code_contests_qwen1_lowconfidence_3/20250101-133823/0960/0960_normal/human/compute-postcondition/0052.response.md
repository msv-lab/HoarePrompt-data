`m` is decremented by 1, reducing its value by 1. The values of `node1_nr`, `node2_nr`, `n`, and `edges` remain unchanged. The initial condition that `m` is greater than 0 still holds, but now `m` is `m - 1`.

Output State: **`m` is `m - 1`, `node1_nr` is 3, `node2_nr` is 7, `n` must be greater than 7, `edges` is a list containing the tuples `(3, 5)`, `(3, 6)`, and `(3, 7)`**
