Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to the original value of `n` (initially between 3 and 100000), `m` is 0, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `edges` is a list including tuples from `(0, 1)` to `(n-2, n-1)` and additional tuples starting from `(1, 3)` up to `(1, n-1)`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is `n`**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`. Each iteration of the loop adds a new tuple to the `edges` list, where the first element of the tuple (`node1_nr`) is always 1, and the second element (`node2_nr`) increases by 1 each time.
- The loop increments `node2_nr` until it reaches `n`, and for each iteration, `m` decreases by 1.
- Once `m` reaches 0, the loop terminates, meaning that `m` will be 0 when the loop finishes.
- The value of `node2_nr` will be `n` because it starts at 3 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n`.
- Therefore, after the loop completes, `n` remains the same as the original value, `m` is 0, `node1_nr` remains 1, `node2_nr` is `n`, and `edges` contains all the tuples from `(0, 1)` to `(n-2, n-1)` plus the tuples starting from `(1, 3)` up to `(1, n-1)`.
