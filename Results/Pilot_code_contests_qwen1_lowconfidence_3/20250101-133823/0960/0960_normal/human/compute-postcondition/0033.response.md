The code `node2_nr += 1` increments the value of `node2_nr` by 1. Since `node2_nr` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is initialized to some value before this operation. However, the exact initial value is not specified, so we only know that `node2_nr` has been incremented by 1.

The initial state conditions that remain valid are: `n` must be greater than 5; `m` is `m - 1`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5; `m` is `m - 1`; `node2_nr` is incremented by 1**
