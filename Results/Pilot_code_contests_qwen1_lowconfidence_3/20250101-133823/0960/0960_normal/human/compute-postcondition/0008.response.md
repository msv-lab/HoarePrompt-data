Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is an integer between 3 and 100000.
   - `m` is an integer between -99997 and 100000.
   - `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
   - `edges` is a list of tuples representing edges in a graph, where each tuple `(i, i+1)` represents an edge from node `i` to node `i+1`.
   - `node1_nr` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs as long as `m > 0` and `node1_nr < n`.

3. **Current Values**:
   - `node1_nr` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, both conditions `m > 0` and `node1_nr < n` must be true.
     - Since `node1_nr` is 1, the condition `node1_nr < n` is already satisfied for any valid `n`.
     - Therefore, we only need to ensure that `m > 0`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - To make sure the loop executes at least once, we need to ensure `m > 0`.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `m` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100000, `m` must be greater than 0, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `edges` is a list of tuples [(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1)], `node1_nr` is 1**
