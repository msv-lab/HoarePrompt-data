Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4; `m` is 0; `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `edges` is a list including tuples from (0, 1) to (n-2, n-1) and additional tuples starting from (1, 3) up to (1, n-1), and now includes tuples from (2, 4) to (2, n-1); `node1_nr` is 2; `node2_nr` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`.
- Each iteration of the loop appends a new tuple to `edges`, with `node1_nr` fixed at 2 and `node2_nr` incrementing by 1.
- After each iteration, `m` decreases by 1, and `node2_nr` increases by 1.
- The loop stops when `m` reaches 0 or `node2_nr` reaches `n`.

Since the loop runs until `m` is 0, the final value of `m` is 0. Also, since `node2_nr` starts at 4 and increments by 1 with each iteration, it will reach `n` after `n - 4` iterations, making the final value of `node2_nr` equal to `n`.
