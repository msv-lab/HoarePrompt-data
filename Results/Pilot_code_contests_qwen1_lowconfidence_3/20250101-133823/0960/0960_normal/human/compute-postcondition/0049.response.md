`node2_nr` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `node2_nr` is 6, so after the increment, `node2_nr` becomes 7. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `node1_nr` is 3, `node2_nr` is 7, `n` must be greater than 6, `edges` is a list containing the tuples `(3, 5)` and `(3, 6)`**
