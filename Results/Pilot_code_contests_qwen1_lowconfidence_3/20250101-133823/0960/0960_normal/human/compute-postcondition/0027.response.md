The code appends a tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the `edges` list. Given that `node1_nr` is 2 and `node2_nr` is 4, the tuple `(2, 4)` is added to the list `edges`. All other variables remain unchanged.

The initial state includes:
- `n` must be greater than 4
- `m` must be greater than 0
- `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`
- `edges` is a list including tuples from `(0, 1)` to `(n-2, n-1)` and additional tuples starting from `(1, 3)` up to `(1, n-1)`
- `node1_nr` is 2
- `node2_nr` is 4

After executing the code, the updated `edges` list will include the new tuple `(2, 4)`. The output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4; `m` must be greater than 0; `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `edges` is a list including tuples from (0, 1) to (n-2, n-1) and additional tuples starting from (1, 3) up to (1, n-1), and now also includes (2, 4); `node1_nr` is 2; `node2_nr` is 4**
