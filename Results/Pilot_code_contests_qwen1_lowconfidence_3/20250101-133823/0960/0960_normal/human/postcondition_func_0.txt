The function takes three parameters \( n \), \( m \), and \( v \), where \( n \) is the number of servers, \( m \) is the number of direct connections, and \( v \) is the index of the critical server. The function first checks if the number of connections \( m \) is less than \( n - 1 \). If so, it prints \(-1\) and exits. Otherwise, it constructs a set of edges connecting the servers such that each server is connected to its immediate neighbor and additional connections are made to ensure the total number of connections equals \( m \). It then swaps the indices of the critical server \( v \) and the first server (index 1) in a translation list. Finally, it generates and prints a list of the translated edges. If the number of connections is still greater than 0 after constructing the edges, it prints \(-1\) and exits.
