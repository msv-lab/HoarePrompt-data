Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the critical server \( v \) is the first server (index 1). In such a scenario, the code simply swaps the indices of server \( v \) and the first server, which results in no change to the connections since the first server remains unchanged. This means the system will still remain connected even if the first server fails, which violates the requirement that the system should fail if server \( v \) fails.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

```
5 6 1
```

The expected output should be that the system cannot be connected in the required way because the first server cannot be swapped with itself to disconnect the system. However, the current implementation will incorrectly print the edges without handling this special case, leading to a connected system even when the first server fails. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
