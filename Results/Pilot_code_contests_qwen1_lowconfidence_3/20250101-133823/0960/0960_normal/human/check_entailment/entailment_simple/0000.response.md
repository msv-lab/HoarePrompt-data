Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the failure of server `v` disconnects the system, making it impossible to transmit data between some other two servers. Instead, the program creates a fully connected graph with additional edges, which ensures the system remains connected even if any single server fails.

To meet the problem requirements, the program needs to create a structure where the failure of server `v` would indeed disconnect the system. One way to achieve this is to ensure that server `v` is a bridge or a critical point in the network. For example, you could design the connections such that server `v` is only directly connected to a few other servers, and those servers are not directly connected to each other.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program that addresses this requirement:

```python
def func():
    n, m, v = map(int, input().split())
    if m < n - 1:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    edges = []
    
    # Connect all servers except server v to server v
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i == v:
            continue
        edges.append((v, i))
        m -= 1
        if m == 0:
            break
    
    # Add additional edges to reach the required count m
    remaining_servers = [i for i in range(1, n) if i != v]
    for i in range(len(remaining_servers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(remaining_servers)):
            if m <= 0:
                break
            edges.append((remaining_servers[i], remaining_servers[j]))
            m -= 1
    
    if m > 0:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    # Translate server indices
    translate = {i + 1: i for i in range(n)}
    translate[v], translate[1] = translate[1], translate[v]
    output = [' '.join(map(str, edge)) for edge in edges]
    print('\n'.join(output))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Connect all servers except server `v` to server `v`:** This ensures that if server `v` fails, the network is disconnected because there is no path between any two servers that do not include server `v`.
2. **Add additional edges to reach the required count `m`:** After connecting the servers to `v`, add more edges between the remaining servers to reach the required number of edges `m`.
3. **Translation step:** Adjust the server indices according to the problem's requirement.

This approach ensures that the failure of server `v` will indeed disconnect the system, fulfilling the problem's requirements.
