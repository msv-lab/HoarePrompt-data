Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to meet the requirements of the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it aligns with the problem statement:

1. **Input Validation**: 
   - The program first checks if the number of direct connections `m` is less than `n - 1`. If this condition holds, it immediately prints `-1` and exits, as per the problem description which states that it is impossible to connect the servers if `m < n - 1`.

2. **Connection Construction**:
   - The program constructs a series of direct connections such that each server is connected to its immediate neighbor. This ensures that the servers form a linear chain, which is a connected graph.
   - Additional connections are added to reach the required number of `m` connections. These connections are made between non-adjacent servers, ensuring that the system remains connected but that removing any single server (especially the specified critical server `v`) would disconnect the network.

3. **Critical Server Handling**:
   - The program swaps the indices of the critical server `v` and the first server (index 1) in a translation list. This ensures that the critical server `v` is treated specially in the final output, making sure that if this server fails, the system becomes disconnected.
   - The final output is generated by translating the original edge indices according to this swap and printing them out.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `m` is exactly `n - 1` by adding additional connections, which satisfies the requirement to make the system more robust.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where `m` is more than `n - 1` by ensuring the system remains connected and the critical server `v` can disconnect the system.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic needed to meet the problem description in all cases, ensuring that the system is connected unless the specified server `v` fails. Therefore, the program is correct.
