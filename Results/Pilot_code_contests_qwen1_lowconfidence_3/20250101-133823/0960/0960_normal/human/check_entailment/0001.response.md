Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the server with index `v` is directly connected to all other servers, making it impossible to disconnect the network by failing just that one server. Specifically, the program constructs a tree-like structure where each server is connected to the next in a sequence, and then attempts to add additional connections. However, this approach does not guarantee that the failure of server `v` will disconnect the network.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 6 3
```

The program outputs:
```
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
1 3
3 5
```

In this setup, servers 1, 2, 4, and 5 are still connected even after server 3 fails, which does not satisfy the requirement that the failure of server `v` should disconnect the network.

To meet the requirement, the program needs to ensure that the server `v` is a central node in the network such that its failure would isolate parts of the network. One way to achieve this is to create a star topology where `v` is the center, and all other servers are directly connected to `v`. This would ensure that removing `v` would disconnect all other servers.

Here's a modified version of the program that should work:

```python
def func():
    (n, m, v) = map(int, input().split())
    if m < n - 1:
        print(-1)
        exit()
    
    # Create a star topology with v as the central node
    edges = [(v, i + 1) for i in range(1, n) if i != v]
    m -= len(edges)
    
    # Add remaining edges to reach the required number of edges
    start_node = 1
    while m > 0:
        end_node = start_node + 2
        while m > 0 and end_node < n:
            edges.append((start_node, end_node))
            m -= 1
            end_node += 1
        start_node += 1
    
    if m > 0:
        print(-1)
        exit()
    
    output = ['{} {}'.format(e[0], e[1]) for e in edges]
    print('\n'.join(output))
```

This version ensures that server `v` is a central node in the network, and its failure will disconnect the network.
