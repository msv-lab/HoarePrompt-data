Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where removing server \( v \) causes the system to fail, which is the requirement of the problem. Specifically, the code constructs a linear graph where each server is connected to its immediate neighbor and a few additional connections are added to reach the required number of connections \( m \). However, this construction does not ensure that removing server \( v \) will disconnect the network.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

Input:
```
5 6 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
1 3
3 5
```

This output does not meet the requirement because if server 3 fails, the path between servers 1 and 5 remains intact through the connections (1,3) and (3,5). Therefore, the system would not fail as expected.

The correct approach would involve creating a structure where the removal of server \( v \) breaks at least one path between any two servers. This could be achieved by carefully constructing the graph such that the server \( v \) acts as a critical node for connectivity. The current implementation does not guarantee this behavior for all cases.
