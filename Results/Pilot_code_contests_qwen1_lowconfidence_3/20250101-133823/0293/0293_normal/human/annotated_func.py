#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of switches (N), b is a list of length M, where each element is a sublist containing the connected switches for each bulb and an integer representing the modulo condition (p_i) for that bulb.
def func_1(a, b):
    c = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        c += a[i] * b[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is an integer representing the number of switches (N) and must be greater than 0, `b` is a list of length M where each element is a sublist containing the connected switches for each bulb and an integer representing the modulo condition (p_i) for that bulb, `c` is the sum of `a[i] * b[i][0]` for all `i` in the range of `len(a)`, and `i` is `len(a)` - 1.
    return c
    #The program returns the sum of `a[i] * b[i][0]` for all `i` in the range of `len(a)`, where `i` is `len(a)` - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, an integer representing the number of switches (N), and `b`, a list of sublists where each sublist contains the connected switches for each bulb and an integer representing the modulo condition (p_i) for that bulb. The function calculates the sum of `a[i] * b[i][0]` for all `i` in the range of `len(a)`. The function does not perform any validation on the inputs; it assumes that `a` is a positive integer and `b` is a non-empty list of sublists. If `a` is zero or `b` is an empty list, the function will not handle these cases gracefully. The function returns the computed sum.
