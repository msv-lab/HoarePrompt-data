Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, an integer representing the number of switches (N), and `b`, a list of sublists where each sublist contains the connected switches for each bulb and an integer representing the modulo condition (p_i) for that bulb. The function calculates the sum of `a[i] * b[i][0]` for all `i` in the range of `len(a)`. The function does not perform any validation on the inputs; it assumes that `a` is a positive integer and `b` is a non-empty list of sublists. If `a` is zero or `b` is an empty list, the function will not handle these cases gracefully. The function returns the computed sum.**
