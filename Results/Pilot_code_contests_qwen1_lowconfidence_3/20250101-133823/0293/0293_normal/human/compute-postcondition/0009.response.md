The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is an integer representing the number of switches (N), and `b`, which is a list of length M, where each element is a sublist containing the connected switches for each bulb and an integer representing the modulo condition (p_i) for that bulb. The function returns the sum of `a[i] * b[i][0]` for all `i` in the range of `len(a)`, where `i` is `len(a)` - 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `a` and a list `b`, and return the sum of `a[i] * b[i][0]` for all `i` in the range of `len(a)`, where `i` is `len(a)` - 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `a` (an integer) and a parameter `b` (a list of sublists), and returns the sum of `a[i] * b[i][0]` for all `i` in the range of `len(a)`, where `i` is `len(a)` - 1.**
