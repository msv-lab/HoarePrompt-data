`c` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `a` and the list `b` remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is an integer representing the number of switches (N), `b` is a list of length M where each element is a sublist containing the connected switches for each bulb and an integer representing the modulo condition (p_i) for that bulb, `c` is 0.**
