The code `c += a[i] * b[i]` updates the value of `c` by adding `a[i] * b[i]` to its current value. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

- Initially, `c` is calculated as `a[0] * b[0][0] + a[1] * b[1][0]`.
- The value of `i` is 2.
- The updated value of `c` is now `c + a[2] * b[2][0]`.

Since `a` is an integer representing the number of switches and `b` is a list of sublists where each sublist contains connected switches and a modulo condition, and `i` is set to 2, we can calculate the new value of `c` as follows:

1. The initial value of `c` is `a[0] * b[0][0] + a[1] * b[1][0]`.
2. Adding `a[2] * b[2][0]` to `c`.

Therefore, the new value of `c` is `a[0] * b[0][0] + a[1] * b[1][0] + a[2] * b[2][0]`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer representing the number of switches and must be greater than 0; `b` is a list of length M where each element is a sublist containing the connected switches for each bulb and an integer representing the modulo condition (p_i) for that bulb; `c` is `a[0] * b[0][0] + a[1] * b[1][0] + a[2] * b[2][0]; `i` is 3**
