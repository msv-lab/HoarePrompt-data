`c` is updated by adding `a[i] * b[i]` to its current value. Initially, `c` is 0 and `i` is 0. So, `c` becomes `a[0] * b[0][0]`.

The values of `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer representing the number of switches (N) and must be greater than 0, `b` is a list of length M where each element is a sublist containing the connected switches for each bulb and an integer representing the modulo condition (p_i) for that bulb, `c` is `a[0] * b[0][0]`, and `i` is 0.**
