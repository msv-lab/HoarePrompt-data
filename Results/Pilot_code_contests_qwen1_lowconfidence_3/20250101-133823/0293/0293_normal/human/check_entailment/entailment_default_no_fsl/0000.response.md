Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function is incorrectly defined. It should take two lists as arguments, where the first list represents the state of the switches (`b`) and the second list represents the connections for a particular bulb (`a`). However, the current implementation of `func_1` is flawed in several ways:

1. The function takes two parameters, but the first parameter is supposed to be the state of the switches (`b`), which is a list of binary values indicating whether each switch is on or off. The second parameter is supposed to be the connections for a particular bulb (`a`), which is a list of indices of the switches that control the bulb.

2. The function calculates the sum of `a[i] * b[i]` for all `i` in the range of `len(a)`. This calculation does not match the problem description, which requires the sum to be checked against the modulo condition (`p_i`).

3. The function does not properly handle the modulo condition. The problem description states that the bulb is lighted when the number of switches that are "on" among the connected switches is congruent to `p_i` modulo 2. The current implementation simply returns the sum without checking the modulo condition.

To fix this, the `func_1` function should be updated to check if the sum of the product of the switch states and their corresponding connection weights is congruent to `p_i` modulo 2. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    c = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        c += a[i] * b[i]
    return c % 2 == a[-1]  # Check if the sum is congruent to a[-1] (p_i) modulo 2
```

With this correction, the program should be able to correctly determine the number of combinations of "on" and "off" states of the switches that light all the bulbs.
