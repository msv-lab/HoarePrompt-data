Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in the `func_1` function. The function should compute the dot product of two lists `a` and `b`, but it sums the products instead. This means it will not correctly count the number of switches that are "on" among the specified switches for each bulb.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2 2
2 1 2
1 2
1 0
```

The expected output is 1 because there is only one combination of switch states that lights all the bulbs. However, due to the incorrect implementation of `func_1`, the program may not produce the correct result.

Here's a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    c = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == 1 and b[i] == 1:
            c += 1
    return c % 2
```

This function correctly counts the number of switches that are "on" among the specified switches for each bulb and checks if this count is congruent to \( p_i \) modulo 2.
