Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in how it checks if the current switch configuration lights up all the bulbs. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the dot product of the switch configuration and the connection pattern but does not consider the modulo condition correctly. 

Here's an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
2 2
2 1 2
1 2
0 1
```

According to the problem description, bulb 1 is lit if exactly 0 (modulo 2) of its connected switches are on, and bulb 2 is lit if exactly 1 (modulo 2) of its connected switches are on. Since both bulbs are connected to both switches, we need to check all possible switch configurations.

However, the program only checks if the dot product of the switch configuration and the connection pattern is equal to the required modulo value without considering all possible combinations. This leads to incorrect results. For example, the program might miss some valid configurations where all bulbs are lit.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that for each bulb, the number of "on" switches in its connected switches is equal to the required modulo value. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.
