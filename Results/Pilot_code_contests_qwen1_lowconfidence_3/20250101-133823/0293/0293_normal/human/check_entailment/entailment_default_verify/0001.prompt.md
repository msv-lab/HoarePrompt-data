You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have N switches with "on" and "off" state, and M bulbs. The switches are numbered 1 to N, and the bulbs are numbered 1 to M.

Bulb i is connected to k_i switches: Switch s_{i1}, s_{i2}, ..., and s_{ik_i}. It is lighted when the number of switches that are "on" among these switches is congruent to p_i modulo 2.

How many combinations of "on" and "off" states of the switches light all the bulbs?

Constraints

* 1 \leq N, M \leq 10
* 1 \leq k_i \leq N
* 1 \leq s_{ij} \leq N
* s_{ia} \neq s_{ib} (a \neq b)
* p_i is 0 or 1.
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M
k_1 s_{11} s_{12} ... s_{1k_1}
:
k_M s_{M1} s_{M2} ... s_{Mk_M}
p_1 p_2 ... p_M


Output

Print the number of combinations of "on" and "off" states of the switches that light all the bulbs.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in how it checks if the current switch configuration lights up all the bulbs. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the dot product of the switch configuration and the connection pattern but does not consider the modulo condition correctly. 

Here's an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
2 2
2 1 2
1 2
0 1
```

According to the problem description, bulb 1 is lit if exactly 0 (modulo 2) of its connected switches are on, and bulb 2 is lit if exactly 1 (modulo 2) of its connected switches are on. Since both bulbs are connected to both switches, we need to check all possible switch configurations.

However, the program only checks if the dot product of the switch configuration and the connection pattern is equal to the required modulo value without considering all possible combinations. This leads to incorrect results. For example, the program might miss some valid configurations where all bulbs are lit.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that for each bulb, the number of "on" switches in its connected switches is equal to the required modulo value. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, an integer representing the number of switches (N), and `b`, a list of sublists where each sublist contains the connected switches for each bulb and an integer representing the modulo condition (p_i) for that bulb. The function calculates the sum of `a[i] * b[i][0]` for all `i` in the range of `len(a)`. The function does not perform any validation on the inputs; it assumes that `a` is a positive integer and `b` is a non-empty list of sublists. If `a` is zero or `b` is an empty list, the function will not handle these cases gracefully. The function returns the computed sum.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
