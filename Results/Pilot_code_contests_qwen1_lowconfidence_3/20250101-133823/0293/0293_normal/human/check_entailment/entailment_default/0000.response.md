Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not fully implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to calculate the dot product of two lists, but it does not handle the constraints and conditions specified in the problem description correctly.

Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `a` and `b`.
   - `a` is supposed to represent the state of the switches (0 or 1).
   - `b` is supposed to be a list of sublists, where each sublist contains the indices of the switches connected to a bulb and the modulo condition (`p_i`).

   However, the implementation of `func_1` does not properly account for the modulo condition (`p_i`). It simply calculates the sum of the elements in `b` multiplied by the corresponding elements in `a`, without checking if the result matches the modulo condition.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Filtering Valid Switch States:**
   - The program constructs the `plist` list, which contains binary representations of the switch states that would light each bulb.
   - The program then iterates over all possible switch states (represented by `slist`) and filters those that satisfy the conditions for each bulb.
   - However, the filtering logic does not correctly check if the number of "on" switches for each bulb matches the modulo condition (`p_i`).

To fix these issues, the program needs to correctly implement the logic for checking the modulo condition for each bulb and ensure that the switch states are filtered accordingly.

For example, consider the following test case:

```
Input:
5 2
3 1 2 5
2 2 3
1 0

Expected Output:
8
```

The program does not produce the correct output because it does not properly filter the switch states based on the modulo condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
