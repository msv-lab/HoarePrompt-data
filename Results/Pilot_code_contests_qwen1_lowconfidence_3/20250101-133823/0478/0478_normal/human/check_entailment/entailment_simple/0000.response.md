Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not properly handle the swapping of digits based on their parity. Here’s why:

1. **Parity Swapping Logic**: The problem requires swapping adjacent digits if they have different parities (one is even and the other is odd). However, the current implementation simply separates the digits into `even_digits` and `odd_digits` deques and then tries to form the smallest possible number by alternately picking digits from these deques. This approach does not guarantee that the digits are swapped based on their adjacency in the original number.

2. **Adjacent Digits Handling**: The program should focus on maintaining the relative order of adjacent digits and swapping them if necessary to achieve the smallest possible number. The current approach fails to consider the actual position of the digits and only focuses on their parity.

To correct this, the program needs to:
- Iterate through the string and check if swapping adjacent digits (based on their parity) results in a smaller number.
- Ensure that the swapping logic respects the adjacency constraint and continues until no further swaps can reduce the number.

Here’s a more accurate approach to solve the problem:

```python
def func_2(num):
    digits = list(num)
    n = len(digits)
    
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if (digits[i] % 2 != digits[i + 1] % 2) and (int(digits[i]) > int(digits[i + 1])):
            digits[i], digits[i + 1] = digits[i + 1], digits[i]
    
    return ''.join(digits)

# Example usage:
if not DEBUG:
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        s = input()
        print(func_2(s))
else:
    for test in ['246432', '2464321', '264721', '999999992222222', '7772648', '737572464282', '12', '21', '221', '221']:
        print(func_2(test))
```

This revised approach iterates through the digits and swaps adjacent ones if they have different parities and the swap would result in a smaller number. This ensures that the logic respects the adjacency and parity constraints described in the problem statement.
