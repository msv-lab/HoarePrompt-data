Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not handle the case where we need to swap adjacent digits of different parity to minimize the integer. Instead, it separates the digits into even and odd queues and tries to reconstruct the number by always taking the smallest available digit from either queue, which does not guarantee the minimum possible integer.

For example, consider the input `246432`. The expected output is `234642`, but the current implementation might not produce this result because it does not properly handle the adjacency constraint and the minimization process.

To fix this, the code needs to maintain the original order of digits while ensuring that adjacent digits of different parity are swapped to minimize the integer. This involves a more complex algorithm that keeps track of the best possible swaps to achieve the minimum value.
