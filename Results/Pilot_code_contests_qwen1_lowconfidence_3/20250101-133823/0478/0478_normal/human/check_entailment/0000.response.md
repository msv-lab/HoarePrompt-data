Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum integer by swapping adjacent digits of different parity. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not handle the case where all digits of one parity (either even or odd) come before the other. This leads to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

For example, consider the input `1024`. The expected output should be `0124`, but the current implementation will not produce this result because it does not properly manage the ordering of digits when one parity group comes before the other.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the current implementation fails:

1. **Digit Grouping**: The digits are correctly separated into even and odd digits.
2. **Reordering**: The digits are then appended alternately from the dequeues of even and odd digits. However, if all even or all odd digits come first, the reordering will not produce the minimum possible integer.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the smallest available even digit is always placed before the smallest available odd digit, and so on, until all digits are placed. This requires maintaining a priority order for the smallest available digits of each parity.

A corrected approach could involve sorting the digits based on their parity and value, and then constructing the final string accordingly. Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of how this could be done:

```python
def func_2(num):
    num = [int(x) for x in num]
    even_digits = sorted((d for d in num if d % 2 == 0))
    odd_digits = sorted((d for d in num if d % 2 != 0))
    
    ret = []
    for _ in range(len(num)):
        if even_digits and (not odd_digits or even_digits[0] < odd_digits[0]):
            ret.append(even_digits.pop(0))
        else:
            ret.append(odd_digits.pop(0))
    
    return ''.join(map(str, ret))
```

This corrected function ensures that the smallest available even and odd digits are always placed in the correct order to form the minimum possible integer.
