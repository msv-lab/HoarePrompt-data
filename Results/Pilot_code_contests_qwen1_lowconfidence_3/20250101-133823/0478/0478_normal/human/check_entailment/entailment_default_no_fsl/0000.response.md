Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not correctly separate and rearrange the digits based on their parity. Instead of constructing the minimum possible integer by swapping adjacent digits of different parity, the function simply separates the digits into two deques (one for even and one for odd) and then iterates through these deques without considering adjacency constraints. This leads to an incorrect result in many cases.

For example, consider the input "246432":
- The function separates the digits into even and odd deques as follows:
  - Even: [2, 4, 6, 2]
  - Odd: [4, 3]
- Then it constructs the result by taking the smallest available digit from either deque:
  - Result: "223446"
This is not the minimum possible integer that can be obtained by swapping adjacent digits of different parity.

The correct approach would involve iterating through the digits and swapping adjacent digits if they have different parity until no more swaps can be made. This ensures that the minimum possible integer is achieved.
