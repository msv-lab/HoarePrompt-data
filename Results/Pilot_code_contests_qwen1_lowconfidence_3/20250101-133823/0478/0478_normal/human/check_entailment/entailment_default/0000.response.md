Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_2` does not implement the logic correctly for the given problem description. Specifically, the function constructs a new list `ret` by iterating through the original number of positions, appending the smallest available digit from either the even or odd deque at each step. However, this approach does not ensure that the resulting integer is the minimum possible integer that can be obtained by swapping adjacent digits of different parity. 

To achieve the minimum possible integer, we need to sort the digits such that all even digits come before all odd digits while maintaining their relative order within their parity groups. The current implementation simply alternates between taking the smallest even and the smallest odd digit, which does not guarantee the minimum integer.

For example, consider the input `246432`. The correct output should be `234642` by sorting the even and odd digits separately and then merging them back. However, the current function will produce `234642` after sorting, but it does not account for the fact that the digits should be placed in the correct relative order within their parity groups.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for every potential case and hence the correctness is **False**.
