Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the `func_2` function always returns an empty string, regardless of the input. This is because the logic inside the for loop always removes elements from the deques until both are empty, resulting in an empty list `ret`.

To illustrate this, consider the input "246432". According to the problem description, the goal is to perform swaps of adjacent digits with different parities to minimize the integer. However, the current implementation does not actually perform these swaps and instead constructs an empty string, which is not a valid minimization of the integer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why this happens:

1. `num = [(ord(x) - ord('0')) for x in num]` converts the string to a list of integers.
2. `even_digits` and `odd_digits` are initialized as deques.
3. The for loop iterates over the length of `num`, but since both deques become empty by the time the loop starts, `ret` remains empty.
4. The function returns an empty string, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that it correctly performs the swaps and constructs the minimized integer. Hereâ€™s an updated version of `func_2` that should work as intended:

```python
def func_2(num):
    num = [(ord(x) - ord('0')) for x in num]
    even_digits, odd_digits = collections.deque(), collections.deque()
    for digit in num:
        if digit & 1 == 0:
            even_digits.append(digit)
        else:
            odd_digits.append(digit)
    
    ret = []
    for _ in range(len(num)):
        if not odd_digits or (even_digits and even_digits[0] < odd_digits[0]):
            ret.append(str(even_digits.popleft()))
        else:
            ret.append(str(odd_digits.popleft()))
    
    return ''.join(ret)
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should correctly perform the necessary swaps and return the minimized integer.
