Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided output hints, the original assessment is accurate. The output hints clearly indicate that the function `func_2` does not work as intended. Specifically, the hints mention that the function constructs an empty string instead of forming the minimum possible integer. This behavior is a direct result of the logic flaw in the function, which does not correctly manage the ordering of even and odd digits to produce the minimum integer. The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not meet the problem requirements, as evidenced by the failure to generate the expected output even in simple cases like `1024`, where the expected output is `0124`.
