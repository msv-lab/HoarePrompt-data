Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the required behavior. Specifically, the function separates digits into even and odd deques and always appends the smallest available digit from either deque at each step. This approach does not take into account the adjacency constraint (i.e., only adjacent digits of different parity can be swapped). As a result, the function does not ensure that the minimum possible integer is achieved by properly handling the swaps.

The output hints further confirm this issue. They state that the function constructs a new list `ret` by always appending the smaller digit from the non-empty deque, which results in both deques becoming empty before the loop completes. This behavior indicates that the function does not correctly simulate the allowed swaps and instead simply sorts the digits by parity without respecting the adjacency constraint.

Given these observations, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and thus the final assessment remains **False**.
