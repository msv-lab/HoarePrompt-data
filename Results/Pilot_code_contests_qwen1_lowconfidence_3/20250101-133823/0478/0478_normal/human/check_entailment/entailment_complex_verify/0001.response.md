Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, it does not handle the adjacency constraint and the minimization process correctly. 

- The function separates the digits into even and odd queues but does not ensure that adjacent digits of different parity are swapped to form the minimum integer. Instead, it always takes the smallest available digit from either the even or odd deque, which does not guarantee the minimum possible integer.
- For example, considering the input `246432`, the expected output is `234642`, but the current implementation might not produce this result because it does not properly handle the adjacency constraint and the minimization process.

Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is accurate. The provided code fails to meet the requirements of the problem description as it does not correctly minimize the integer by swapping adjacent digits of different parity.
