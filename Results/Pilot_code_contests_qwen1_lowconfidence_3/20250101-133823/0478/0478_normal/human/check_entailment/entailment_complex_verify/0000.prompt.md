You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a huge integer a consisting of n digits (n is between 1 and 3 ⋅ 10^5, inclusive). It may contain leading zeros.

You can swap two digits on adjacent (neighboring) positions if the swapping digits are of different parity (that is, they have different remainders when divided by 2). 

For example, if a = 032867235 you can get the following integers in a single operation: 

  * 302867235 if you swap the first and the second digits; 
  * 023867235 if you swap the second and the third digits; 
  * 032876235 if you swap the fifth and the sixth digits; 
  * 032862735 if you swap the sixth and the seventh digits; 
  * 032867325 if you swap the seventh and the eighth digits. 



Note, that you can't swap digits on positions 2 and 4 because the positions are not adjacent. Also, you can't swap digits on positions 3 and 4 because the digits have the same parity.

You can perform any number (possibly, zero) of such operations.

Find the minimum integer you can obtain.

Note that the resulting integer also may contain leading zeros.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases in the input.

The only line of each test case contains the integer a, its length n is between 1 and 3 ⋅ 10^5, inclusive.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all values n does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case print line — the minimum integer you can obtain.

Example

Input


3
0709
1337
246432


Output


0079
1337
234642

Note

In the first test case, you can perform the following sequence of operations (the pair of swapped digits is highlighted): 0 \underline{70} 9 → 0079.

In the second test case, the initial integer is optimal. 

In the third test case you can perform the following sequence of operations: 246 \underline{43} 2 → 24 \underline{63}42 → 2 \underline{43} 642 → 234642.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum integer by swapping adjacent digits of different parity. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not handle the case where all digits of one parity (either even or odd) come before the other. This leads to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

For example, consider the input `1024`. The expected output should be `0124`, but the current implementation will not produce this result because it does not properly manage the ordering of digits when one parity group comes before the other.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the current implementation fails:

1. **Digit Grouping**: The digits are correctly separated into even and odd digits.
2. **Reordering**: The digits are then appended alternately from the dequeues of even and odd digits. However, if all even or all odd digits come first, the reordering will not produce the minimum possible integer.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the smallest available even digit is always placed before the smallest available odd digit, and so on, until all digits are placed. This requires maintaining a priority order for the smallest available digits of each parity.

A corrected approach could involve sorting the digits based on their parity and value, and then constructing the final string accordingly. Here’s a conceptual outline of how this could be done:

```python
def func_2(num):
    num = [int(x) for x in num]
    even_digits = sorted((d for d in num if d % 2 == 0))
    odd_digits = sorted((d for d in num if d % 2 != 0))
    
    ret = []
    for _ in range(len(num)):
        if even_digits and (not odd_digits or even_digits[0] < odd_digits[0]):
            ret.append(even_digits.pop(0))
        else:
            ret.append(odd_digits.pop(0))
    
    return ''.join(map(str, ret))
```

This corrected function ensures that the smallest available even and odd digits are always placed in the correct order to form the minimum possible integer.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Additionally, if the key `'flush'` was popped from `kwargs` with a value of `True`, the internal buffer of `file` is flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a number of test cases (denoted by `t`), where each test case involves a string `a` representing a huge integer with up to 300,000 digits, potentially containing leading zeros. The function concatenates the string representations of multiple arguments (`args`) separated by a specified separator (`sep`), and writes the result to an output stream (`file`). If the keyword argument `end` is provided, it appends this value to the end of the concatenated string before writing it to the stream. If the keyword argument `flush` is set to `True`, the internal buffer of the output stream is flushed. Leading zeros in the input string `a` are preserved during the concatenation process.

    return ''.join(map(str, ret))
    #The program returns an empty string since 'ret' is an empty list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `num` representing a huge integer consisting of `n` digits (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5), where each character in the string is a digit from '0' to '9'. It processes the digits by separating them into two deques: one for even digits and one for odd digits. Then, it constructs a new list `ret` by iterating through the original number of positions, appending the smallest available digit from either the even or odd deque at each step. After processing, the function returns an empty string since the `ret` list ends up being empty. This behavior is due to the logic that always prefers to append the smaller digit from the non-empty deque, which results in both deques becoming empty before the loop completes.
