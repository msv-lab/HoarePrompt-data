Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The annotated version clarifies that the current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly reorder the digits to form the minimum possible integer. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` does not handle the case where all even or all odd digits come first. As a result, the function does not produce the correct minimum integer for certain inputs.

For example, consider the input `1024`. The expected output should be `0124`, but the current implementation will not produce this result because it does not properly manage the ordering of digits when one parity group comes before the other. The annotated version shows that the function always prefers to take the smallest available digit from either the even or odd deque, which can lead to incorrect results in some cases. Therefore, the original assessment remains correct.
