Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The provided `func_2` function does not correctly reorder the digits to form the minimum possible integer. Specifically, the function does not handle the case where all even or all odd digits come first, which leads to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

For example, consider the input `1024`. The expected output should be `0124`, but the current implementation will not produce this result because it does not properly manage the ordering of digits when one parity group comes before the other. The annotated version shows that the function appends digits alternately from deques of even and odd digits, which does not guarantee the minimum possible integer in all cases.

The provided solution in the original assessment highlights this issue and suggests a corrected approach where digits are sorted based on their parity and value to ensure the smallest available even and odd digits are always placed in the correct order. The annotated version supports this conclusion by showing that the current implementation does not achieve this goal.
