The code `odd_digits.append(digit)` appends the `digit` to the `odd_digits` deque. Since `odd_digits` was initially an empty deque and the first digit of any number in `num` is odd, the `digit` being appended is odd. However, the specific value of `digit` is not provided, so we will keep it as `digit`.

Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `even_digits` is an empty deque, `odd_digits` contains the digit, the first digit of any number in `num` is odd**
