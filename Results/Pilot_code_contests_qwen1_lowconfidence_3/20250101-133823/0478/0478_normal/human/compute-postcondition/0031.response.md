Postcondition: ***`odd_digits` and `even_digits` are lists of integers. `ret` is a list containing either the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits`, and `ret` has gained the first element of `even_digits` if `even_digits[0] < odd_digits[0]` or the first element of `odd_digits` otherwise.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts. It ensures that the conditions from both parts are accounted for in the final state of the variables.
