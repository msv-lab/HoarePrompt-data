`ret` appends the first element of `even_digits` after removing it using `popleft`. The length of `num` is reduced by 1, but the exact value of `num` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the new length. The state of `odd_digits` is unchanged, and the state of `ret` is updated by adding the first element of `even_digits`.

Output State: **`odd_digits` is a list of integers; `even_digits` is a list of integers with its first element removed; `ret` is a list containing the first element of `even_digits`; `len(num)` is reduced by 1 from its previous value.**
