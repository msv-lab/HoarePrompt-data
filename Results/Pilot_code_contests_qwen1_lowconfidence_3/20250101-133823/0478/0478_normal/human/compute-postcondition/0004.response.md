The code appends the current digit to the `even_digits` deque. Since the current value of the digit being processed is even, this digit will be appended to `even_digits`. The `odd_digits` deque remains unchanged, and the `num` list and the state of the digit being processed are also unaffected.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `even_digits` is a deque with at least one even digit and now includes the current digit, `odd_digits` is an empty deque, the current value of the digit being processed is even**
