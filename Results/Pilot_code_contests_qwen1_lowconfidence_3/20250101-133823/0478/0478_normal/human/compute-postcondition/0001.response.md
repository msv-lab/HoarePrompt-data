The code initializes two deques, `even_digits` and `odd_digits`. These deques are empty and do not affect the values of the elements in the original `num` list. Therefore, the only change is the creation of these two deques.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, where each integer is the numeric value of each digit in the original string `num`; `even_digits` is an empty deque; `odd_digits` is an empty deque.**
