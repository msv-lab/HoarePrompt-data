Postcondition: **`odd_digits` and `even_digits` are lists of integers, `ret` is a list containing either the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits`, and `len(num)` is reduced by 1 from its previous value. Specifically, if `even_digits` is empty or the first element of `even_digits` is less than the first element of `odd_digits`, then `ret` contains the first element of `even_digits` and `even_digits` has its first element removed. Otherwise, `ret` contains the first element of `odd_digits` and `odd_digits` has its first element removed.**
