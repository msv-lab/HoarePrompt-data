According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digit` and the lists `even_digits` and `odd_digits`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a list of integers, `even_digits` is a deque containing either at least one even digit from the list or is empty, and `odd_digits` contains either the current odd digit or is empty. The digit being processed is either added to `even_digits` if it is even, or to `odd_digits` if it is odd.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. **The next digit in `num`**: Since the loop processes each digit in `num`, the next digit in the list `num` will be processed in the next iteration.
2. **`even_digits` and `odd_digits`**: The state of these deques will depend on whether the next digit is even or odd.

At the end of the last iteration, the digit being processed is either even or odd. Therefore, for the next iteration:

- If the next digit is even, it will be added to `even_digits`.
- If the next digit is odd, it will be added to `odd_digits`.

Since we don't know the exact value of the next digit, we can only state the conditions under which the loop will continue.

State: **`num` is a list of integers, `even_digits` is a deque containing either at least one even digit from the list or is empty (depending on the next digit being even), and `odd_digits` contains either the current odd digit or is empty (depending on the next digit being odd). The digit being processed is either added to `even_digits` if it is even, or to `odd_digits` if it is odd.**
