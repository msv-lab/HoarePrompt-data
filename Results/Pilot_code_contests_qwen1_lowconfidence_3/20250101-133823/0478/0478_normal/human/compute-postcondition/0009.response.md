The code `even_digits.append(digit)` appends the `digit` to the `even_digits` deque. This means that if the `digit` is even, it will be added to the `even_digits` deque. The `odd_digits` deque remains unchanged since no operation was performed on it. The `num` list also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `even_digits` is a deque containing at least one more even digit from the list, and `odd_digits` contains either the current odd digit or is still empty (depending on the next digit being odd).**
