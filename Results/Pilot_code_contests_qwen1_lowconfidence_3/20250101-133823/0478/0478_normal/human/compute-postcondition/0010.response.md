The code appends the `digit` to the `odd_digits` deque. According to the initial state, `odd_digits` contains either the current odd digit or is empty (depending on the next digit being odd). After appending the `digit`, if the `digit` is odd, `odd_digits` will now contain this digit.

The states of the other variables (`num` and `even_digits`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `even_digits` is a deque containing either at least one even digit from the list or is empty, and `odd_digits` now contains the current odd digit.**
