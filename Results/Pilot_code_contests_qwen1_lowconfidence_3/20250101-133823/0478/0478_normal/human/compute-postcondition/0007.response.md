Postcondition: ***`num` is a list of integers, `even_digits` is a deque containing either at least one even digit from the list or is empty, and `odd_digits` contains either the current odd digit or is empty. The digit being processed is either added to `even_digits` if it is even, or to `odd_digits` if it is odd.***
