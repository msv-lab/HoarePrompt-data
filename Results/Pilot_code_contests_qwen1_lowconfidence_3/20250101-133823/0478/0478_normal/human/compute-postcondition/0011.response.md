Postcondition: **`num` is a list of integers, `even_digits` is a deque containing either at least one even digit from the list or is empty, and `odd_digits` contains either the current odd digit or is empty. After processing the digit, if the digit is even, `even_digits` contains at least one more even digit from the list; otherwise, `odd_digits` contains the current odd digit.**
