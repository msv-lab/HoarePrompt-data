The code initializes an empty list `ret`. This does not affect the values of `num`, `even_digits`, or `odd_digits`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `even_digits` is a deque containing all the even digits from the list `num`, and `odd_digits` is a deque containing all the odd digits from the list `num`; `ret` is an empty list.**
