The code `ret.append(even_digits.popleft())` impacts the following variables:
- `ret`: It appends the first element of `even_digits` to itself.
- `even_digits`: It removes and returns the first element of the list `even_digits`.

Since `ret` initially contains either the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits`, after appending the first element of `even_digits`, `ret` will now contain the first two elements of `even_digits`. The length of `even_digits` will be reduced by one.

Output State: **`odd_digits` is a list of integers, `even_digits` is a list of integers with its first element removed, `ret` is a list containing the first element of `even_digits` and the previous first element of `ret`, and `len(num)` is greater than 0**
