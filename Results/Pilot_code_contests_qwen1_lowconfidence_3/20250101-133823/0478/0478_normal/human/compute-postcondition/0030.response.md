`ret` appends the first element of `odd_digits` to itself, which means `ret` gains a new element while `odd_digits` loses its first element. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `odd_digits` is a list of integers without its first element, `even_digits` is a list of integers, `ret` contains either the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits`, and `ret` has gained the first element of `odd_digits`. 

Output State: **`odd_digits` is a list of integers without its first element, `even_digits` is a list of integers, `ret` contains either the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits`, and `ret` has gained the first element of `odd_digits`.**
