According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. The loop will execute if the list `num` contains at least one element.

Before the loop starts, the state is as follows:
- `num` is a list of integers where each integer is the numeric value of each digit in the original string `num`.
- `even_digits` is an empty deque.
- `odd_digits` is an empty deque.

For the loop to execute, `num` must contain at least one element. We need to ensure this condition is met.

State: **`num` is a list of integers (must contain at least one element), `even_digits` is an empty deque, `odd_digits` is an empty deque**
