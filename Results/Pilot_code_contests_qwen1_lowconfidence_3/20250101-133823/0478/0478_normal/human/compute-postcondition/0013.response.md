`even_digits.append(digit)` appends the `digit` to the `even_digits` deque. This operation does not affect the value of `num`, and the state of `odd_digits` remains unchanged because no operations were performed on it.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `num` remains as a list of integers.
- `even_digits` now contains at least one more even digit (the `digit` appended).
- `odd_digits` remains either containing the next odd digit or being empty.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `even_digits` is a deque containing at least one more even digit than before, and `odd_digits` contains either the next odd digit or is empty.**
