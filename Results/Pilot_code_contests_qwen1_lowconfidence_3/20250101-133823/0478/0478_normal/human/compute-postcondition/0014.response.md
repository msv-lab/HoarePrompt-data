`odd_digits` appends the `digit` to its end. The value of `num` remains unchanged as no operation is performed on it. The value of `even_digits` remains unchanged unless the appended `digit` is even, in which case it would be moved from `odd_digits` to `even_digits`. However, since the problem states that `odd_digits` may be empty, we assume that appending an odd digit does not affect `even_digits`.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `even_digits` is a deque containing either at least one even digit from the list or is empty, and `odd_digits` now contains the next odd digit or is still empty if it was already empty.**
