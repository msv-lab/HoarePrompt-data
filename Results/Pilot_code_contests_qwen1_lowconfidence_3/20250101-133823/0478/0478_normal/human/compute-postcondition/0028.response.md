Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `odd_digits` and `even_digits` are lists of integers.
   - `ret` is a list containing either the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits`.
   - `len(num)` is reduced by 1 from its previous value.

2. **Conditions for Adding Elements to `ret`:**
   - If `even_digits` is empty or the first element of `even_digits` is less than the first element of `odd_digits`, then `ret` contains the first element of `even_digits` and `even_digits` has its first element removed.
   - Otherwise, `ret` contains the first element of `odd_digits` and `odd_digits` has its first element removed.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `len(num)` times, reducing `len(num)` by 1 each time an iteration completes.

4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
     - `odd_digits` and `even_digits` are lists of integers.
     - `ret` contains either the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits`.
     - `len(num)` has been reduced by 1.

5. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `len(num)` must still be greater than 0.
   - If `even_digits` is not empty and its first element is greater than or equal to the first element of `odd_digits`, `even_digits` will have its first element removed, and `ret` will contain this element.
   - If `even_digits` is empty or its first element is less than the first element of `odd_digits`, `odd_digits` will have its first element removed, and `ret` will contain this element.

6. **Final State:**
   - Since the loop runs `len(num)` times and `len(num)` is reduced by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `len(num)` must be greater than 0.
   - Depending on the condition, either `even_digits` or `odd_digits` will have its first element removed, and `ret` will contain this element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`odd_digits` and `even_digits` are lists of integers, `ret` is a list containing either the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits`, and `len(num)` is greater than 0**.
