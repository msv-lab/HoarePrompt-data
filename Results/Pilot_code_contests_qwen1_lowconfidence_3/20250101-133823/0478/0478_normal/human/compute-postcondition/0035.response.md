Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a string `num` representing a huge integer consisting of `n` digits (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5), where each character in the string is a digit from '0' to '9'. It processes the digits by separating them into two deques: one for even digits and one for odd digits. Then, it constructs a new list `ret` by iterating through the original number of positions, appending the smallest available digit from either the even or odd deque at each step. After processing, the function returns an empty string since the `ret` list ends up being empty. This behavior is due to the logic that always prefers to append the smaller digit from the non-empty deque, which results in both deques becoming empty before the loop completes.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `num` contains only even digits, the function will still prefer to append the smallest even digit at each step, leading to an empty `ret` list.
- If `num` contains only odd digits, the function will prefer to append the smallest odd digit at each step, leading to an empty `ret` list.
- If `num` contains a mix of even and odd digits, the function will alternate between the smallest available even and odd digits until both deques are exhausted, resulting in an empty `ret` list.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not return the constructed list `ret`. Instead, it returns an empty string, which might not align with the intended functionality based on the given postconditions. The postconditions state that the function returns an empty string, but the actual implementation does not create a meaningful output list.
