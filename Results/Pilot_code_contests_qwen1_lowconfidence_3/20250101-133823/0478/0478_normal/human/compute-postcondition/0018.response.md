To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop:

1. **`num` is a list of integers**: This list must exist and contain at least one integer for the loop to execute.

2. **`even_digits` is a deque containing all the even digits from the list `num`**: The presence and content of this deque are not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition.

3. **`odd_digits` is a deque containing all the odd digits from the list `num`**: Similar to `even_digits`, the presence and content of this deque are not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition.

4. **`ret` is an empty list**: The initial state of `ret` is already provided as being empty, and this does not affect the loop's execution.

The loop `for _ in range(len(num)):` requires that the length of the list `num` is at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. Since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to consider what happens inside the loop for determining the initial states.

Thus, the critical state adjustment needed is ensuring that the list `num` has at least one element.

**State:**
**`num` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer, `even_digits` is a deque containing all the even digits from the list `num`, `odd_digits` is a deque containing all the odd digits from the list `num`, `ret` is an empty list**. 

However, since the deques and `ret` do not affect the loop's execution, we can simplify the required state to focus on `num`:

**State:**
**`num` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer**.
