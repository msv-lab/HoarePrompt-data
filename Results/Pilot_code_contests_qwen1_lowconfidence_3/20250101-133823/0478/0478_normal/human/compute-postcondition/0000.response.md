The code `num = [(ord(x) - ord('0')) for x in num]` iterates over each character in the string `num` and converts it to its corresponding integer value using the `ord()` function. The `ord('0')` returns the ASCII value of '0', and subtracting this value from the ASCII value of each character in `num` gives the integer value of the digit.

Given the initial state where `num` is a string representing a huge integer, after executing the code, `num` will be a list of integers, where each integer corresponds to the numeric value of each digit in the original string.

For example, if the initial `num` was "123", the output would be `[1, 2, 3]`.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, where each integer is the numeric value of each digit in the original string `num`.**
