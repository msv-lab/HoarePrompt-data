The code `ret.append(odd_digits.popleft())` impacts the following:
- It removes the first element from `odd_digits` (let's call this element `first_odd`) and appends it to `ret`.
- The value of `len(num)` is reduced by 1, which is already given in the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `odd_digits` and `even_digits` are lists of integers.
- `ret` is a list containing either the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits`.
- `len(num)` is reduced by 1 from its previous value.

After executing the code:
- The first element of `odd_digits` is removed and appended to `ret`.

Output State: **`odd_digits` is the same list but without its first element; `even_digits` remains unchanged; `ret` contains the first element of `odd_digits` appended to it; `len(num)` is reduced by 1.**
