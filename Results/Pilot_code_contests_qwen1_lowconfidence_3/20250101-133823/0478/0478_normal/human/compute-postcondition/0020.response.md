The code `ret.append(even_digits.popleft())` has the following impacts:

- `even_digits.popleft()` removes and returns the first element from the `even_digits` list.
- This returned value is appended to the `ret` list.

Given the precondition that if `odd_digits` is not empty, then either `even_digits` is empty or the first element of `even_digits` is less than the first element of `odd_digits`, we know that the operation `even_digits.popleft()` can only proceed if `even_digits` is not empty (because if it were empty, the operation would raise an error).

Therefore, after the operation, `ret` will have the first element of `even_digits` appended to it, and the first element will be removed from `even_digits`.

Output State: **`odd_digits` is a list of integers, `even_digits` is a list of integers with its first element removed, `ret` is a list containing the first element of `even_digits`.**
