To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop affects the variables involved.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `odd_digits` and `even_digits` are lists of integers.
   - `ret` is a list containing either the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits`.
   - The condition for `ret` is `not odd_digits or (even_digits and even_digits[0] < odd_digits[0])`.

2. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop iterates over the range of `len(num)`.
   - Inside the loop, some operation is performed on the elements of `num`, but it is omitted here.

3. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - The condition for `ret` is evaluated based on the current states of `odd_digits` and `even_digits`.
   - The loop will execute until it processes all elements of `num`.

4. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - After each iteration, the loop processes one element from `num`.
   - The condition for `ret` will be re-evaluated with the updated states of `odd_digits` and `even_digits`.

5. **Assumptions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, there must be at least one element left in `num` to process.
   - The values of `odd_digits` and `even_digits` will change based on the processing inside the loop.

### Updated State at the Start of the Next Iteration:

Since the exact operations within the loop body are not specified, we can only infer that:
- `odd_digits` and `even_digits` will be updated based on the processing of the next element from `num`.
- `ret` will be reassigned based on the updated states of `odd_digits` and `even_digits`.

However, without knowing the exact operation, we can only say that the length of `num` decreases by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, the loop can continue as long as `len(num)` is greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`odd_digits` and `even_digits` are lists of integers, `ret` is a list containing either the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits`, and `len(num)` is reduced by 1 from its previous value.**

Since the exact values of `odd_digits`, `even_digits`, and `ret` depend on the internal operations, we cannot provide specific values for them. We only know the general state.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
**`odd_digits` and `even_digits` are lists of integers, `ret` is a list containing either the first element of `even_digits` or the first element of `odd_digits`, and `len(num)` is reduced by 1 from its previous value.**
