Output State: **`odd_digits` is an empty deque, `even_digits` is an empty deque, `ret` is a list containing all the elements that were added to it during the loop, and `num` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues until there are no more elements left in the `num` list.
- During each iteration, the loop removes the smallest available digit between the first element of `even_digits` and the first element of `odd_digits` and appends it to `ret`.
- Since the loop removes elements from `even_digits` and `odd_digits` based on the comparison, eventually, both deques will become empty.
- Once `num` becomes empty, the loop terminates, and no further elements are appended to `ret`.

Given that the loop removes elements from `num` and appends them to `ret`, and since `num` is emptied out, `num` will be an empty list by the end of the loop. Similarly, `even_digits` and `odd_digits` will also be empty as all elements are moved to `ret`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state is that `odd_digits` and `even_digits` are empty deques, `ret` contains all the digits from `num` in the order they were appended, and `num` is an empty list.
