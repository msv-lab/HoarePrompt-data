The function `func_2` accepts a string `num` representing a huge integer consisting of `n` digits (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5), where each character in the string is a digit from '0' to '9'. It processes the digits by separating them into two deques: one for even digits and one for odd digits. Then, it constructs a new list `ret` by iterating through the original number of positions, appending the smallest available digit from either the even or odd deque at each step. After processing, the function returns an empty string since the `ret` list ends up being empty. This behavior is due to the logic that always prefers to append the smaller digit from the non-empty deque, which results in both deques becoming empty before the loop completes.
