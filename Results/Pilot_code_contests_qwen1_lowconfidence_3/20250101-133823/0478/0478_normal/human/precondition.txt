file is a string representing a filename containing multiple test cases, where each test case is described on a separate line. Each test case starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by t lines, each containing a huge integer a consisting of n digits (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5). The sum of all values n does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
