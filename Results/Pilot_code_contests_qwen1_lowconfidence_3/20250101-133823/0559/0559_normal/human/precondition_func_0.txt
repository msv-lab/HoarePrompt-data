coord1 and coord2 are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) of road squares in the maze, where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W. depth_dict_org is a dictionary mapping each coordinate to its initial depth (distance from the start), graph is a dictionary where keys are coordinates and values are lists of adjacent road square coordinates, and end_coord is the coordinate of the goal square.
