`childs` is appended with the value of `child`. The function does not directly modify the values of `jibun`, `target`, or `used_coords`. The condition for returning 'found' is not met because `child` does not equal `target`. Therefore, the output state is: `jibun` is an integer representing a road square in the maze, `target` is a road square in the maze, `used_coords` includes the current `child`, and `childs` now includes the value of `child`.

Output State: **`jibun` is an integer representing a road square in the maze, `target` is a road square in the maze, `used_coords` includes the current `child`, `childs` includes the value of `child`**
