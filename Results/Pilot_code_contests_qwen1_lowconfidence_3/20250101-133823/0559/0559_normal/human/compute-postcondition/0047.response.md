The code `next_childs += res` appends the elements of `res` to `next_childs`. If `res` equals 'found', the function would return `cur_depth + 1`, but since the condition is not met here, `next_childs` is updated, and `cur_depth` and `used_coords` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`next_childs` is the original `next_childs` with the elements of `res` added to it; `cur_depth` is increased by 2; `used_coords` includes the original `used_coords` plus `childs`**
