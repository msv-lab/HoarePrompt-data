The code `childs = list(set(next_childs))` removes duplicates from `next_childs` and assigns the result to `childs`. However, since the initial value of `next_childs` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values in `childs`. We know that `next_childs` is converted to a set to remove duplicates, and then back to a list.

Output State: **`next_childs` is a list with potential duplicates, `childs` is a list with no duplicates from `next_childs`**
