`cur_depth` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `cur_depth` is not specified. The lists `next_childs` and `childs` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `next_childs` is a list with potential duplicates, `childs` is a list with no duplicates from `next_childs` and must not be empty, `cur_depth` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`next_childs` is a list with potential duplicates, `childs` is a list with no duplicates from `next_childs` and must not be empty, `cur_depth` is increased by 1**
