Postcondition: ***`cur_coord` is the second element of `next_childs`, `cur_depth` is updated to 4 if `res` equals 'found', otherwise, `cur_depth` remains 3, `used_coords` includes `coord1` and the second element of `next_childs`, and `next_childs` is updated based on the current `child` being processed. The return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` is `res`.***
