You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: coord1 and coord2 are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) of road squares in the maze, where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W. depth_dict_org is a dictionary mapping each coordinate to its initial depth (distance from the start), graph is a dictionary where keys are coordinates and values are lists of adjacent road square coordinates, and end_coord is the coordinate of the goal square.
```
def func_1(coord1, coord2):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns 2, given that `cur_depth` is 1 and the function `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` returned 'found', thus `cur_depth + 1` equals 2

Case_2: `The program returns 3, where cur_depth is 2`

Case_3: `The program returns cur_depth which is 3 plus 1, resulting in 4

Case_4: The program returns cur_depth that is increased by 1

Case_5: `The program returns cur_depth which is increased by 1`

Case_6: `The program returns the value of cur_depth which is increased by 2 plus 1`

Case_7: The program returns `cur_depth + 1`, where `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 2

Case_8: `The program returns cur_depth plus 1, where cur_depth is the number of times the loop executed plus 2`

Case_9: `The program returns cur_depth plus 1, where cur_depth is the number of times the loop executed plus 3`

Case_10: The program returns 0

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
