Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `next_childs` is an empty list.
   - `childs` is a list with no duplicates from `next_childs` and must not be empty.
   - `cur_depth` is increased by 1.
   - `used_coords` is the original `used_coords` plus `childs`.

2. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will iterate over each `child` in `childs`.
   - For the loop to execute, `childs` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over `childs`.

3. **State Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `childs` must not be empty for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `childs` contains at least one element.

Given these points, we need to adjust the initial state to reflect the condition that `childs` is not empty.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `next_childs` is an empty list (no change needed as per the problem statement).
- `childs` must not be empty to allow the loop to execute.
- `cur_depth` is increased by 1 (no change needed as per the problem statement).
- `used_coords` is the original `used_coords` plus `childs` (no change needed as per the problem statement).

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`next_childs` is an empty list, `childs` must not be empty, `cur_depth` is increased by 1, `used_coords` is the original `used_coords` plus `childs`**.
