The line `next_childs = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `next_childs`. This operation does not affect the values of `childs`, `cur_depth`, or `used_coords`.

Output State: **`next_childs` is an empty list, `childs` is a list with no duplicate elements from `next_childs`, `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 2, `used_coords` is the original `used_coords` plus all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions.**
