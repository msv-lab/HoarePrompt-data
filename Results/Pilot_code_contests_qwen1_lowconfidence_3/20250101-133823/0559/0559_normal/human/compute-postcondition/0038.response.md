Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop control variables and conditions**: The loop iterates over each element in `childs`. For the loop to execute again, `childs` must not be empty.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `next_childs` is a list containing the elements of `res`.
   - `childs` must not be empty (implying `childs` is non-empty at the start of the current iteration).
   - `cur_depth` is increased by 1.
   - `used_coords` is the original `used_coords` plus `childs`.
   - `res` is not 'found'.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `cur_depth` is increased by 1, it means the depth has increased.
   - `used_coords` includes all elements from `res` and `childs`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `childs` must still be non-empty.

Based on these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `cur_depth` has increased by 1, `used_coords` includes the elements of `res` and `childs`, and `res` remains 'not found'. Additionally, since `childs` is used as the iterable in the loop, it must not be empty for the loop to continue.

Here is the modified state:

State: **`next_childs` is a list containing the elements of `res`, `childs` must not be empty, `cur_depth` is increased by 1, `used_coords` is the original `used_coords` plus `childs`, `res` is not 'found'**
