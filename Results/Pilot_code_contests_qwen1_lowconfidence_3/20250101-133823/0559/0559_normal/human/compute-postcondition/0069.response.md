`next_childs` is assigned the value of `next_childs + res`. This means `next_childs` now contains all its original elements plus the elements of `res`. The variable `cur_depth` is updated to be the number of times the loop executed plus 3. The variable `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice.

Since the code does not affect the condition for returning `cur_depth + 1` when `res` is 'found', the function will still return `cur_depth + 1` if `res` equals 'found'.

Output State: **`next_childs` contains all its original elements plus the elements of `res`, `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 3, `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice, and the function returns `cur_depth + 1` if `res` equals 'found'.**
