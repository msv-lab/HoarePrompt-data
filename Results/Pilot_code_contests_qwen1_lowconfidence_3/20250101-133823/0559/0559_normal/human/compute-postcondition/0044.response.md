`res` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`. The values of `next_childs`, `cur_depth`, and `used_coords` are updated based on their initial states.

- `next_childs` originally contained the elements of `res` added to its original contents. After the assignment, `next_childs` will contain the elements of the new `res` (returned by `func_2`) added to its original contents.
- `cur_depth` was increased by 2 before the function call. This increase remains unchanged after the function call.
- `used_coords` was the original `used_coords` plus `childs`. After the function call, `used_coords` will include the original `used_coords` plus the `childs` that were passed to `func_2`.

Output State: **`next_childs` is the original `next_childs` with the elements of the new `res` added to it; `cur_depth` is increased by 2; `used_coords` includes the original `used_coords` plus `childs`.**
