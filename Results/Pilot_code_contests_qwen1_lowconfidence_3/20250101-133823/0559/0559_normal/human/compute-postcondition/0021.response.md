Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `jibun`, `target`, and `used_coords`. `jibun` represents a road square in the maze, `target` is another road square in the maze, and `used_coords` is a set of tuples representing the coordinates of squares that have already been visited. The function explores the children (adjacent squares) of the given `jibun` to check if any of them match the `target`. If the `target` is found, the function returns `'found'`. If the `target` is not found among the children, the function returns a list of all child nodes that were explored and confirmed not to be in `used_coords`.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- If the `jibun` does not have any children, the function will return a list containing an empty list (since `childs` will be initialized but never appended to).
- If the `graph` dictionary is empty or `jibun` is not a valid key in the `graph`, the function will raise a `KeyError`. However, the code does not handle this case explicitly, which could lead to an unhandled exception.
