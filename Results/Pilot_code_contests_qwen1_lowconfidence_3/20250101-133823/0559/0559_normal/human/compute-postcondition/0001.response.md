According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `graph[jibun]`. For the loop to execute, `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element (i.e., there must be at least one child of `jibun` in the graph). 

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop iterates over each `child` in `graph[jibun]`.
2. For the loop to start executing, `graph[jibun]` must not be an empty list or an empty set, as it needs to have at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `jibun` is an integer representing a road square in the maze.
- `target` is a road square in the maze.
- `used_coords` is a set of tuples representing the coordinates of squares that have already been visited.
- `childs` is an empty list (though this is not directly relevant to the loop condition).

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `graph[jibun]` contains at least one element.

State: **`jibun` is an integer representing a road square in the maze, `target` is a road square in the maze, `used_coords` is a set of tuples representing the coordinates of squares that have already been visited, `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element**.
