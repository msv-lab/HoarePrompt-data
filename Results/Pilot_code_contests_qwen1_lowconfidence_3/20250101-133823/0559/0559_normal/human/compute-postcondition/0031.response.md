`used_coords` is assigned the value of `used_coords + childs`. The initial state is that `next_childs` is an empty list, `childs` is a list with no duplicates from `next_childs` and must not be empty, and `cur_depth` is increased by 1. After the code executes, `used_coords` will contain all elements from its original value plus the elements in `childs`. The values of `next_childs` and `cur_depth` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`next_childs` is an empty list, `childs` is a list with no duplicates from `next_childs` and must not be empty, `cur_depth` is increased by 1, `used_coords` is the original `used_coords` plus `childs`**
