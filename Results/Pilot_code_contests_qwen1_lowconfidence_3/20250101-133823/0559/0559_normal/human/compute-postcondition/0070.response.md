Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.

### Initial State:
- `next_childs` is an empty list.
- `childs` is a list with no duplicate elements from `next_childs`.
- `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 2.
- `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice.

### Loop Code:
```python
for child in childs:
    res = func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)
    if res == 'found':
        return cur_depth + 1
    next_childs += res
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - Initially, `next_childs` is empty, `childs` contains some initial elements, and `cur_depth` starts from 2 (since it is the number of times the loop has executed plus 2).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `child` in `childs`, `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` is called.
   - The result `res` is appended to `next_childs`.
   - If `res` is `'found'`, the function returns `cur_depth + 1`, breaking out of the loop.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop finishes, `next_childs` will contain all the original elements plus the elements returned by `func_2` for each iteration.
   - `childs` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `cur_depth` will be the total number of iterations the loop executed plus 2.
   - `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice.

4. **Return Condition**:
   - If the loop exits because `res` is `'found'`, the function returns `cur_depth + 1`.
   - If the loop completes without finding `'found'`, the function returns `cur_depth + 1` after the last iteration.

### Final Output State:
- `next_childs` will contain all the original elements plus the elements returned by `func_2` for each iteration.
- `childs` remains unchanged.
- `cur_depth` is the total number of iterations the loop executed plus 2.
- `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice.

### Conclusion:
- If the loop does not find `'found'`, it will return `cur_depth + 1` where `cur_depth` is the total number of iterations plus 2.
- If the loop finds `'found'`, it will return `cur_depth + 1` where `cur_depth` is the number of iterations when `'found'` was found plus 2.

Output State: **`next_childs` contains all its original elements plus the elements of `res` for each iteration, `childs` is a list with no duplicate elements from `next_childs`, `cur_depth` is the total number of iterations plus 2, `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice, and the function returns `cur_depth + 1` if `res` equals 'found' during any iteration.**
