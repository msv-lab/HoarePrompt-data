The code updates the variable `res` to the value returned by the function `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`. The other variables (`next_childs`, `childs`, `cur_depth`, and `used_coords`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`next_childs` is a list containing the elements of `res`, `childs` must not be empty, `cur_depth` is increased by 1, `used_coords` is the original `used_coords` plus `childs`, `res` is the value returned by `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`**
