Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `coord1` and `coord2`, which represent coordinates in a maze grid. It initializes a depth dictionary from an original one, sets the current coordinate to `coord1`, and marks `coord1` as used. The function then explores neighboring coordinates using a breadth-first search strategy via recursive calls to `func_2`. If a path to `coord2` is found, it returns the depth (number of steps taken) plus one. If no path is found, it returns zero. The function returns different values based on the depth of the search and whether a path was found:**

- Returns `2` if the depth is `1` and a path to `coord2` is found immediately.
- Returns `3` if the depth is `2`.
- Returns `4` if the depth is `3` plus one.
- Returns `cur_depth + 1` where `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 1, covering other depths.
- Returns `0` if no path to `coord2` is found after exploring all possible paths.

This function effectively searches for a shortest path from `coord1` to `coord2` in a grid-based maze, using a breadth-first approach and marking visited coordinates to avoid cycles.
