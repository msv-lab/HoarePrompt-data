Output State: **`jibun` is an integer representing a road square in the maze, `target` is a road square in the maze, `used_coords` is a set of tuples representing the coordinates of squares that have already been visited, and `childs` is a list of all the child nodes that were explored without being in `used_coords`. The loop will continue to execute until either the `target` is found or there are no more unvisited children for the current `jibun`. If the target is found, the function returns 'found'. If the loop finishes without finding the target, `jibun` remains unchanged, `used_coords` includes all previously visited coordinates, and `childs` is a list of all child nodes that were explored without being in `used_coords`.**
