The code snippet adds the contents of `res` to `next_childs`. Let's break down the impact on the program:

- The initial state includes:
  - `next_childs` contains all its original elements plus the elements of `res`.
  - `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 2.
  - `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice.
  - If `res` equals 'found', the function returns `cur_depth + 1`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (the postcondition remains unchanged).

- After executing `next_childs += res`, `next_childs` now contains all its original elements, the elements of `res`, and no other changes are made to `cur_depth` or `used_coords`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`next_childs` contains all its original elements plus the elements of `res`, `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 2, `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice.**
