`next_childs` is assigned the value of `next_childs + res`. This means that the list `next_childs` now contains all the elements from its original contents plus the elements of `res`. The value of `cur_depth` is increased by 1, and `used_coords` remains as the original `used_coords` plus `childs`.

Output State: **`next_childs` is a list containing the elements of `res` added to its original contents, `cur_depth` is increased by 1, `used_coords` is the original `used_coords` plus `childs`.**
