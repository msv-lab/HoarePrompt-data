Postcondition: ***`jibun` is an integer representing a road square in the maze; `target` is a road square in the maze; `used_coords` is a set of tuples representing the coordinates of squares that have already been visited; `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element; `child` is not equal to `target`; if `child` is not in `used_coords`, then `child` is added to `used_coords` and `childs` is a list containing `child`. There is no additional change if the condition is not met.***
