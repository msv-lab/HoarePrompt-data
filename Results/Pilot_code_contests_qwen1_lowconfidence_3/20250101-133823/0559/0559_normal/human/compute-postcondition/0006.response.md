The code appends the value of `child` to the list `childs`. The previous values of the variables are as follows:
- `jibun` is an integer representing a road square in the maze.
- `target` is a road square in the maze.
- `used_coords` is a set of tuples representing the coordinates of squares that have already been visited.
- `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element.
- `child` is not equal to `target`.
- `child` is not in `used_coords`.

After the code runs, the list `childs` will include the value of `child`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`jibun` is an integer representing a road square in the maze; `target` is a road square in the maze; `used_coords` is a set of tuples representing the coordinates of squares that have already been visited; `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element; `child` is not equal to `target`; `child` is not in `used_coords`; `childs` is a list containing `child`.**
