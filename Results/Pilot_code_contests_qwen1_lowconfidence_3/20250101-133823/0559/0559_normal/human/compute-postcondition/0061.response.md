`res` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`. The function `func_2` takes three arguments: `child`, `coord2`, and `used_coords`. The variables `next_childs`, `childs`, `cur_depth`, and `used_coords` remain in their initial states as no changes are made to them in this line of code.

Output State: **`next_childs` contains all its original elements plus the elements of `res`, `childs` must have at least one element, `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 2, `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice, `res` is the value returned by `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`**
