Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `childs` list.
   - For the loop to execute, `childs` must contain at least one element.

2. **Initial States**:
   - `next_childs` is an empty list.
   - `childs` is a list with no duplicate elements from `next_childs`.
   - `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 2.
   - `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice.

3. **Loop Execution Requirements**:
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `childs` must contain at least one element.
   - The initial state specifies that `next_childs` is an empty list, and `childs` is derived from `next_childs`. Therefore, if `next_childs` is empty, `childs` will also be empty unless additional elements are added to `next_childs`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `childs` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - Given that `next_childs` is initially empty, we need to add at least one element to `next_childs` to populate `childs`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- Ensure that `next_childs` has at least one element.
- As a result, `childs` will also have at least one element, allowing the loop to execute.

State: **`next_childs` must have at least one element, `childs` is a list with no duplicate elements from `next_childs`, `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 2, `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice**.
