The code `childs = list(set(next_childs))` removes duplicates from the `next_childs` list and assigns the result back to `childs`. Let's analyze the impact:

- `next_childs` is a list containing all the elements returned by `func_2` for each `child` in the original `childs` list until `func_2` returns 'found'.
- `childs` is initially an empty list.
- `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 1.
- `used_coords` is the original `used_coords` plus all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions.

Since `next_childs` contains all elements from `func_2(child)` calls until 'found' is returned, and these elements are now put into a set before being converted back to a list, duplicates are removed. However, without knowing the exact contents of `next_childs`, we cannot specify the exact elements in `childs`. But we know that `childs` will be a list with no duplicate elements from `next_childs`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`next_childs` is a list containing all the elements returned by `func_2` for each `child` in the original `childs` list until `func_2` returns 'found'; `childs` is a list with no duplicate elements from `next_childs`; `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 1; `used_coords` is the original `used_coords` plus all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions.**
