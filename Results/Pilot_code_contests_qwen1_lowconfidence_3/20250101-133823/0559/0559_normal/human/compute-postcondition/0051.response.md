The value of `cur_depth` is incremented by 1, while the values of `next_childs`, `childs`, and `used_coords` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `next_childs` is a non-empty list, `childs` is a list with no duplicate elements from `next_childs`, `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 2, `used_coords` is the original `used_coords` plus all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions.

Output State: **`next_childs` is a non-empty list, `childs` is a list with no duplicate elements from `next_childs`, `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 2, `used_coords` is the original `used_coords` plus all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions.**
