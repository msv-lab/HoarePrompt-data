The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `jibun`, `target`, and `used_coords`. 

- `jibun` is an integer representing a road square in the maze.
- `target` is a road square in the maze.
- `used_coords` is a set of tuples representing the coordinates of squares that have already been visited.

The function has multiple return points:

- **Case_1:** The program returns 'found'.
- **Case_2:** The program returns 'found'.
- **Case_3:** The program returns 'found'.
- **Case_4:** The program returns a list of all child nodes that were explored without being in `used_coords`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `jibun`, a road square `target`, and a set of tuples `used_coords`. It then checks for specific conditions and returns either 'found' or a list of explored child nodes based on those conditions.
