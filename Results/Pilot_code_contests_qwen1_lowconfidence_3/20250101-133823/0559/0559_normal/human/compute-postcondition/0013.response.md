According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `child` and the state of `used_coords`. The loop iterates over each element in `graph[jibun]`. At the end of the last iteration, `jibun` is an integer representing a road square in the maze, `target` is a road square in the maze, `used_coords` does not include the current `child`, and `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, the next `child` must be an element in `graph[jibun]` and it must not be in `used_coords`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `jibun` remains the same as it is the starting point of the loop and does not change within the loop.
2. `target` remains the same as it is a target square and does not change within the loop.
3. `used_coords` needs to be updated to include the current `child` from the previous iteration if the loop continues.
4. `graph[jibun]` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

Assuming the loop continues, the next `child` will be taken from `graph[jibun]` and added to `used_coords` if it was not already included.

State: **`jibun` is an integer representing a road square in the maze, `target` is a road square in the maze, `used_coords` includes the current `child`, and `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element.**
