The code `next_childs += res` appends the elements of the `res` list to the `next_childs` list. However, the initial value of `res` is not specified in the initial state, and since it's not mentioned that `res` is empty, we cannot assume that. Therefore, `next_childs` will be updated by adding the elements of `res` to it.

Given that `next_childs` must have at least one element, and `res` is not the result of 'found', it implies that `res` could contain any elements that are not explicitly defined.

Output State: **`next_childs` contains all its original elements plus the elements of `res`, `childs` is a list with no duplicate elements from `next_childs`, `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 2, `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice, `res` is not the result of 'found'**
