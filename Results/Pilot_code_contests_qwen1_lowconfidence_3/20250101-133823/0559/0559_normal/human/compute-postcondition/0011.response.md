The code appends the value of `child` to the list `childs`. This means that `child` is added to the existing list of `childs`.

The initial state includes:
- `jibun` is an integer representing a road square in the maze.
- `target` is a road square in the maze.
- `used_coords` does not include the current `child`.
- `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element.
- If `child` equals `target`, the function returns 'found'.

After executing the code `childs.append(child)`, the following changes occur:
- The value of `child` is added to the list `childs`.

Since the code does not modify the values of `jibun`, `target`, `used_coords`, or `graph`, these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`jibun` is an integer representing a road square in the maze, `target` is a road square in the maze, `used_coords` does not include the current `child`, and `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element. The list `childs` now includes the value of `child`.**
