The code assigns the result of the function call `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` to the variable `res`. The values of `next_childs`, `childs`, `cur_depth`, and `used_coords` remain unchanged, but `res` is now assigned the result of the function call.

Output State: **`next_childs` must have at least one element, `childs` is a list with no duplicate elements from `next_childs`, `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 2, `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice, `res` is the result of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`**
