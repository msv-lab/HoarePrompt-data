To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states step by step.

### Analysis of the Loop Code

The loop iterates over each `child` in the `childs` list and performs the following operations:
1. Calls the function `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` and stores the result in `res`.
2. If `res` is 'found', the function returns `cur_depth + 1`.
3. Otherwise, appends `res` to `next_childs`.

### Understanding the Variables

- **`cur_coord`**: Initially set to `coord1`. This variable will store the current coordinate being explored.
- **`cur_depth`**: Initially set to 1. This variable keeps track of the depth or level of exploration.
- **`used_coords`**: Initially contains `[coord1] + childs`. This list keeps track of all coordinates that have been visited.
- **`next_childs`**: An initially empty list. This list accumulates new coordinates to explore in subsequent iterations.

### Iteration Analysis

#### First Iteration
- `child` is taken from `childs`.
- `res` is computed by calling `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`.
- If `res` is 'found', the function returns `cur_depth + 1`.
- Otherwise, `res` is added to `next_childs`.
- `used_coords` becomes `[coord1] + [child]`.

#### Second Iteration
- `child` is taken from `next_childs` (first element).
- `res` is computed by calling `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`.
- If `res` is 'found', the function returns `cur_depth + 1`.
- Otherwise, `res` is added to `next_childs`.
- `used_coords` becomes `[coord1] + [first_child] + [second_child]`.

#### Third Iteration
- `child` is taken from `next_childs` (second element).
- `res` is computed by calling `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`.
- If `res` is 'found', the function returns `cur_depth + 1`.
- Otherwise, `res` is added to `next_childs`.
- `used_coords` becomes `[coord1] + [first_child] + [second_child] + [third_child]`.

### Final State After All Iterations

Let's consider the final state after the loop has completed all its iterations.

1. **If the loop does not find the target (`end_coord`)**:
   - `cur_coord` will be the last coordinate explored.
   - `cur_depth` will be the maximum depth reached during exploration.
   - `used_coords` will include all coordinates explored up to the last iteration.
   - `next_childs` will be an empty list because no more children were found.

2. **If the loop finds the target (`end_coord`)**:
   - The function will return `cur_depth + 1` immediately, so the loop will terminate without further iterations.
   - `cur_coord` will be `end_coord`.
   - `cur_depth` will be the depth at which the target was found.
   - `used_coords` will include all coordinates explored up to the point of finding the target.
   - `next_childs` will be an empty list.

### Output State

Given the analysis above, we can conclude:

**Output State:**
- `cur_coord` is either `end_coord` if the target is found or the last coordinate explored if the target is not found.
- `cur_depth` is the minimum depth to reach `cur_coord` if the target is found or the maximum depth reached if the target is not found.
- `used_coords` includes all coordinates explored during the search.
- `next_childs` is an empty list.
- `res` is 'found' if the target is found, otherwise, it is not 'found'.

**Final Output State:**
```plaintext
Output State: **`cur_coord` is either `end_coord` if found or the last coordinate explored if not found, `cur_depth` is the minimum depth to reach `cur_coord` if found or the maximum depth reached if not found, `used_coords` includes all coordinates explored, `next_childs` is an empty list, `res` is 'found' if the target is found, otherwise, it is not 'found'.**
