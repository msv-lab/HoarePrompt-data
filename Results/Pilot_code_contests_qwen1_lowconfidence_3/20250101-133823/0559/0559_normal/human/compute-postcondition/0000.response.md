The code initializes an empty list named `childs`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`jibun`, `target`, and `used_coords`). 

Output State: **`jibun` is an integer representing a road square in the maze, `target` is a road square in the maze, `used_coords` is a set of tuples representing the coordinates of squares that have already been visited, and `childs` is an empty list.**
