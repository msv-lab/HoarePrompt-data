Postcondition: ***`next_childs` contains all its original elements plus the elements of `res`, `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 2, `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice. If `res` equals 'found', the function returns `cur_depth + 1`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (the postcondition remains unchanged).***
