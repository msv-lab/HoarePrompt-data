The code assigns the result of the function call `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` to the variable `res`. However, the function `func_2` itself is not defined, so we cannot determine the exact value of `res`. We know that the `next_childs` list remains unchanged, `childs` must not be empty, `cur_depth` is increased by 1, and `used_coords` is updated to include the original `used_coords` plus `childs`.

Output State: **`next_childs` is an empty list, `childs` must not be empty, `cur_depth` is increased by 1, `used_coords` is the original `used_coords` plus `childs`, `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`**
