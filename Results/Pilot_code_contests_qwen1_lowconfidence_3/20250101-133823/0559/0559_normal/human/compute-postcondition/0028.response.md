According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `childs` list. If the length of `childs` is not zero (`len(childs) != 0`), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `childs` is a list with no duplicates from `next_childs` and has a non-zero length. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the length of `childs` must still be non-zero.

Since `next_childs` contains potential duplicates and `childs` is derived from `next_childs` without duplicates, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `childs` is not empty after the loop body executes.

State: **`next_childs` is a list with potential duplicates, `childs` is a list with no duplicates from `next_childs` and must not be empty**
