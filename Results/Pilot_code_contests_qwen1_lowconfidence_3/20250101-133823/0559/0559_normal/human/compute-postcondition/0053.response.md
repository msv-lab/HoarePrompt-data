`used_coords` is updated by adding the contents of `childs` to it. Since `used_coords` originally included all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions and now it is being added to itself, the new value of `used_coords` will include all the `childs` twice. However, since `childs` is a list with no duplicate elements, the operation does not introduce duplicates.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `next_childs` remains an empty list.
- `childs` remains a list with no duplicate elements from `next_childs`.
- `cur_depth` remains the number of times the loop executed plus 2.
- `used_coords` now includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice.

Output State: **`next_childs` is an empty list, `childs` is a list with no duplicate elements from `next_childs`, `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 2, `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice.**
