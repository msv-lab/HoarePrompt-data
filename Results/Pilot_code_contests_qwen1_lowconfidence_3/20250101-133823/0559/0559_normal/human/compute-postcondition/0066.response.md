The code assigns the result of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` to the variable `res`. The function call affects `res`, but the values of `next_childs`, `cur_depth`, and `used_coords` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`next_childs` contains all its original elements plus the elements of `res`, `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 3, `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice, `res` is the result of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`**
