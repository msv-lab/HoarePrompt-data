According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `child`. The loop iterates over each element in the `childs` list. At the end of the previous iteration, `next_childs` is updated to include the elements of `res` added to its original contents, `cur_depth` is increased by 1, and `used_coords` is the original `used_coords` plus `childs`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what changes occur within the loop body and how they affect the variables. However, since the loop body is omitted, we need to infer based on the given information.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **`next_childs`**: This list is updated by adding the elements of `res` to its original contents. The value of `next_childs` remains unchanged for the next iteration because it is not modified within the loop.
2. **`cur_depth`**: This variable is increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration. For the loop to continue, `cur_depth` must be incremented again, meaning it will be increased by another 1 for the next iteration.
3. **`used_coords`**: This set is updated by adding the elements of `childs` to the original `used_coords`. Since the loop continues, `used_coords` must be updated to include the elements of `childs` from the current iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
- `next_childs` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `cur_depth` is increased by 1 (it will be `cur_depth + 2` at the start of the next iteration).
- `used_coords` is updated to include the elements of `childs` from the current iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

State: **`next_childs` is a list containing the elements of `res` added to its original contents, `cur_depth` is increased by 2, `used_coords` is the original `used_coords` plus `childs`**.
