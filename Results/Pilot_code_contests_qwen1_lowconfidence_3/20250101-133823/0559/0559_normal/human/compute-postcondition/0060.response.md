According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `childs` list. The state at the end of the previous iteration provides us with several pieces of information:

- `next_childs` contains all its original elements plus the elements of `res`.
- `childs` is a list with no duplicate elements from `next_childs`.
- `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 2.
- `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice.
- `res` is not the result of 'found'.

To determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `childs`.
2. **Variables Update**: After processing an element in `childs`, it should be removed or otherwise marked as processed.

Since the loop is iterating over `childs`, the variable `child` will be assigned the value of each element in `childs` one by one. For the loop to execute again, `childs` must contain at least one element.

Given the information, at the end of the previous iteration:
- `next_childs` contains all its original elements plus the elements of `res`.
- `childs` is a list with no duplicate elements from `next_childs`.
- `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 2.
- `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice.
- `res` is not the result of 'found'.

For the loop to execute again, `childs` must still contain at least one element. Therefore, we assume that the loop will continue if `childs` is non-empty.

State: **`next_childs` contains all its original elements plus the elements of `res`, `childs` is a list with no duplicate elements from `next_childs`, `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 2, `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice, `res` is not the result of 'found', and `childs` must have at least one element.**

However, since we are focusing on the essential states to be adjusted for the next iteration, we can summarize the key states:

State: **`next_childs` contains all its original elements plus the elements of `res`, `childs` must have at least one element, `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 2, `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice, `res` is not the result of 'found'.**
