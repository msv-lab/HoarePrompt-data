The code `childs = list(set(next_childs))` removes duplicates from `next_childs` and assigns the result to `childs`. The initial state is that `next_childs` contains all its original elements plus the elements of `res` for each iteration, `childs` is a list with no duplicate elements from `next_childs`, `cur_depth` is the total number of iterations plus 2, `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice, and the function returns `cur_depth + 1` if `res` equals 'found' during any iteration.

After executing the code, `next_childs` remains unchanged because the assignment does not modify it, but `childs` is updated to contain only unique elements from `next_childs`.

Output State: **`next_childs` contains all its original elements plus the elements of `res` for each iteration, `childs` contains unique elements from `next_childs`, `cur_depth` is the total number of iterations plus 2, `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice, and the function returns `cur_depth + 1` if `res` equals 'found' during any iteration.**
