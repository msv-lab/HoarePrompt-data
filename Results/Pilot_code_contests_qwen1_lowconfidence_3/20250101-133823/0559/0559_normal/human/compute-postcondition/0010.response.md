Postcondition: ***`jibun` is an integer representing a road square in the maze, `target` is a road square in the maze, `used_coords` does not include the current `child`, and `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element. If `child` equals `target`, the function returns 'found'. Otherwise, no change in the return value.***
