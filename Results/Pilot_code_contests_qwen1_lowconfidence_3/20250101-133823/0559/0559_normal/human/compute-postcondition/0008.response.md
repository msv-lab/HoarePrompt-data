According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `child`. The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `graph[jibun]` and `child` is not equal to `target`. Additionally, if `child` is not in `used_coords`, it gets added to `used_coords`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `jibun` is an integer representing a road square in the maze.
- `target` is a road square in the maze.
- `used_coords` is a set of tuples representing the coordinates of squares that have already been visited.
- `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element.
- `child` is not equal to `target`.
- If `child` is not in `used_coords`, it was added to `used_coords` and `child` is appended to `childs`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. `graph[jibun]` must still contain at least one element (since we just removed one `child`).
2. `child` must not be equal to `target`.
3. `child` must not be in `used_coords` for it to be added again.

Since `child` is not equal to `target` and is already considered for addition to `used_coords` (if it wasn't already there), the primary condition to check is that `graph[jibun]` should still have at least one element, and `child` must not be in `used_coords` for it to be added again.

However, since the problem statement mentions no additional changes if the condition is not met, we assume the loop will continue only if the above conditions are satisfied.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `graph[jibun]` must still contain at least one element.
- `child` must not be in `used_coords`.

So, the state adjustments would be:
- `jibun` remains unchanged.
- `target` remains unchanged.
- `used_coords` must not include the current `child`.
- `graph[jibun]` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`jibun` is an integer representing a road square in the maze; `target` is a road square in the maze; `used_coords` does not include the current `child`; `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element**
