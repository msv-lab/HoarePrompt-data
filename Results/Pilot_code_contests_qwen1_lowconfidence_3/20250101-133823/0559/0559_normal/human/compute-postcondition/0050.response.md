To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the condition under which the `while` loop continues to run: `len(childs) != 0`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `next_childs` is a list containing all the elements returned by `func_2` for each `child` in the original `childs` list until `func_2` returns 'found'.
- `childs` is a list with no duplicate elements from `next_childs`.
- `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 1.
- `used_coords` is the original `used_coords` plus all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions.

For the loop to execute one more time, `len(childs)` must be non-zero. This means that there must still be at least one element in the `childs` list.

Let's break down the requirements:
1. The `next_childs` list contains elements from `func_2` calls, but these elements are then filtered into the `childs` list without duplicates.
2. Since `childs` is used directly in the loop condition, the only thing we need to ensure is that `len(childs)` is non-zero.

The current state does not provide information about the contents of `next_childs`, so we cannot make assumptions about the contents of `childs`. However, since `childs` must be non-empty for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `next_childs` has at least one element that is not a duplicate of any existing elements in `childs`.

Thus, we need to adjust the state such that `next_childs` is non-empty, ensuring that `childs` remains non-empty after filtering out duplicates.

State: **`next_childs` is a non-empty list, `childs` is a list with no duplicate elements from `next_childs`, `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 1, `used_coords` is the original `used_coords` plus all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions**
