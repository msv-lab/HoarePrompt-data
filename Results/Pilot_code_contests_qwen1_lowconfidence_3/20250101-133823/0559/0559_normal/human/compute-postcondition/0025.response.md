`next_childs` is appended with the value of `res`. The value of `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`, which could be any value. The states of the other variables (`cur_coord`, `cur_depth`, `used_coords`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur_coord` is the second element of `next_childs`, `cur_depth` is updated to 4 if `res` equals 'found', otherwise, `cur_depth` remains 3, `used_coords` includes `coord1` and the second element of `next_childs`, and `next_childs` is updated by appending `res`.

Output State: **`cur_coord` is the second element of `next_childs`, `cur_depth` is updated to 4 if `res` equals 'found', otherwise, `cur_depth` remains 3, `used_coords` includes `coord1` and the second element of `next_childs`, and `next_childs` is updated by appending `res`**
