`next_childs` is assigned the value of `res` using the `+=` operator, which means `next_childs` will now contain whatever `res` currently holds. The initial state of `next_childs` is an empty list, so if `res` is not a list, it will be converted into a list containing the elements of `res`. The states of the other variables (`childs`, `cur_depth`, `used_coords`, and `res`) are not affected.

Output State: **`next_childs` is now a list containing the elements of `res`, `childs` must not be empty, `cur_depth` is increased by 1, `used_coords` is the original `used_coords` plus `childs`, `res` is not 'found'**
