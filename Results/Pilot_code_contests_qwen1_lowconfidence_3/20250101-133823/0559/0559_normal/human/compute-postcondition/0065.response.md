According to the code, the loop iterates over each `child` in the `childs` list. For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:

1. The `cur_depth` variable should be incremented by 1 because it represents the number of times the loop has executed plus 2. Therefore, if the loop executes one more time, `cur_depth` should be incremented by 1.
2. The `next_childs` list must include all its original elements plus the elements of `res` from the previous iteration.
3. The `used_coords` set must include all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions, but since the loop hasn't run yet in this new iteration, we assume that `used_coords` will still contain the same elements as before.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `next_childs` will contain all its original elements plus the elements of `res`.
- `cur_depth` will be the current value plus 1.
- `used_coords` will remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`next_childs` contains all its original elements plus the elements of `res`, `cur_depth` is the number of times the loop executed plus 3, `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions twice**
