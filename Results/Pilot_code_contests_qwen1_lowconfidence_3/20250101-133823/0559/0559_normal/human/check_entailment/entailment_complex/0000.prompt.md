You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi has a maze, which is a grid of H \times W squares with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns.

The square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column is a "wall" square if S_{ij} is `#`, and a "road" square if S_{ij} is `.`.

From a road square, you can move to a horizontally or vertically adjacent road square.

You cannot move out of the maze, move to a wall square, or move diagonally.

Takahashi will choose a starting square and a goal square, which can be any road squares, and give the maze to Aoki.

Aoki will then travel from the starting square to the goal square, in the minimum number of moves required.

In this situation, find the maximum possible number of moves Aoki has to make.

Constraints

* 1 \leq H,W \leq 20
* S_{ij} is `.` or `#`.
* S contains at least two occurrences of `.`.
* Any road square can be reached from any road square in zero or more moves.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: coord1 and coord2 are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) of road squares in the maze, where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W. depth_dict_org is a dictionary mapping each coordinate to its initial depth (distance from the start), graph is a dictionary where keys are coordinates and values are lists of adjacent road square coordinates, and end_coord is the coordinate of the goal square.

    depth_dict = depth_dict_org.copy()

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `next_childs` is an empty list, `childs` is a list with no duplicate elements, `cur_depth` is the total number of iterations plus 1, `used_coords` includes all the `childs` encountered during the loop executions, the function returns `cur_depth + 1` if `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` returns 'found' for any `child` in the final iteration.
    return 0
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `coord1` and `coord2`, which represent coordinates in a maze grid. It initializes a depth dictionary from an original one, sets the current coordinate to `coord1`, and marks `coord1` as used. The function then explores neighboring coordinates using a breadth-first search strategy via recursive calls to `func_2`. If a path to `coord2` is found, it returns the depth (number of steps taken) plus one. If no path is found, it returns zero. The function returns different values based on the depth of the search and whether a path was found:

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: jibun is an integer representing a road square in the maze, target is a road square in the maze, and used_coords is a set of tuples representing the coordinates of squares that have already been visited. The function assumes the existence of a graph where each key is a road square and the value is a list of its adjacent road squares.
def func_2(jibun, target, used_coords):
    childs = []
    for child in graph[jibun]:
        if child == target:
            return 'found'
        
        if child not in used_coords:
            childs.append(child)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `jibun` is an integer representing a road square in the maze, `target` is a road square in the maze, `used_coords` is a set of tuples representing the coordinates of squares that have already been visited, and `childs` is a list of all the child nodes that were explored without being in `used_coords`. The loop will continue to execute until either the `target` is found or there are no more unvisited children for the current `jibun`. If the target is found, the function returns 'found'. If the loop finishes without finding the target, `jibun` remains unchanged, `used_coords` includes all previously visited coordinates, and `childs` is a list of all child nodes that were explored without being in `used_coords`.
    return childs
    #`The program returns a list of all child nodes that were explored without being in used_coords`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `jibun`, `target`, and `used_coords`. `jibun` represents a road square in the maze, `target` is another road square in the maze, and `used_coords` is a set of tuples representing the coordinates of squares that have already been visited. The function explores the children (adjacent squares) of the given `jibun` to check if any of them match the `target`. If the `target` is found, the function returns `'found'`. If the `target` is not found among the children, the function returns a list of all child nodes that were explored and confirmed not to be in `used_coords`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
