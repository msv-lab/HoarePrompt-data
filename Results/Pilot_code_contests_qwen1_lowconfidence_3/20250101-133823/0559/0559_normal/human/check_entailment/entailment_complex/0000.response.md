Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle the case where the starting square and the goal square are the same. According to the problem description, the maximum possible number of moves Aoki has to make should be calculated, and if the starting square and the goal square are the same, the maximum number of moves should be the total number of road squares minus one (since moving from the starting square to itself requires the maximum number of intermediate moves).

However, the provided code does not account for this scenario. In `func_1`, the function returns `0` if no path is found between `coord1` and `coord2`, even if `coord1` and `coord2` are the same. This results in an incorrect output for the case where the starting and goal squares are the same.

To fix this, the code should check if `coord1` and `coord2` are the same before starting the BFS and return the total number of road squares minus one if they are the same.
