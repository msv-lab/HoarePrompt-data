Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible number of moves Aoki has to make. The primary issue lies in the function `func_1`. The function attempts to find the shortest path between two points using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, but it does not consider the possibility of finding the longest path. BFS is designed to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph, not the longest path. To find the maximum possible number of moves, we need to explore all possible paths between pairs of road squares, which requires a different approach, such as depth-first search (DFS) combined with memoization or a more sophisticated algorithm like Floyd-Warshall for all-pairs shortest paths.

Here is a brief outline of the issues:
1. The function `func_1` uses BFS to find the shortest path between two points, which is not suitable for finding the longest path.
2. The function `func_2` is designed to find a single path and does not support exploring multiple paths efficiently.
3. The logic for finding the maximum depth is flawed and does not account for all possible paths between pairs of road squares.

To correctly solve the problem, we would need to implement an algorithm that considers all possible paths and finds the one with the maximum number of moves. This typically involves using a more advanced graph traversal technique or dynamic programming to explore all possible paths and keep track of the longest one.
