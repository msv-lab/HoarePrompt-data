Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not seem to be solving the given problem. The problem requires finding the maximum possible number of moves Aoki has to make to travel from a starting square to a goal square in the maze. However, the given functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not appear to be related to the maze problem at all. Instead, they seem to be part of a depth-first search or graph traversal algorithm, which is not aligned with the requirements of the problem.

To solve the problem, you would need to implement a breadth-first search (BFS) or Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between any two road squares and then determine the maximum distance among all pairs of road squares. The current implementation does not achieve this and hence is incorrect.
