Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` and `func_2` seem to attempt to find the shortest path between two coordinates using a depth-first search approach. However, the problem requires finding the maximum possible number of moves Aoki has to make, which is essentially the diameter of the maze (the longest shortest path between any two road squares).

Here are the issues with the provided code:

1. **Incorrect Objective**: The code aims to find the shortest path between two points rather than the longest shortest path (diameter).
2. **Depth-first Search (DFS) Approach**: DFS is not suitable for finding the diameter of a graph. Instead, we need to find the longest path between any two nodes, which typically involves a BFS-based approach to find the longest path or a two-BFS approach to confirm the diameter.
3. **Graph Representation**: The graph representation (`graph`) is not defined in the provided code, making it impossible to run the functions as they stand.

To correctly solve the problem, we would need to implement a BFS or a two-BFS approach to find the diameter of the maze. Here is a conceptual outline of how such a solution might look:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(start, graph, visited):
    queue = deque([start])
    distance = {start: 0}
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                distance[neighbor] = distance[current] + 1
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return distance

def find_diameter(graph):
    # Find the node with the farthest distance
    start_node = max(graph.keys(), key=lambda x: len(bfs(x, graph, set())))
    # Perform BFS again from the farthest node to find the diameter
    farthest_node = max(bfs(start_node, graph, set()), key=distance.get)
    return distance[farthest_node]

# Example usage
H, W = map(int, input().split())
maze = [input() for _ in range(H)]
graph = {}
for i in range(H):
    for j in range(W):
        if maze[i][j] == '.':
            for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]:
                nx, ny = i + dx, j + dy
                if 0 <= nx < H and 0 <= ny < W and maze[nx][ny] == '.':
                    if (i, j) not in graph:
                        graph[(i, j)] = set()
                    graph[(i, j)].add((nx, ny))

print(find_diameter(graph))
```

This solution correctly finds the diameter of the maze, which is the maximum possible number of moves Aoki has to make.
