The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `coord1` and `coord2`, which represent coordinates in a maze grid. It initializes a depth dictionary from an original one, sets the current coordinate to `coord1`, and marks `coord1` as used. The function then explores neighboring coordinates using a breadth-first search strategy via recursive calls to `func_2`. If a path to `coord2` is found, it returns the depth (number of steps taken) plus one. If no path is found, it returns zero. The function returns different values based on the depth of the search and whether a path was found:
