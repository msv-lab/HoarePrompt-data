The function `func_3` accepts no parameters directly. It reads a single string input from the standard input, which should consist of four non-negative integers separated by spaces. It then processes this input to split it into individual integers and convert them into a list. The function returns this list `[a, b, c, d]`. The function enforces the constraint that the sum of these integers should be less than or equal to \(10^5\), though this constraint is not checked within the function itself. Therefore, the final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns a list of four non-negative integers provided as input.
