The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are non-negative integers. If `y` is 0, the function returns `x`, which is equal to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, and if `y` is 0, it returns `x`, which is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`.
