The code `print(*out)` simply prints the list `out`. The list `out` is defined as `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d`. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `s1`, and `s2` are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the only change is in the way `out` is printed.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a non-negative integer
- `b` is a non-negative integer such that `b - a` is non-negative
- `c` is a non-negative integer
- `d` is a non-negative integer
- `s1` is `b - a`
- `s2` is `c - d`

After executing the code, the list `out` will be printed as specified. No other changes occur to the variables.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer such that `b - a` is non-negative, `c` is a non-negative integer, `d` is a non-negative integer, `s1` is `b - a`, `s2` is `c - d`, and the list `out` is printed as `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d`.
