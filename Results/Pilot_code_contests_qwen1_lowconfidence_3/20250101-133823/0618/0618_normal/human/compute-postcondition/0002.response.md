Functionality: **The function `func_8` accepts two parameters: `x` and `r`. `x` represents the count of a specific number in the sequence, and `r` is the target number value, which can be 1, 2, or 3. The function calculates and returns the integer division of `(x + r - 1)` by `r`. This means it computes the ceiling of the division of `x` by `r`. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function handles the case where `r` is 1 correctly, as `(x + 1 - 1) // 1` simplifies to `x`. However, it is worth noting that for `r = 1`, the result is simply `x`, which is already handled by the given formula. The function also implicitly handles the case where `x` is 0, as `(0 + r - 1) // r` would be `0` for any valid `r`. Therefore, the function correctly computes the desired value without any missing logic.**
