The code `c -= 1` decreases the value of `c` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `a` is 0, and `s1` is `b - a`, which simplifies to `b`, while `s2` is `c - d`. The condition `s1 != s2` holds, and `s1 + 1` does not equal `s2`.

Since `c` is decremented by 1, the new value of `c` will be `c - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The updated state is:

Output State: **`a` is 0, `b` is `b`, `c` is `c - 1`, `d` is `d`, and `s1` is `b`, `s2` is `c - 1 - d`.**
