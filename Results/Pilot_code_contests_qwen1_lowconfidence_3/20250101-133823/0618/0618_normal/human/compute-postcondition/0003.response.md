The code snippet updates the values of `x` and `y` using tuple unpacking. Given the initial state where `x` is a non-negative integer and equals the original value of `y`, and `y` must be non-zero, let's analyze the impact:

1. Initially, `x` and `y` have the same value, and both are non-negative integers with `y` being non-zero.
2. The line `x, y = y, x % y` means that `x` will take the value of `y`, and `y` will take the value of `x % y`.
3. Since `x` initially equals `y`, `x % y` is `0` because the remainder of dividing any number by itself is `0`.

Therefore, after executing the code:
- `x` will be updated to the value of `y`.
- `y` will be updated to `0`.

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer (initial value of `y`), `y` is 0**
