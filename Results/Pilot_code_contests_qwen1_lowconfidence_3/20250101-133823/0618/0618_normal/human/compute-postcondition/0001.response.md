The function `func_8` accepts two parameters: `x` and `r`. `x` is an integer representing the count of a specific number in the sequence, and `r` is an integer representing the target number value (1, 2, or 3) such that \(0 \leq x \leq 10^5\) and \(1 \leq r \leq 3\). After executing the function body, the function returns the value of \(((x + r - 1) // r)\).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_8` is to accept two integers `x` and `r`, and return the value of \(((x + r - 1) // r)\).
