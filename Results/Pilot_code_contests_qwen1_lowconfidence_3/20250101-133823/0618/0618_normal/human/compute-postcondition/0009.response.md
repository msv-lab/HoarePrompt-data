Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function enters a loop where it repeatedly updates `x` and `y` such that `x` becomes `y` and `y` becomes `x % y` until `y` becomes 0. At this point, `x` contains the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function then returns `x`. Potential edge cases include when either `x` or `y` is 0; in such cases, the function correctly returns the non-zero value as the GCD. If both `x` and `y` are 0, the function will enter an infinite loop because the condition `while y:` will always be true, and `x % y` will not be defined. Therefore, the function should handle the case where both `x` and `y` are 0 by raising an exception or returning a specific value to indicate an error.**
