Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `x` is a non-negative integer (its initial value).
   - `y` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `while y:`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as `y` is non-zero.

3. **State After Previous Iteration:**
   - `y` is currently 0.

4. **Condition Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must become non-zero.
   - Since `y` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it needs to change to a non-zero value for the loop to continue.

5. **Required Adjustment:**
   - We need to adjust the state such that `y` is non-zero at the start of the next iteration.
   - The only state we need to modify is `y`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `y` must be non-zero for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the modified state for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`x` is a non-negative integer (initial value of `y`), `y` is non-zero**
