Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that 0 < `a` + `b` + `c` + `d` â‰¤ 10^5. `s1` is `b - a`, `s2` is `c - d`. After executing the if-else block:
- If `a > 0`, then `a` is reduced by 1, `b` remains unchanged, `c` is set to `d + 1`, `d` remains unchanged, `s1` becomes 0, `s2` becomes 1, and `out` is `[0] + [1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d`.
- If `a` is 0, then `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `c` is reduced by 1, `d` remains unchanged, `s1` becomes `b`, `s2` becomes `c - 1 - d`, and `out` is `[2] + [1, 2] * b + [3, 2] * d`.***
