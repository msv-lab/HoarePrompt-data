The given code updates the variables `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. Specifically, `x` is assigned the value of `y`, and `y` is assigned the value of `x % y`. This process is typically part of the algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. Since the initial state only mentions that `y` must be non-zero for the loop to execute one more time, we will focus on updating the values of `x` and `y` according to the given code.

Output State: **`x` is equal to the previous value of `y`, `y` is equal to `x % y`**
