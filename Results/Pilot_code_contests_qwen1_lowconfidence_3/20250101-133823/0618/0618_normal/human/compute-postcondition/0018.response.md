Let's go through the process step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is a non-negative integer.
   - `b` is a non-negative integer.
   - `c` is a non-negative integer.
   - `d` is a non-negative integer such that `d` is greater than 0 and equal to the original value of `d` minus 1.
   - `s1` is `b - a`.
   - `s2` is `c - (d - 1)`.
   - `s1 != s2`.
   - `s1 + 1 != s2`.
   - `s1 == s2 + 1`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - `out = [1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d + [3]`

   - Let's break down what this line does:
     - `[1, 0] * a` creates a list consisting of `[1, 0]` repeated `a` times.
     - `[1, 2] * (b - a)` creates a list consisting of `[1, 2]` repeated `(b - a)` times.
     - `[3, 2] * d` creates a list consisting of `[3, 2]` repeated `d` times.
     - `[3]` adds a single element `3` to the list.

   - Combining these, `out` is constructed by concatenating these lists together.

3. **Resulting `out` List**:
   - Since `a`, `b`, and `d` are known to be non-negative integers with specific conditions:
     - `a` contributes `[1, 0]` `a` times.
     - `b - a` contributes `[1, 2]` `b - a` times.
     - `d` contributes `[3, 2]` `d` times.
     - A single `3` is added at the end.

4. **Output State**:
   - The resulting list `out` is `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d + [3]`.
   - The preconditions that remain unchanged are:
     - `a` is a non-negative integer.
     - `b` is a non-negative integer.
     - `c` is a non-negative integer.
     - `d` is a non-negative integer such that `d` is greater than 0 and equal to the original value of `d` minus 1.
     - `s1` is `b - a`.
     - `s2` is `c - (d - 1)`.
     - `s1 != s2`.
     - `s1 + 1 != s2`.
     - `s1 == s2 + 1`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer; `b` is a non-negative integer; `c` is a non-negative integer; `d` is a non-negative integer such that `d` is greater than 0 and equal to the original value of `d` minus 1; `s1` is `b - a`; `s2` is `c - (d - 1)`; `s1 != s2`; `s1 + 1 != s2`; `s1 == s2 + 1`; `out` is `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d + [3]`.**
