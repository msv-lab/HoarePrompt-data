Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that 0 < `a` + `b` + `c` + `d` â‰¤ 10^5, `s1` is `b - a`, `s2` is `c - d`, and `out` is a list. If `s1 == s2`, then `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer such that `b - a` is non-negative, `c` is a non-negative integer, `d` is a non-negative integer, `out` is `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d`. Otherwise, if `a > 0` and `s1 + 1 == s2`, `a` is reduced by 1, `b` remains unchanged, `c` is set to `d + 1`, `d` remains unchanged, `s1` becomes 0, `s2` becomes 1, and `out` is `[0] + [1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d`. If `a > 0` and `s1 + 1 != s2`, or `a == 0`, `a` is either 0 or remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `c` is either reduced by 1 or remains unchanged, `d` remains unchanged, `s1` becomes `b` or 0, `s2` becomes `c - 1 - d` or `a - 2`, and `out` is either `[2] + [1, 2] * b + [3, 2] * d` or `[1, 0] * a + [1]`. If `a == 0` and `s1 + 1 == s2`, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `c` is reduced by 1, `d` remains unchanged, `s1` becomes `b`, `s2` becomes `c - 1 - d`, and `out` is `[2] + [1, 2] * b + [3, 2] * d`. If `a == 0` and `s1 + 1 != s2`, `a` is 0, `b` is `a - 1`, `c` is `a - 2`, `d` is 0, `s1` is `-1`, `s2` is `a - 2`, and `out` is a list consisting of `[1, 0]` repeated `a` times followed by `[1]`.***
