The function `func_4` accepts a callable function `f` and a variable-length tuple `dim` of positive integers. If `dim` is empty, it returns the result of calling `f()`. Otherwise, it returns a list of `dim[0]` elements, where each element is the result of recursively calling `func_4(f, *dim[1:])`. This process continues until `dim` becomes empty, at which point `f()` is called. The function effectively generates a nested list structure based on the dimensions specified in `dim`, with each leaf node being the result of calling `f()`.
