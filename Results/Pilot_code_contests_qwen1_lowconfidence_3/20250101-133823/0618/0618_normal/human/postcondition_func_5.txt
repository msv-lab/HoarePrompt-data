The function `func_6` accepts a list `l` containing four non-negative integers representing the counts of numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively, where the sum of the elements in `l` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^5\). It also accepts two optional parameters `start` and `end`, both defaulting to 0. After executing the function, it returns a range object starting from `start` (default is 0) and ending at `len(l) + end` (default is `len(l)`).

The function does not modify the input list `l` in any way. If `end` is specified and is greater than `len(l)`, the function still returns a range object up to `len(l)`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations that need special handling within the code itself, as the code directly constructs the range object based on the provided parameters without additional checks.
