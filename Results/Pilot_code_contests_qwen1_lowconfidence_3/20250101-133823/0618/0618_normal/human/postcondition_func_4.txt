The function `func_5` accepts three parameters: `start`, `step`, and `count`. It returns a range object starting from `start`, ending at `start + step * count`, with a step of `step`. If `step` is 1, the range will have `count` elements, otherwise, it will have `(start + step * count - start) // step` elements. Potential edge cases include when `step` is 0 or negative, which would result in an invalid range object or an empty range. The function does not handle these edge cases, so it is important to ensure that `step` is a positive integer.
