Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly when it comes to determining whether a beautiful sequence can be constructed. As illustrated in the input `2 2 2 3`, the program incorrectly attempts to generate a sequence rather than recognizing that no valid sequence can be constructed under these constraints. The function `func_8` and other utility functions are correctly implemented based on their descriptions, but they do not influence the main logic of constructing a sequence or identifying impossible cases. The core issue lies in the main function `func_1`, which fails to properly validate the feasibility of constructing a beautiful sequence before attempting to generate one. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program needs to be revised to correctly identify impossible cases and output "NO" accordingly.
