Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The program does not handle all possible cases correctly, particularly when it comes to determining whether a valid beautiful sequence can be constructed. 

Specifically, the function `func_1()` attempts to construct a sequence based on certain conditions but does not thoroughly check if the given counts (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) can actually form a valid beautiful sequence. For example, consider the input `1 2 3 4`. According to the problem description, it should output "NO" because it is impossible to form a beautiful sequence with these counts. However, the current implementation tries to construct a sequence without checking the feasibility, leading to incorrect outputs for invalid inputs.

The output hints for `func_8()` are provided and show that the function correctly handles the ceiling division for given inputs, but this does not affect the overall correctness of constructing the sequence. The issue lies in the main logic of `func_1()`, which fails to properly validate the input before attempting to construct the sequence.

Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate since the program still fails to handle certain edge cases and does not correctly determine the impossibility of constructing a valid beautiful sequence in all scenarios.
