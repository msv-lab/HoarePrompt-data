Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, consider the input `2 2 2 3`. According to the problem description, it should output "NO" because it's impossible to construct a beautiful sequence with the given counts of numbers. However, the current implementation might produce a valid sequence, which would be incorrect. 

To illustrate, let's manually check this case:

- We have 2 zeros, 2 ones, 2 twos, and 3 threes.
- The required differences between consecutive numbers are always 1.

One possible valid sequence could be: `0 1 0 1 2 3 2 3 3`.

However, the program does not explicitly check if such a sequence can be constructed and might produce a sequence that does not satisfy the constraints. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the program correctly identifies impossible cases like `2 2 2 3` and outputs "NO" instead of a potentially invalid sequence.
