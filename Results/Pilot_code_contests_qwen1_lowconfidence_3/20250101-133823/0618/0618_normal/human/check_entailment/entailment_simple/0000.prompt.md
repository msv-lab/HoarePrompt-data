You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: An integer sequence is called beautiful if the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 1. More formally, a sequence s_1, s_2, …, s_{n} is beautiful if |s_i - s_{i+1}| = 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1.

Trans has a numbers 0, b numbers 1, c numbers 2 and d numbers 3. He wants to construct a beautiful sequence using all of these a + b + c + d numbers.

However, it turns out to be a non-trivial task, and Trans was not able to do it. Could you please help Trans?

Input

The only input line contains four non-negative integers a, b, c and d (0 < a+b+c+d ≤ 10^5).

Output

If it is impossible to construct a beautiful sequence satisfying the above constraints, print "NO" (without quotes) in one line.

Otherwise, print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. Then in the second line print a + b + c + d integers, separated by spaces — a beautiful sequence. There should be a numbers equal to 0, b numbers equal to 1, c numbers equal to 2 and d numbers equal to 3.

If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

Examples

Input


2 2 2 1


Output


YES
0 1 0 1 2 3 2


Input


1 2 3 4


Output


NO


Input


2 2 2 3


Output


NO

Note

In the first test, it is easy to see, that the sequence is beautiful because the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 1. Also, there are exactly two numbers, equal to 0, 1, 2 and exactly one number, equal to 3.

It can be proved, that it is impossible to construct beautiful sequences in the second and third tests.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
