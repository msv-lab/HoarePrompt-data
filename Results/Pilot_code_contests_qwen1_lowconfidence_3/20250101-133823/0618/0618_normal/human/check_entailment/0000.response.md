Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all possible cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate a valid sequence when the counts of `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3` do not allow for a valid sequence that satisfies the condition of being beautiful. 

For instance, consider the input `1 2 3 4`. According to the problem description, it should output "NO" since it is impossible to form a beautiful sequence with these counts. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly and will produce an output sequence instead of indicating that no valid sequence exists. This can be seen in the provided solution where the program attempts to construct a sequence without checking if such a sequence is actually possible, leading to incorrect outputs for invalid inputs.
