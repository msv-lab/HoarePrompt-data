You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An integer sequence is called beautiful if the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 1. More formally, a sequence s_1, s_2, …, s_{n} is beautiful if |s_i - s_{i+1}| = 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1.

Trans has a numbers 0, b numbers 1, c numbers 2 and d numbers 3. He wants to construct a beautiful sequence using all of these a + b + c + d numbers.

However, it turns out to be a non-trivial task, and Trans was not able to do it. Could you please help Trans?

Input

The only input line contains four non-negative integers a, b, c and d (0 < a+b+c+d ≤ 10^5).

Output

If it is impossible to construct a beautiful sequence satisfying the above constraints, print "NO" (without quotes) in one line.

Otherwise, print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. Then in the second line print a + b + c + d integers, separated by spaces — a beautiful sequence. There should be a numbers equal to 0, b numbers equal to 1, c numbers equal to 2 and d numbers equal to 3.

If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

Examples

Input


2 2 2 1


Output


YES
0 1 0 1 2 3 2


Input


1 2 3 4


Output


NO


Input


2 2 2 3


Output


NO

Note

In the first test, it is easy to see, that the sequence is beautiful because the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 1. Also, there are exactly two numbers, equal to 0, 1, 2 and exactly one number, equal to 3.

It can be proved, that it is impossible to construct beautiful sequences in the second and third tests.

    print('YES')

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It constructs a list `out` based on the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` which represent the counts of numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively in the sequence to be constructed. The function first calls another function `func_3` to get the initial values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. It then calculates two differences `s1` and `s2` where `s1 = b - a` and `s2 = c - d`.

- If `s1 == s2`, the function constructs the output list `out` using the pattern `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d`.

- If `s1 + 1 == s2`:
  - If `a > 0`, it decreases `a` by 1, sets `s1` to 0, and `s2` to 1, and constructs the output list `out` as `[0] + [1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d`.
  - If `a == 0`, it decreases `c` by 1 and sets `s1` to `b` and `s2` to `c - 1 - d`, and constructs the output list `out` as `[2] + [1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d`.

- If `s1 == s2 + 1`:
  - If `d > 0`, it decreases `d` by 1, sets `s1` to `-1`, and `s2` to `a - 2`, and constructs the output list `out` as `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d + [3]`.
  - If `d == 0`, it decreases `b` by 1, sets `s1` to `-1`, and `s2` to `a - 2`, and constructs the output list `out` as `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d + [1]`.

- If none of the above conditions are met, the function prints 'NO' and exits without constructing the output list.

Finally, if the function completes successfully, it prints 'YES' followed by the constructed output list `out`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers.
def func_2(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'x' is equal to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of 'x' and 'y', 'y' is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x which is equal to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y, given that y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function enters a loop where it repeatedly updates `x` and `y` such that `x` becomes `y` and `y` becomes `x % y` until `y` becomes 0. At this point, `x` contains the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function then returns `x`. Potential edge cases include when either `x` or `y` is 0; in such cases, the function correctly returns the non-zero value as the GCD. If both `x` and `y` are 0, the function will enter an infinite loop because the condition `while y:` will always be true, and `x % y` will not be defined. Therefore, the function should handle the case where both `x` and `y` are 0 by raising an exception or returning a specific value to indicate an error.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers separated by spaces and provided as input, with the constraint 0 < a + b + c + d ≤ 10^5.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #[a, b, c, d]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts no parameters directly. It reads a single string input from the standard input, which should consist of four non-negative integers separated by spaces. It then processes this input to split it into individual integers and convert them into a list. The function returns this list `[a, b, c, d]`. The function enforces the constraint that the sum of these integers should be less than or equal to \(10^5\), though this constraint is not checked within the function itself. Therefore, the final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns a list of four non-negative integers provided as input.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: f is a callable function, and dim is a variable-length tuple of positive integers representing the dimensions of a nested list structure to be generated. The length of dim determines the depth of nesting, and each element in dim represents the size of the list at each level of nesting.
def func_4(f):
    return [func_4(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #A list of `dim[0]` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_4(f, *dim[1:])`, or the result of calling `f()` if `dim` is an empty tuple
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a callable function `f` and a variable-length tuple `dim` of positive integers. If `dim` is empty, it returns the result of calling `f()`. Otherwise, it returns a list of `dim[0]` elements, where each element is the result of recursively calling `func_4(f, *dim[1:])`. This process continues until `dim` becomes empty, at which point `f()` is called. The function effectively generates a nested list structure based on the dimensions specified in `dim`, with each leaf node being the result of calling `f()`.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing the starting number of the sequence, step is an integer representing the difference between consecutive numbers (which is always 1 in this context), and count is a non-negative integer representing the number of elements in the sequence.
def func_5(start, step, count):
    return range(start, start + step * count, step)
    #range(start, start + count, 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts three parameters: `start`, `step`, and `count`. It returns a range object starting from `start`, ending at `start + step * count`, with a step of `step`. If `step` is 1, the range will have `count` elements, otherwise, it will have `(start + step * count - start) // step` elements. Potential edge cases include when `step` is 0 or negative, which would result in an invalid range object or an empty range. The function does not handle these edge cases, so it is important to ensure that `step` is a positive integer.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list containing four non-negative integers representing the counts of numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively (a, b, c, d), where 0 < sum(l) ≤ 10^5. start and end are non-negative integers representing the starting and ending indices for generating a range, with default values of 0.
def func_6(l, start, end):
    return range(start, len(l) + end)
    #The program returns a range object starting from 'start' (default is 0) and ending at 'len(l) + end' (default is len(l))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts a list `l` containing four non-negative integers representing the counts of numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively, where the sum of the elements in `l` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^5\). It also accepts two optional parameters `start` and `end`, both defaulting to 0. After executing the function, it returns a range object starting from `start` (default is 0) and ending at `len(l) + end` (default is `len(l)`).

The function does not modify the input list `l` in any way. If `end` is specified and is greater than `len(l)`, the function still returns a range object up to `len(l)`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations that need special handling within the code itself, as the code directly constructs the range object based on the provided parameters without additional checks.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5.
def func_7(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()
    #The program returns the bit length of 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a positive integer `n` within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and returns the bit length of 2. Since `2

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the count of a specific number in the sequence, and r is an integer representing the target number value (0, 1, 2, or 3) such that 0 <= x <= 10^5 and 1 <= r <= 3.
def func_8(x, r):
    return (x + r - 1) // r
    #The program returns ((x + r - 1) // r), where 'x' is the count of a specific number in the sequence and 'r' is the target number value (1, 2, or 3)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts two parameters: `x` and `r`. `x` represents the count of a specific number in the sequence, and `r` is the target number value, which can be 1, 2, or 3. The function calculates and returns the integer division of `(x + r - 1)` by `r`. This means it computes the ceiling of the division of `x` by `r`. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function handles the case where `r` is 1 correctly, as `(x + 1 - 1) // 1` simplifies to `x`. However, it is worth noting that for `r = 1`, the result is simply `x`, which is already handled by the given formula. The function also implicitly handles the case where `x` is 0, as `(0 + r - 1) // r` would be `0` for any valid `r`. Therefore, the function correctly computes the desired value without any missing logic.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
