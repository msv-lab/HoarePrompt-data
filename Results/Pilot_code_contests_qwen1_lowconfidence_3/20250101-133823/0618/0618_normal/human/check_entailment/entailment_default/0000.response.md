Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not always generate a valid sequence that satisfies the conditions of the problem description. Specifically, the code does not handle the case where the differences between the counts of adjacent numbers in the sequence do not align properly. For instance, if the counts of numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3 do not allow for a valid sequence to be constructed, the code should print "NO". However, the current implementation only checks certain specific conditions and does not cover all possible scenarios.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1 1 1 1
```

This input should result in "NO" because it is impossible to construct a sequence where the counts of 0, 1, 2, and 3 can form a beautiful sequence. The provided code does not handle this case correctly and instead tries to construct a sequence, which leads to incorrect outputs in other cases as well.
