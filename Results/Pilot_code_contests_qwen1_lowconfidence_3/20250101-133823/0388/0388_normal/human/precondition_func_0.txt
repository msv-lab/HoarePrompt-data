n and i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 4 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ i ≤ 10^8. The list ca is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a unique integer from the input array and its frequency. The variable md is the maximum number of distinct values allowed after compression, calculated as 2^(8 * i / n), which ensures that the compressed file fits into I bytes.
