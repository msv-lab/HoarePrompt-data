Output State: **`sep` is a string `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and the content of `sys.stdout` is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by the value of `sep`.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial Values**: 
  - `sep` is a string `' '`.
  - `file` is `sys.stdout`.
  - `at_start` is `True`.

- **Loop Execution**:
  - The loop iterates over each element `x` in `args`.
  - The first iteration sets `at_start` to `False` and writes the first element `x` to `sys.stdout` without a separator.
  - Subsequent iterations append the separator (`sep`) and then write the next element `x` to `sys.stdout`.
  - After all iterations, `at_start` remains `False` because it is set to `False` in every iteration.

- **Final State**:
  - `sep` remains `' '` because its value is not changed within the loop.
  - `file` remains `sys.stdout` because its value is not changed within the loop.
  - `at_start` is `False` because it is set to `False` in every iteration.
  - The content of `sys.stdout` will be the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by the value of `sep` (which is `' '`).

Thus, the final output state is that `sep` is a string `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and the content of `sys.stdout` is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by the value of `sep`.
