The variable `at_start` is set to `False`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is a string ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` must have at least one more element; the content of `sys.stdout` is the previous content plus a space followed by the string representation of `x`.
