`file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to `file`, which is initially set to `sys.stdout`. The `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` method pops the 'end' key from `kwargs` if it exists, using '\n' as the default value if 'end' is not found. Since `kwargs` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it does not contain the 'end' key, thus `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` returns '\n'. This value is then written to `sys.stdout`.

The values of `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, and the content of `sys.stdout` (which is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by the value of `sep`) are not directly affected by this line of code. However, the content of `sys.stdout` will now include the newline character `\n` at the end.

Output State: **`sep` is a string `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and the content of `sys.stdout` is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by the value of `sep`, followed by a newline character `\n`.**
