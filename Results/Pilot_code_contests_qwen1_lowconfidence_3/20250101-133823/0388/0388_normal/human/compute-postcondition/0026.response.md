The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly in the given code snippet. However, based on the constraints and relationships provided, the function likely operates on the following inputs:

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4 \cdot 10^5\).
- `i` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq i \leq 10^8\).
- `ca` is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a unique integer from the input array and its frequency.
- `md` is the maximum number of distinct values allowed after compression, calculated as \(2^{8 \cdot i / n}\).

Given the nature of the problem, the function is expected to perform some form of data compression or filtering based on the provided parameters.

Output:
- The function may return a compressed or filtered list of tuples based on the maximum number of distinct values (`md`).

Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list `ca` of tuples containing unique integers and their frequencies, along with two integers `n` and `i`. It calculates `md` as \(2^{8 \cdot i / n}\) and returns a compressed or filtered list of tuples based on the maximum number of distinct values allowed (`md`).**
