Postcondition: **`sep` is a string `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and the content of `sys.stdout` is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by the value of `sep`, followed by a newline character `\n`. The `kwargs` dictionary has been modified such that the key `'flush'` is popped with the value `False` if it exists.**
