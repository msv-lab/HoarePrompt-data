The code writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. Since `file` is `sys.stdout` and `at_start` is `False`, the output will be written to the standard output with a space preceding it. However, the value of `x` is not provided, so we cannot specify its exact value in the output state. The only change is that `sys.stdout` will now contain the previous content plus the string representation of `x` with a preceding space.

Output State: **`sep` is a string ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` must have at least one more element; the content of `sys.stdout` is the previous content plus a space followed by the string representation of `x`.**
