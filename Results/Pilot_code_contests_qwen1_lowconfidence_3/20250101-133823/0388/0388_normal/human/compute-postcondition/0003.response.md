According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop will execute if `args` contains at least one element.

Before the loop starts, the following states are given:
- `sep` is a string ' '
- `file` is `sys.stdout`
- `at_start` is `True`

To ensure the loop can execute, `args` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this condition.

State: **`sep` is a string ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`, `args` must have at least one element**
