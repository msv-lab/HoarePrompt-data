The code assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `at_start`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `at_start` and retains the initial states of `sep` and `file`.

Output State: **`sep` is a string ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`**
