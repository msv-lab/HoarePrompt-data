The code assigns default values to `sep` and `file` using the `kwargs.pop` method. Specifically, `sep` is assigned the value `' '` (a single space) if it is not already in `kwargs`, and `file` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout` if it is not already in `kwargs`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`sep` is a string ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, and all other variables retain their initial states.**
