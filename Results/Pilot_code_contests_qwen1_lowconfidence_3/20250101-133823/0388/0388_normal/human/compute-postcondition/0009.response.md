According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop iterates over each element in `args`. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` is a string ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `False`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
- `args` must have at least one remaining element.

At the end of the previous iteration, `at_start` is `False`, indicating that we are not at the beginning of processing the arguments. The variable `sep` remains unchanged, and `file` remains `sys.stdout`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `args` must have at least one more element.

State: **`sep` is a string ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` must have at least one more element**
