`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is a string ' ') to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). This does not change the value of `sep`, `file`, or `at_start`, but it affects the content written to `sys.stdout`. The `args` precondition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`sep` is a string ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` must have at least one more element; `sys.stdout` has a space (' ') written to it.**
