Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `sep` is a string `' '`
   - `file` is `sys.stdout`
   - `at_start` is `False`
   - `args` must have at least one more element
   - The content of `sys.stdout` is the previous content plus a space followed by the string representation of `x`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `args`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - We know that at the end of the previous iteration, `args` had at least one more element.
   - `at_start` was `False`, indicating that the separator (`' '`) has already been added to `sys.stdout`.
   - The content of `sys.stdout` is the previous content plus a space followed by the string representation of `x`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must have at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration.
   - Since `at_start` is `False`, the separator (`' '`) will be added to `sys.stdout` if it hasn't been added yet (which it won't be because `at_start` is `False`).

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `sep` remains the same as `' '`.
   - `file` remains `sys.stdout`.
   - `at_start` remains `False` since the separator has already been added.
   - `args` must have at least two more elements (one more than it had at the end of the previous iteration).

6. **Content of `sys.stdout`:**
   - The content of `sys.stdout` will now include another element from `args` preceded by a space.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration are:

State: **`sep` is a string `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least two more elements, the content of `sys.stdout` is the previous content plus a space followed by the string representation of the next element in `args`.**
