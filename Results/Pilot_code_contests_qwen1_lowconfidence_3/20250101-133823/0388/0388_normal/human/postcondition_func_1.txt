This function prints the elements of `args` to `sys.stdout` (or another file if specified) separated by `sep` (defaulting to a space). After printing, it writes the value of `end` (defaulting to a newline) and flushes the output buffer if requested. If no arguments are provided, it simply writes the `end` value. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. Potential edge cases include handling empty `args`, different values for `sep` and `end`, and ensuring the output buffer is flushed if `flush` is set to `True`.
