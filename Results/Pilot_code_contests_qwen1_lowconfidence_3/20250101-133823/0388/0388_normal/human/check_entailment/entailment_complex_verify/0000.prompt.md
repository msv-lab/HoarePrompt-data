You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One common way of digitalizing sound is to record sound intensity at particular time moments. For each time moment intensity is recorded as a non-negative integer. Thus we can represent a sound file as an array of n non-negative integers.

If there are exactly K distinct values in the array, then we need k = ⌈ log_{2} K ⌉ bits to store each value. It then takes nk bits to store the whole file.

To reduce the memory consumption we need to apply some compression. One common way is to reduce the number of possible intensity values. We choose two integers l ≤ r, and after that all intensity values are changed in the following way: if the intensity value is within the range [l;r], we don't change it. If it is less than l, we change it to l; if it is greater than r, we change it to r. You can see that we lose some low and some high intensities.

Your task is to apply this compression in such a way that the file fits onto a disk of size I bytes, and the number of changed elements in the array is minimal possible.

We remind you that 1 byte contains 8 bits.

k = ⌈ log_{2} K ⌉ is the smallest integer such that K ≤ 2^{k}. In particular, if K = 1, then k = 0.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and I (1 ≤ n ≤ 4 ⋅ 10^{5}, 1 ≤ I ≤ 10^{8}) — the length of the array and the size of the disk in bytes, respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^{9}) — the array denoting the sound file.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimal possible number of changed elements.

Examples

Input


6 1
2 1 2 3 4 3


Output


2


Input


6 2
2 1 2 3 4 3


Output


0


Input


6 1
1 1 2 2 3 3


Output


2

Note

In the first example we can choose l=2, r=3. The array becomes 2 2 2 3 3 3, the number of distinct elements is K=2, and the sound file fits onto the disk. Only two values are changed.

In the second example the disk is larger, so the initial file fits it and no changes are required.

In the third example we have to change both 1s or both 3s.
Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
import os
import sys
from collections import Counter
from io import BytesIO, IOBase
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, i) = map(int, input().split())
    ca = sorted(Counter(map(int, input().split())).items(), key=lambda x: x[0])
    md = int(2 ** (8 * i / n))
    pref = [0]
    for (_, j) in ca:
        pref.append(pref[-1] + j)
    s = n
    for i in range(len(pref) - md):
        u = pref[i + md] - pref[i]
        s = min(s, n - u)
    if len(pref) - md <= 0:
        s = 0
    func_2(s)

#Function 2:
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the logic used to determine the minimal number of changed elements is flawed. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `md`:**
   - The variable `md` is calculated as `int(2 ** (8 * i / n))`, which determines the maximum number of distinct values that can fit into the given disk size. However, this calculation is not directly related to finding the optimal range `[l, r]` to minimize the number of changes.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Optimal Range:**
   - The program uses a prefix sum array (`pref`) to calculate the number of distinct elements within a range but does not correctly determine the optimal range `[l, r]`. The loop iterating from `i` to `len(pref) - md` is not designed to find the minimum number of changes.

3. **Function Definitions:**
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are defined but not used correctly. The main logic should be implemented directly without unnecessary function calls.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
6 1
2 1 2 3 4 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

However, the program might not output the correct result because it does not correctly determine the optimal range to minimize changes. A more straightforward approach would involve using a sliding window technique to find the optimal range `[l, r]` that minimizes the number of changes while ensuring the compressed file fits within the given disk size.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem as described, hence the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 4 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ i ≤ 10^8. The list ca is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a unique integer from the input array and its frequency. The variable md is the maximum number of distinct values allowed after compression, calculated as 2^(8 * i / n), which ensures that the compressed file fits into I bytes.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is the minimum value of `n` and `n - (pref[i + md] - pref[i])` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(pref) - md - 1`, `i` is `len(pref) - md - 1`, `u` is `pref[len(pref) - md - 1 + md] - pref[len(pref) - md - 1]`, and `len(pref) - md` must be at least `len(pref) - 1`.
    if (len(pref) - md <= 0) :
        s = 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is 0, `n` is the minimum value of `n` and `n - (pref[i + md] - pref[i])` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(pref) - md - 1`, `i` is `len(pref) - md - 1`, `u` is `pref[len(pref) - md - 1 + md] - pref[len(pref) - md - 1]`, and `len(pref) - md` is at most `len(pref) - 1`, because `len(pref) - md <= 0`.
    func_2(s)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` and `i`, and a sorted list `ca` of tuples containing unique integers and their frequencies. It calculates `md` as \(2^{8 \cdot i / n}\). The function then computes the minimum value of `n` and `n - (pref[i + md] - pref[i])` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(pref) - md - 1`. If `len(pref) - md <= 0`, it sets `s` to 0. Finally, it calls `func_2(s)` with the computed value of `s`. The function does not return anything but affects the variable `s` which is passed to `func_2`. Potential edge cases include when `len(pref) - md <= 0`, in which case `s` is set to 0. There is no missing functionality as described by the annotations.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not seem to be relevant to the problem described. It is a utility function for printing values and does not contain any parameters related to the sound file compression problem. Therefore, there are no precondition variables to describe for this function.

    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`sep` is a string `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and the content of `sys.stdout` is updated to reflect the buffered data being flushed. The `kwargs` dictionary no longer contains the key `'flush'` with the value `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function prints the elements of `args` to `sys.stdout` (or another file if specified) separated by `sep` (defaulting to a space). After printing, it writes the value of `end` (defaulting to a newline) and flushes the output buffer if requested. If no arguments are provided, it simply writes the `end` value. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. Potential edge cases include handling empty `args`, different values for `sep` and `end`, and ensuring the output buffer is flushed if `flush` is set to `True`.
