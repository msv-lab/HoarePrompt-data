Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the code calculates `md` as \(2^{8 \cdot i / n}\), which is incorrect according to the problem statement. The problem description states that \(k = \lceil \log_{2} K \rceil\) bits are needed to store each value, where \(K\) is the number of distinct values in the array. Therefore, the correct calculation for `md` should be \(2^{\lceil \log_{2} K \rceil}\).

The current implementation of `md` does not correctly reflect the number of bits required to store each distinct value. This leads to incorrect results for the number of bits required and subsequently the number of changed elements. As a result, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
