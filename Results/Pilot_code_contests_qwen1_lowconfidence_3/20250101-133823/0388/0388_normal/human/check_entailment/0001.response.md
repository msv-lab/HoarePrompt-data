Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimal number of changed elements is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `md`**: The variable `md` is calculated as `int(2 ** (8 * i / n))`, which does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of distinct values needed to fit the file into the given disk size. The formula used here is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the actual number of distinct values in the array and the required number of bits per value.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Distinct Values**: The program uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each distinct value but then attempts to directly calculate the minimal number of changed elements without properly considering the range `[l, r]` and the resulting number of distinct values.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Minimal Changes**: The program tries to minimize the number of changes by iterating over a sliding window of `md` length, but this approach does not guarantee finding the optimal solution. The logic for determining the minimal number of changed elements is overly simplistic and does not consider all possible valid ranges `[l, r]`.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
