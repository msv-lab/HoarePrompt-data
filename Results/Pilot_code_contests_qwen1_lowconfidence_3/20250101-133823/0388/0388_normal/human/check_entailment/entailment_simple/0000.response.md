Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. Specifically, the main issue lies in the logic used to find the minimum number of changed elements during the compression process. Let's analyze why the program fails to meet the problem requirements:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - The goal is to compress the sound file such that it fits within \( I \) bytes.
   - The number of distinct values should be minimized after compression.
   - The number of bits needed to represent each value is determined by \( k = \lceil \log_2 K \rceil \), where \( K \) is the number of distinct values in the original array.
   - The total space required is \( nk \) bits, which should fit within \( 8I \) bits (since \( 1 \) byte = \( 8 \) bits).

2. **Key Points in the Solution**:
   - The program calculates \( md = 2^{8 \cdot i / n} \), which determines the maximum number of distinct values allowed after compression.
   - The program iterates over the prefix sums (`pref`) to find the minimum number of changes needed.
   - However, the logic for finding the minimum number of changes is flawed.

3. **Flawed Logic**:
   - The program uses `pref[i + md] - pref[i]` to calculate the number of distinct values in the range `[i, i + md)`. This is not correct because `pref` only contains cumulative counts, and subtracting these values does not directly give the number of distinct values.
   - The calculation `n - (pref[i + md] - pref[i])` does not accurately represent the number of unchanged elements or the number of changes needed.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     6 1
     2 1 2 3 4 3
     ```
   - Here, \( n = 6 \), \( I = 1 \), and the array is `[2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3]`.
   - The program incorrectly calculates `md` as \( 2^{8 \cdot 1 / 6} \approx 3 \).
   - The program iterates over `pref` and calculates the number of unchanged elements, which is incorrect.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach would involve finding the optimal range `[l, r]` that minimizes the number of changes while ensuring the number of distinct values \( K \leq md \).
   - This requires more sophisticated algorithms like dynamic programming or binary search to find the optimal range.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is **False** according to the problem requirements.
