Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the logic used to determine the minimal number of changed elements is flawed. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `md`:**
   - The variable `md` is calculated as `int(2 ** (8 * i / n))`, which determines the maximum number of distinct values that can fit into the given disk size. However, this calculation is not directly related to finding the optimal range `[l, r]` to minimize the number of changes.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Optimal Range:**
   - The program uses a prefix sum array (`pref`) to calculate the number of distinct elements within a range but does not correctly determine the optimal range `[l, r]`. The loop iterating from `i` to `len(pref) - md` is not designed to find the minimum number of changes.

3. **Function Definitions:**
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are defined but not used correctly. The main logic should be implemented directly without unnecessary function calls.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
6 1
2 1 2 3 4 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

However, the program might not output the correct result because it does not correctly determine the optimal range to minimize changes. A more straightforward approach would involve using a sliding window technique to find the optimal range `[l, r]` that minimizes the number of changes while ensuring the compressed file fits within the given disk size.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem as described, hence the correctness is **False**.
