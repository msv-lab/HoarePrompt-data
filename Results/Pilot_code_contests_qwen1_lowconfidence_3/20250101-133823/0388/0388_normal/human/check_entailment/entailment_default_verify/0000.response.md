Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem as described. Specifically, the logic used to determine the minimal number of changed elements is flawed. The function `func_1` attempts to solve the problem but fails to correctly identify the optimal range `[l, r]` that minimizes the number of changes while ensuring the compressed file fits within the given disk size. The use of `func_2` for printing does not affect the correctness of the solution logic. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
