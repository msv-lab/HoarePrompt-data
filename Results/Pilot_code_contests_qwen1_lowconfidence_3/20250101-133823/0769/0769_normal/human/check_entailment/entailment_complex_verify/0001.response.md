Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not ensure the dices are in a standard orientation before comparison. The annotated version further clarifies that the `func_1` function only checks if the numbers in `dice1` are the same as those in `dice2` without aligning the top faces properly. Even though the function attempts to roll `dice1` to various orientations, it does not guarantee that `dice1` and `dice2` are in a standard position when comparing their configurations. 

Specifically, the annotated version shows that after the inner for loop, `dice1` might be in one of several orientations, and the outer for loop does not ensure that the top faces of `dice1` and `dice2` are aligned correctly. Therefore, the function `func_1` cannot reliably determine if the dices are different based on the problem description. This flaw means that the program's logic does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Hence, the final assessment remains **False**.
