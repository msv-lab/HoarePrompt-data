Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to check if two dice are the same by rolling the first die and comparing it to the second die. However, the output hints indicate that the function always returns `True`, even if the dice are not the same. This is problematic because it means the function will incorrectly determine that any two dice are the same, which violates the problem description.

To illustrate, consider two different dice with the following faces:
- Dice 1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Dice 2: 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6

According to the problem description, these dice should be considered different. However, the function `func_1` would incorrectly determine that they are the same due to the incorrect implementation. This indicates that the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
