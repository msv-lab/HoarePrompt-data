Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the orientation of the dice before comparison. Specifically, the function only checks if the dice have the same numbers configuration without ensuring they are in a standard orientation. The output hints confirm this issue by indicating that the function rolls the dice multiple times but still returns `True` regardless of the outcome, leading to incorrect comparisons. This behavior violates the requirement to ensure the dices are in a standard position before determining if they are different. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and should be marked as incorrect.
