Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the problem description states that the program should read \( n \) dices and determine whether they are all different. The program attempts to achieve this by comparing each pair of dices to see if they can be made identical through rotations. However, there are several issues:

1. **Incorrect Functionality for Determining if Dices Are Different:**
   - The function `func_1(dice1, dice2)` checks if two dices are equal or can be made equal through rotations. However, this approach does not correctly determine if the dices are all different. Instead, it should check if any permutation of one dice can match the other dice. 

2. **Incomplete Implementation of Comparison Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` only checks a few orientations and does not ensure that all possible orientations are considered. The logic inside `func_1` is incomplete and does not cover all permutations of the dice faces.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints "Yes" if the dices are all different and "No" otherwise. However, the problem description specifies that the output should be "Yes" if the dices are all different and "No" if they are not. The program correctly outputs "No" if at least one pair of dices can be made identical, but it fails to output "Yes" when all dices are different.

To correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement, the program should:

- Use a more comprehensive method to compare the dices.
- Ensure that all possible orientations of the dices are checked.
- Correctly output "Yes" when all dices are different and "No" otherwise.

Here is a simplified example of how the comparison logic could be implemented:

```python
from itertools import permutations

def is_different(dice1, dice2):
    for perm in permutations(range(1, 7)):
        if all(dice1[i] == dice2[perm[i-1]] for i in range(1, 7)):
            return False
    return True

dice_number = int(input())
dices = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(dice_number)]

for i in range(dice_number - 1):
    for j in range(i + 1, dice_number):
        if not is_different(dices[i], dices[j]):
            print("No")
            exit()

print("Yes")
```

This code uses permutations to check all possible orientations of the dice and ensures that the dices are all different.
