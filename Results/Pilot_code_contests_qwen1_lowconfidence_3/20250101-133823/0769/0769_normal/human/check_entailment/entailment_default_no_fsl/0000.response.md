Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the requirement to check if all dices are different according to the rules described in Dice III. The function `func_1` is designed to check if two dices are the same, but it always returns `True` after rolling the dice, which means it incorrectly identifies any two dices as the same, regardless of their actual configuration. 

This is evident from the output hints, which indicate that the function always returns `True` after rolling the dice, even if the dices are not the same. Specifically, the hint mentions that the function returns `True` with `i` being 5, meaning it performs a default action or an error handling mechanism that causes it to always return `True`.

To meet the problem description, the function should return `False` if the dices are not the same, and only return `True` if they are identical after attempting all possible rotations. However, the current implementation does not perform these checks correctly.

Given this analysis, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and therefore is incorrect.
