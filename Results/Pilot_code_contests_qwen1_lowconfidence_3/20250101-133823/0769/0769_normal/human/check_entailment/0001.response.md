Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the dices are not rolled to a standard orientation before comparison. According to the problem description, we need to ensure that the dices are compared after being rotated to a standard position. However, the program does not guarantee that the top faces of the dices are aligned properly before checking if they are different.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
1 2 3 4 5 6
6 5 4 3 2 1
5 4 3 2 1 6
```

The first and third dices have the same top faces when rotated, but the program does not check this correctly. The `func_1` function only checks if the dices have the same numbers configuration without ensuring they are in a standard orientation. This leads to the program incorrectly identifying the dices as different.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that both dices are in a standard orientation before comparing their configurations. This can be achieved by setting the top face of each dice to a specific value (e.g., 1) and then rolling them to a standard position.
