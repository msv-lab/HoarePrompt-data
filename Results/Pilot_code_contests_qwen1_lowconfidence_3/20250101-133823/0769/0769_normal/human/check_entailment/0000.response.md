Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly determine whether the given dices are all different. The main issue lies in the `func_1` function, which is responsible for comparing two dices. This function checks if the two dices are the same by rotating the first dice and comparing it with the second dice. However, it does not account for all possible rotations and orientations of the dices, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
- Dice 1: Faces = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
- Dice 2: Faces = [6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

In this case, the dices are different, but the program might incorrectly determine them to be the same because the comparison logic does not cover all possible orientations.

The correct approach would involve checking all possible orientations of the dices, not just a limited set of moves. Here is a more comprehensive way to check if two dices are the same:

```python
def are_dice_same(dice1, dice2):
    # Check all possible orientations of the dices
    for top1 in range(6):
        for front1 in range(4):  # 4 because we can rotate the top to 4 positions
            dice1.set_top(top1 + 1)
            dice1.roll_dice('SWN' * front1)
            for top2 in range(6):
                for front2 in range(4):
                    dice2.set_top(top2 + 1)
                    dice2.roll_dice('SWN' * front2)
                    if dice1.numbers == dice2.numbers:
                        return True
    return False

def func_1(dice1, dice2):
    return not are_dice_same(dice1, dice2)

# Rest of the code remains the same...
```

This modified `func_1` function ensures that all possible orientations of the dices are checked, thus providing a more accurate comparison.
