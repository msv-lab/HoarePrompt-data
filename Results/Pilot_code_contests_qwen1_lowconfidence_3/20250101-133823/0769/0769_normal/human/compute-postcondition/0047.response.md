`dice1.roll_dice('SWN')` rolls the dice and assigns the result to the last element of the `dice1.numbers` list. The previous value of `j` is 3, `dice1.numbers` is a list of five integers (with the last being the result of `dice1.roll_dice('SWN')`), `dice2` is a list of six integers, `flag` is True, and `i` is 5. After rolling the dice, the last element of `dice1.numbers` will be updated with the new roll result.

Output State: **`j` is 3, `dice1.numbers` is a list of five integers with the last element updated to the result of `dice1.roll_dice('SWN')`, `dice2` is a list of six integers, `flag` is True, and `i` is 5**
