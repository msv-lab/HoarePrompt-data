The variable `flag` is set to `True`. The values of the other variables (`dice1`, `dice2`, `j`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `dice1` is in a new state resulting from the roll, `dice2` is a list of six integers, `flag` is True, `j` is 0, and the numbers of `dice1` are equal to the numbers in `dice2`.

Output State: **`dice1` is in a new state resulting from the roll, `dice2` is a list of six integers, `flag` is True, `j` is 0, and the numbers of `dice1` are equal to the numbers in `dice2`.**
