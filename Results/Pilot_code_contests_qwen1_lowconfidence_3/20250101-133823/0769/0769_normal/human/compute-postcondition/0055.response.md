`dice1.roll_dice('S')` is called, which updates the first element of the `dice1.numbers` list with a new value obtained from rolling the dice in 'S' mode. The value of `j` and `dice2` remain unchanged, and `flag` also remains True.

To find the new value for the first element of `dice1.numbers`, we assume `dice1.roll_dice('S')` returns a new integer value. Since no specific value is provided, we denote the new value as `new_value`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `j` is 4
- `dice1.numbers[0]` is updated to `new_value`
- `dice1.numbers[1]` to `dice1.numbers[4]` remain the same as their previous values, each being the result of `dice1.roll_dice('SWN')`
- `dice2` remains unchanged
- `flag` remains True

Output State: **`j` is 4; `dice1.numbers[0]` is `new_value`, `dice1.numbers[1]` to `dice1.numbers[4]` remain the same as their previous values, each being the result of `dice1.roll_dice('SWN')`; `dice2` remains unchanged; `flag` remains True**
