The code simply reassigns `flag` to `True`, which does not change its current value since it was already `True`. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dice1` is in a new state resulting from the roll, `dice2` is a list of six integers, `flag` is True, and `j` is 1**
