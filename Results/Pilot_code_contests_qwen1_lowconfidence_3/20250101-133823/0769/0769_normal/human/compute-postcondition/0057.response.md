Postcondition: ***`dice1` and `dice2` are lists of six integers. If `dice1` and `dice2` have the same numbers, then `flag` is set to True. Otherwise, `dice1` is a sequence of six integers resulting from rolling dice1 four times for each face (with the last roll being the result of `dice1.roll_dice('S')`), `dice2` is a list of six integers, and `flag` is set to True with `i` being 5.***
