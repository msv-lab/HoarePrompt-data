Postcondition: ***`dice1` is in a new state resulting from the roll (a random integer between 1 and 6), `dice2` is a list of six integers, `flag` is True, and `j` is 2. If `dice1.numbers` equals `dice2.numbers`, then no change occurs. Since there is no else part, the state remains as described in the if part.***
