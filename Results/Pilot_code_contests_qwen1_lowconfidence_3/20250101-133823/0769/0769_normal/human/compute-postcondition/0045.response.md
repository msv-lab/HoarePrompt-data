Postcondition: ***`j` is less than 4, `dice1.numbers` is a list of five integers (last being the result of `dice1.roll_dice('SWN')`), `dice2` is a list of six integers, `flag` is True, and `i` is 5. If `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers`, the postcondition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the condition evaluation.***
