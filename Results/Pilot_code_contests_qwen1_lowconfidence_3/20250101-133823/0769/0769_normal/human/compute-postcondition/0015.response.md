Postcondition: ***`dice1` is in a new state resulting from the roll, `dice2` is a list of six integers, `flag` is True, and `j` is 1. If `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers`, the condition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the flag and other variables retain their initial states.***
