Output State: **`dice1` is a list of six integers, `dice2` is a list of six integers** 

Explanation: The provided code is a docstring (documentation comment) for a function that compares two dice. However, the actual comparison logic is missing. Since no code is executed, the variables `dice1` and `dice2` remain unchanged from their initial state. The function's docstring does not affect the variables themselves.
