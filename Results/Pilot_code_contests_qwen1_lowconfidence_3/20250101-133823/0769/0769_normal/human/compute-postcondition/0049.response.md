Postcondition: ***`j` is 3, `dice1.numbers` is a list of five integers with the last element updated to the result of `dice1.roll_dice('SWN')`, `dice2` is a list of six integers, and `flag` remains True. If `dice1.numbers` equals `dice2.numbers`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made since there is no else part provided.***
