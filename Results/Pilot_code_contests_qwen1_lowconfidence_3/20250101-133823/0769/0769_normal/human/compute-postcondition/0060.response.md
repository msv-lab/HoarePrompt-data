Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `dice1` and `dice2`, both of which are lists of six integers representing the faces of two dice. The function checks if the numbers in `dice1` are exactly the same as those in `dice2`. If they are identical, the function sets the boolean `flag` to `True` and returns it. If they are not identical, the function rolls `dice1` four times for each face, except the last one, and checks again if the numbers match `dice2`. After these operations, regardless of whether the numbers matched or not, the function returns `True` with `i` being 5. This behavior ensures that even if the initial comparison fails, the function still returns `True`, possibly indicating a default action or an error handling mechanism.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `dice1` and `dice2` are already equal, the function returns `True` immediately without any further operations.
- If the numbers do not match after rolling `dice1` multiple times, the function still returns `True` with `i` being 5, indicating a potential fallback or default behavior.
