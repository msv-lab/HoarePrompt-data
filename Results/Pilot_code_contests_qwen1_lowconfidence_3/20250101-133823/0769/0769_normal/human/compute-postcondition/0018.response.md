The code `flag = True` does not change the value of `flag` because it is already set to `True`. The values of `dice1`, `dice2`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dice1` is in a new state resulting from the roll (a random integer between 1 and 6), `dice2` is a list of six integers, `flag` is True, and `j` is 2.

Output State: **`dice1` is in a new state resulting from the roll (a random integer between 1 and 6), `dice2` is a list of six integers, `flag` is True, and `j` is 2**
