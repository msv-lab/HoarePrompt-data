Postcondition: ***`j` is 4, `dice1.numbers` is a list of five integers with the last element updated to the result of `dice1.roll_dice('SWN')`, `dice2` is a list of six integers, and `flag` remains True. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same regardless of the if condition.***
