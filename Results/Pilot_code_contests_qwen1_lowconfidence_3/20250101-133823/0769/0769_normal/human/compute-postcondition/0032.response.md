Postcondition: ***`j` is 4, `dice1.numbers` is `new_dice1_numbers`, `dice2` is a list of six integers, `flag` is True, and `i` is 4. If `dice1.numbers` equals `dice2.numbers`, the program maintains these conditions. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same regardless of the if condition evaluation.***
