`dice1.roll_dice('SWN')` is a method call that rolls the dice in the direction specified ('SWN'). However, the exact outcome of rolling the dice is not specified in the code snippet, and the `roll_dice` method does not return a value. Therefore, the variables `j`, `dice1.numbers`, `dice2`, `flag`, and `i` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `dice1.numbers` is now 5, `dice2` is a list of six integers, `flag` is True, and `i` is 4**
