The method `roll_dice('SWN')` is called on `dice1`. However, the specifics of this method (what it does to `dice1`) are not provided in the problem statement. Without knowing the exact behavior of the `roll_dice` method, we cannot determine the exact new state of `dice1`. Given that `dice1` is in a new state resulting from the roll and assuming the method modifies `dice1` to a random value between 1 and 6, the updated state would reflect this.

The states of the other variables (`dice2`, `flag`, and `j`) are not affected by this method call.

Output State: **`dice1` is in a new state resulting from the roll (a random integer between 1 and 6), `dice2` is a list of six integers, `flag` is True, and `j` is 2**
