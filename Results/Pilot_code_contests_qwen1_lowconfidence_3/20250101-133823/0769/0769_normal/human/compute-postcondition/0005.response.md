Let's break down the given information and the for loop statement step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `dice1` is a list of six integers.
- `dice2` is a list of six integers.
- `flag` is `False`.
- The numbers in `dice1` are not equal to the numbers in `dice2`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(6):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **The loop itself**: The loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = 5`, inclusive. This means that the loop will always execute exactly 6 times regardless of the initial values of `dice1` and `dice2` or the value of `flag`.

2. **Dependencies of the loop execution**:
   - Since the loop runs 6 times regardless of the specific values of `dice1`, `dice2`, and `flag`, none of these variables directly control the loop execution.
   - The loop will run as long as the condition `i` in the range(6) is satisfied, which is always true for the specified range.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `dice1` and `dice2` being lists of six integers and not having equal numbers are given conditions but do not affect the loop's ability to execute.
   - `flag` being `False` initially does not affect the loop's execution either since the loop does not depend on `flag` for its continuation.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop will always execute 6 times due to the range specified (`range(6)`), there is no need to adjust the initial state of `dice1`, `dice2`, or `flag` for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`dice1` is a list of six integers, `dice2` is a list of six integers, `flag` is False**
