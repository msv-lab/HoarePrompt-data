Output State: **`dice1` is in a new state resulting from the roll, `dice2` is a list of six integers, `flag` is True, and `j` is 3. If `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers` at any point during the loop, `flag` will be set to True and the loop will break. If `dice1.numbers` is never equal to `dice2.numbers` after all iterations, `flag` will remain False.**
