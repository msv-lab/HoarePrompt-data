The method `roll_dice('SWN')` is called on `dice1`. This method likely rolls the dice in a specific direction ('SWN' presumably stands for South, West, North), but the exact implementation details are not provided. Given the initial state and without further specifics on what the `roll_dice` method does, we can infer that `dice1` will be updated based on the roll.

Since the method name suggests a roll, and assuming it updates `dice1` with a new value, we'll denote this new value as `new_value`. However, since the actual value after rolling is not specified, we'll keep the state in terms of its post-rolling condition.

The other variables (`dice2`, `flag`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dice1` is in a new state resulting from the roll, `dice2` is a list of six integers, `flag` is True, and `j` is 1**
