Let's break down the given information and the for loop to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `dice1.numbers` is now 5
- `dice2` is a list of six integers
- `flag` is True
- `i` is 4

### For Loop:
```
for j in xrange(4):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j < 4`.
2. **Variable `j`**: The loop iterates over the values `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3`.

### States to Adjust:
- **`j`**: The loop will start with `j = 0` and increment until `j < 4`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the loop can start with `j` being `0`.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` is mentioned in the given information but is not directly involved in the for loop condition. Hence, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
- **Other Variables**: The variables `dice1.numbers`, `dice2`, and `flag` are not directly related to the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted unless they affect the loop execution (which they do not in this case).

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to ensure the loop can start with `j = 0`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`j` is 0, dice1.numbers is now 5, dice2 is a list of six integers, flag is True, and i is 4**
