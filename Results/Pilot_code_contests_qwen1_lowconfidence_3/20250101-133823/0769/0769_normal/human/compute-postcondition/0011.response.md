Postcondition: ***`dice1` is in a new state resulting from the roll, `dice2` is a list of six integers, `flag` is True, and `j` is 0. This occurs if the numbers of `dice1` are equal to the numbers in `dice2`. If the numbers do not match, the values of `dice1`, `dice2`, `flag`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
