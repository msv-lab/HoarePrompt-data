The variable `flag` is assigned the value `True`. The initial state indicates that `dice1` and `dice2` are lists containing the same six integers, and `flag` is initially `False`. After executing the code, `flag` changes to `True`, but the lists `dice1` and `dice2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dice1` is a list of six integers, `dice2` is a list of six integers, `flag` is True**
