The method `roll_dice('SWN')` is called on `dice1`. This method likely rolls the dice in the specified directions ('SWN'), which stands for South, West, and North. However, since the exact behavior of the `roll_dice` method is not provided, we can only infer that it modifies the state of `dice1`.

Given the initial state:
- `dice1` is a list of six integers.
- `dice2` is a list of six integers.
- `flag` is `False`.
- `j` is `0`.

Since the method `roll_dice('SWN')` is called on `dice1`, the list `dice1` will be modified. However, without knowing the exact transformation applied by `roll_dice('SWN')`, we can only state that `dice1` is now in a new state resulting from the roll.

Output State: **`dice1` is in a new state resulting from the roll, `dice2` is a list of six integers, `flag` is False, `j` is 0**.
