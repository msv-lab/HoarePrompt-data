Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program uses `index` which is not defined in the provided code. This leads to a NameError when running the function `func_3`. Additionally, the logic within `func_3` is flawed. For instance, when `max(x, y, z) < 1`, it should directly call `func_1` with the appropriate values, but instead, it iterates over an undefined `index`. This indicates that the program is not fully implemented and thus does not meet the problem description requirements for every potential case.
