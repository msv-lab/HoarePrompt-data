Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_3` has a conditional branch that handles the scenario where the maximum value among \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) is less than 1, and it uses `func_1` for those cases. However, `func_1` is only designed to handle specific cases of `k` (1 through 12), and it does not return a value if `k` is outside this range. This means that if `k` is not one of the specified values, the function will return `None`, leading to incorrect behavior.

Additionally, the problem statement specifies that Rat Kwesh will choose the best option from 12 possible expressions. However, the functions provided do not cover all 12 cases for every possible combination of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). For instance, if \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are all greater than 1, the code should evaluate all 12 expressions using both `func_1` and `func_2` and return the maximum value along with its corresponding expression. The current implementation of `func_3` only evaluates `func_2` in this scenario, which is incomplete.

To ensure correctness, the code should iterate over all 12 expressions and compare their results to find the maximum value, regardless of whether the maximum value among \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) is less than 1 or not.
