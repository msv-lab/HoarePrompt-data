You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Wet Shark asked Rat Kwesh to generate three positive real numbers x, y and z, from 0.1 to 200.0, inclusive. Wet Krash wants to impress Wet Shark, so all generated numbers will have exactly one digit after the decimal point.

Wet Shark knows Rat Kwesh will want a lot of cheese. So he will give the Rat an opportunity to earn a lot of cheese. He will hand the three numbers x, y and z to Rat Kwesh, and Rat Kwesh will pick one of the these twelve options:

  1. a1 = xyz; 
  2. a2 = xzy; 
  3. a3 = (xy)z; 
  4. a4 = (xz)y; 
  5. a5 = yxz; 
  6. a6 = yzx; 
  7. a7 = (yx)z; 
  8. a8 = (yz)x; 
  9. a9 = zxy; 
  10. a10 = zyx; 
  11. a11 = (zx)y; 
  12. a12 = (zy)x. 



Let m be the maximum of all the ai, and c be the smallest index (from 1 to 12) such that ac = m. Rat's goal is to find that c, and he asks you to help him. Rat Kwesh wants to see how much cheese he gets, so he you will have to print the expression corresponding to that ac.

Input

The only line of the input contains three space-separated real numbers x, y and z (0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0). Each of x, y and z is given with exactly one digit after the decimal point.

Output

Find the maximum value of expression among xyz, xzy, (xy)z, (xz)y, yxz, yzx, (yx)z, (yz)x, zxy, zyx, (zx)y, (zy)x and print the corresponding expression. If there are many maximums, print the one that comes first in the list. 

xyz should be outputted as x^y^z (without brackets), and (xy)z should be outputted as (x^y)^z (quotes for clarity).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program uses `index` which is not defined in the provided code. This leads to a NameError when running the function `func_3`. Additionally, the logic within `func_3` is flawed. For instance, when `max(x, y, z) < 1`, it should directly call `func_1` with the appropriate values, but instead, it iterates over an undefined `index`. This indicates that the program is not fully implemented and thus does not meet the problem description requirements for every potential case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x`, `y`, `z`, and `k`. Based on the value of `k`, it calculates one of several possible power expressions involving `x`, `y`, and `z`. Specifically, it can return:

- \( x^{y^z} \) represented as a string 'x^y^z'
- \( x^{z^y} \) represented as a string 'x^z^y'
- \( x^{(y*z)} \) represented as a string '(x^y)^z'
- \( y^{x^z} \) represented as a string 'y^x^z'
- \( y^{z^x} \) represented as a string 'y^z^x'
- \( y^{(x*z)} \) represented as a string '(y^x)^z'
- \( z^{(x*y)} \) represented as a string \((z^x)^y\)

The function does not perform any additional operations or transformations beyond these power calculations. It ensures that `x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point, and `0.1 <= x, y, z <= 200.0`. If `k` does not match any of the specified cases, the function does not provide a default return value, indicating that the function is only designed to handle specific cases of `k`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `k` will always be one of the specified values (1 through 12). If `k` is outside this range, the function does not return a value, which could lead to errors in calling contexts where `k` might be undefined or incorrectly set.
- The function does not handle scenarios where `x`, `y`, or `z` are zero or negative, which could lead to mathematical errors or undefined behavior in certain power expressions.
- The function does not validate that `k` is an integer, although this is implied by the conditional checks. If a non-integer value is passed for `k`, the function may behave unexpectedly or raise an error.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `x`, `y`, `z`, and `k`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point, such that 0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0, and `k` is an integer. The function evaluates several conditional expressions based on the values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `k` and returns a tuple containing either mathematical expressions or `False` along with corresponding strings. Specifically:

- If `x > 1` and `k` is 1, the function returns `z * log(y) + log(log(x))` and 'x^y^z'.
- If `x > 1` and `k` is 2, the function returns `y * log(z) + log(log(x))` and 'x^z^y'.
- If `x > 1` and `k` is 3 or 4, the function returns `log(y) + log(z) + log(log(x))` and '(x^y)^z'.
- If `y > 1` and `k` is 5, the function returns `z * log(x) + log(log(y))` and 'y^x^z'.
- If `y > 1` and `k` is 6, the function returns `x * log(z) + log(log(y))` and 'y^z^x'.
- If `y > 1` and `k` is 7 or 8, the function returns `log(x) + log(z) + log(log(y))` and '(y^x)^z'.
- If `z > 1` and `k` is 9, the function returns `y * log(x) + log(log(z))` and 'z^x^y'.
- If `z > 1` and `k` is 10, the function returns `x * log(y) + log(log(z))` and 'z^y^x'.
- If `z > 1` and `k` is 11 or 12, the function returns `log(x) + log(y) + log(log(z))` and '(z^x)^y'.
- If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns `False` and an empty string.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts three parameters \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), each a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point and in the range 0.1 to 200.0. The function's primary task is to determine and return a specific string based on the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). Here are the steps and possible outcomes:

1. If the maximum value among \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) is less than 1, the function iterates over a list `index` and calls `func_1(x, y, z, i)` for each index. It keeps track of the maximum value (`maxNum`) and the corresponding string (`ans`). After the loop, it returns the string `ans`.
2. If the maximum value among \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) is exactly 1, the function checks the individual values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
   - If \(x\) is 1, it returns the string `'1^y^z'`.
   - If \(y\) is 1 and \(x\) is not 1, it returns the string `'1^x^z'`.
   - If neither \(x\) nor \(y\) is 1, it returns the string `'z^x^y'`.
3. In all other cases, the function iterates over the list `index` and calls `func_2(x, y, z, i)`. For each call, if the result is not `False`, it updates `maxNum` and `ans` accordingly. After the loop, it returns the string `ans`.

This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases mentioned in the postconditions.
