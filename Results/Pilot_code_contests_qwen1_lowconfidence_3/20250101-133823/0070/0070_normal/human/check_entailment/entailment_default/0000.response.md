Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_3` handles the case when the maximum value among \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) is less than 1 by using `func_1(x, y, z, i)` for each index in `index`. However, it does not handle the case when the maximum value is exactly 1 but the other values are greater than 1. 

For instance, consider the input \(x = 1.1\), \(y = 1.0\), and \(z = 1.0\). According to the problem description, the goal is to find the maximum value among the 12 possible expressions and return the corresponding expression. In this case, the maximum value would be obtained from the expression `1.1^1.0^1.0`, which is `1.1^1.0`. However, the current implementation would incorrectly return `x^y^z` instead of `(z^x)^y` as the correct answer.

Thus, the code does not correctly handle all potential cases, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
