The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `x`, `y`, `z`, and `k`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point, such that 0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0, and `k` is an integer. The function evaluates several conditional expressions based on the values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `k` and returns a tuple containing either mathematical expressions or `False` along with corresponding strings. Specifically:

- If `x > 1` and `k` is 1, the function returns `z * log(y) + log(log(x))` and 'x^y^z'.
- If `x > 1` and `k` is 2, the function returns `y * log(z) + log(log(x))` and 'x^z^y'.
- If `x > 1` and `k` is 3 or 4, the function returns `log(y) + log(z) + log(log(x))` and '(x^y)^z'.
- If `y > 1` and `k` is 5, the function returns `z * log(x) + log(log(y))` and 'y^x^z'.
- If `y > 1` and `k` is 6, the function returns `x * log(z) + log(log(y))` and 'y^z^x'.
- If `y > 1` and `k` is 7 or 8, the function returns `log(x) + log(z) + log(log(y))` and '(y^x)^z'.
- If `z > 1` and `k` is 9, the function returns `y * log(x) + log(log(z))` and 'z^x^y'.
- If `z > 1` and `k` is 10, the function returns `x * log(y) + log(log(z))` and 'z^y^x'.
- If `z > 1` and `k` is 11 or 12, the function returns `log(x) + log(y) + log(log(z))` and '(z^x)^y'.
- If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns `False` and an empty string.
