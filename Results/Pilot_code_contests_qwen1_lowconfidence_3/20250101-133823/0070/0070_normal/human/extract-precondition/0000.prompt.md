You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Wet Shark asked Rat Kwesh to generate three positive real numbers x, y and z, from 0.1 to 200.0, inclusive. Wet Krash wants to impress Wet Shark, so all generated numbers will have exactly one digit after the decimal point.

Wet Shark knows Rat Kwesh will want a lot of cheese. So he will give the Rat an opportunity to earn a lot of cheese. He will hand the three numbers x, y and z to Rat Kwesh, and Rat Kwesh will pick one of the these twelve options:

  1. a1 = xyz; 
  2. a2 = xzy; 
  3. a3 = (xy)z; 
  4. a4 = (xz)y; 
  5. a5 = yxz; 
  6. a6 = yzx; 
  7. a7 = (yx)z; 
  8. a8 = (yz)x; 
  9. a9 = zxy; 
  10. a10 = zyx; 
  11. a11 = (zx)y; 
  12. a12 = (zy)x. 



Let m be the maximum of all the ai, and c be the smallest index (from 1 to 12) such that ac = m. Rat's goal is to find that c, and he asks you to help him. Rat Kwesh wants to see how much cheese he gets, so he you will have to print the expression corresponding to that ac.

Input

The only line of the input contains three space-separated real numbers x, y and z (0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0). Each of x, y and z is given with exactly one digit after the decimal point.

Output

Find the maximum value of expression among xyz, xzy, (xy)z, (xz)y, yxz, yzx, (yx)z, (yz)x, zxy, zyx, (zx)y, (zy)x and print the corresponding expression. If there are many maximums, print the one that comes first in the list. 

xyz should be outputted as x^y^z (without brackets), and (xy)z should be outputted as (x^y)^z (quotes for clarity).

                    maxNum = t[0]
