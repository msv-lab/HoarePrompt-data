Postcondition: ***`x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0, `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0, `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0, `t` is a tuple where the first element is the maximum value between its original `maxNum` and the first element of `t`, and the second element is `ans`, `maxNum` is the maximum value between its original value and the first element of `t`, and `ans` remains the same as the second element of `t`, and `index` must contain at least two elements. If `t[0]` is not False, the first element of `t` is updated to the maximum value between its original `maxNum` and the first element of `t`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.***
