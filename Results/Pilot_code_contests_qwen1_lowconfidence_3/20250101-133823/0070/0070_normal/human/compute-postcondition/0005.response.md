`ans` is assigned the value of `t[1]`. Since `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, and `t[0]` is greater than `maxNum`, the value of `ans` will be `t[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point; `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point; `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point; the maximum value among `x`, `y`, and `z` is less than 1; `maxNum` is now equal to `t[0]`; `ans` is equal to `t[1]`; `index` is a non-empty iterable.
