The function `func_3` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`. Each of these parameters is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point and lies within the range 0.1 to 200.0, inclusive.

The function returns different strings based on the following cases:
- Case_1: Returns the string corresponding to the maximum value among `x`, `y`, and `z` if this maximum value is less than 1.
- Case_2: Returns the string `'1^y^z'` if the maximum of `x`, `y`, and `z` is 1.
- Case_3: Returns the string `'1^x^z'` if the current value of `y` is 1.
- Case_4: Returns the string `'z^x^y'` if the maximum of `x`, `y`, and `z` is not 1 and `y` is not equal to 1.
- Case_5: Returns `ans`, which is the corresponding `t[1]` for the iteration where `maxNum` was last updated.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept three real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` with one digit after the decimal point and in the range 0.1 to 200.0, and return a specific string based on the conditions described above.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x, y, and z, each a real number with one digit after the decimal point and in the range 0.1 to 200.0. It returns a string based on the maximum value among x, y, and z and certain conditions related to their values.**
