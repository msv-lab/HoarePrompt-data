The initial state is that `x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point, and they lie within the range 0.1 to 200.0, inclusive. The maximum value among `x`, `y`, and `z` is less than 1.

The code assigns `0` to `maxNum` and an empty string to `ans`.

Since the initial values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not specified, and the only changes made are assigning `0` to `maxNum` and an empty string to `ans`, the output state will reflect these changes.

Output State: **`x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point, `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point, `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point, the maximum value among `x`, `y`, and `z` is less than 1, `maxNum` is 0, `ans` is an empty string**.
