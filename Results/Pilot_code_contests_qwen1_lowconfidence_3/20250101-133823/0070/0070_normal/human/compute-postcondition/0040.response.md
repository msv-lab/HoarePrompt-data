The code `t = func_2(x, y, z, i)` calls the function `func_2` with the arguments `x`, `y`, `z`, and `i`. The function `func_2` returns a tuple with two elements. Given the precondition, the first element of the tuple is not False, which means it will be assigned to `maxNum`, and the second element will be assigned to `ans`.

The initial states are:
- `x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0,
- `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0,
- `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0,
- `maxNum` is either the value of `t[0]` if `t[0] > maxNum` or remains `None` if `t[0]` was `None`,
- `ans` is `t[1]`,
- `index` must contain at least two elements,
- `t` is the result of `func_2(x, y, z, i)` with the first element not being `False`.

After executing the code, the new states are:
- `t` is now a tuple containing the results of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`.
- `maxNum` is updated to the first element of `t` (which is not `False`).
- `ans` is set to the second element of `t`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0, `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0, `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0, `maxNum` is the first element of `t`, `ans` is the second element of `t`, `index` must contain at least two elements, and `t` is the result of `func_2(x, y, z, i)` with the first element not being `False`.**
