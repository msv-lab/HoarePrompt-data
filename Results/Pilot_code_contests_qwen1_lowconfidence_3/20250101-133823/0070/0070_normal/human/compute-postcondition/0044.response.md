Postcondition: ***`x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0, `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0, `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0, `maxNum` is the maximum value between its original value and the first element of `t`, and `ans` remains as the second element of `t`. `index` must contain at least two elements. If `t[0] != False`, `maxNum` is updated accordingly; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
