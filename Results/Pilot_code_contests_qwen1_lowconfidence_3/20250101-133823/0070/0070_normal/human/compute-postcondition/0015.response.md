The code assigns `t[1]` to `ans`. Here, `t` is a tuple containing two elements, where `t[1]` is the second element of the tuple. Since the exact values of `t` are not provided, we cannot determine the specific value of `t[1]`. However, we know that `ans` is assigned the second element of `t`.

The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point, `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point, `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point, the maximum value among `x`, `y`, and `z` is less than 1, `maxNum` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, `ans` is the second element of `t`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
