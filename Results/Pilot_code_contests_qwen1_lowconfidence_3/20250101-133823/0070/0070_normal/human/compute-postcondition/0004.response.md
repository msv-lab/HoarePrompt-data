Postcondition: ***`x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point, `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point, `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point, the maximum value among `x`, `y`, and `z` is less than 1, `maxNum` is now equal to `t[0]`, `ans` is an empty string, `index` is a non-empty iterable, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)` and `t[0]` is greater than `maxNum`***
