Postcondition: ***`x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0, `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0, `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0, `maxNum` is either the value of `t[0]` if `t[0] > maxNum` or remains None if `t[0]` was None, `ans` is `t[1]`, `index` must contain at least one element, and `t` is the result of `func_2(x, y, z, i)` with the first element not being False.***
