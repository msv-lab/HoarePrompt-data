The code initializes two variables: `maxNum` is set to `None` and `ans` is set to an empty string. The initial values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the only variables affected by the code are `maxNum` and `ans`.

Output State: **`x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0, inclusive; `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0, inclusive; `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0, inclusive; `maxNum` is `None`; `ans` is an empty string**
