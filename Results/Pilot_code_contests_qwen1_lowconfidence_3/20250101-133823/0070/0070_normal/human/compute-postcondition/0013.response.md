To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the given conditions and the loop statement.

Given:
- `x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point.
- `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point.
- `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point.
- The maximum value among `x`, `y`, and `z` is less than 1.
- `maxNum` is `t[0]` (since the condition `t[0] > maxNum` is checked and if true, `maxNum` remains unchanged).
- `ans` is either an empty string or `t[1]`.

The loop statement is:
```
for i in index:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Here, `index` is likely an iterable containing some values that control the loop's execution. To proceed to the next iteration, the loop needs to continue based on the condition inside the loop. However, since the loop body is omitted, we need to consider the typical conditions under which a `for` loop would continue iterating.

In the absence of specific loop body details, we can infer that the loop might be checking some condition related to the indices or values being iterated over. Given the information provided, we need to ensure that the loop can execute again, meaning that the `index` should be updated to the next value.

Since the problem does not provide the exact nature of `index` or how it is defined, we assume it is an integer or similar type that increments by 1 with each iteration. Thus, for the loop to continue, `i` (the current index) should be incremented by 1.

Let's summarize the states to be adjusted:

- `x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point.
- `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point.
- `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point.
- The maximum value among `x`, `y`, and `z` is less than 1.
- `maxNum` is `t[0]` (since the condition `t[0] > maxNum` is checked and if true, `maxNum` remains unchanged).
- `ans` is either an empty string or `t[1]`.
- `i` (the current index) should be incremented by 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point, `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point, `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point, the maximum value among `x`, `y`, and `z` is less than 1, `maxNum` is `t[0]`, `ans` is either an empty string or `t[1]`, and `i` is incremented by 1**.
