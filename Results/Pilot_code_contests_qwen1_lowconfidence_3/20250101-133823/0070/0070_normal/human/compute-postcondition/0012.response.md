Postcondition: ***`x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point; `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point; `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point; the maximum value among `x`, `y`, and `z` is less than 1; `maxNum` is `t[0]` (since the condition `t[0] > maxNum` is checked and if true, `maxNum` remains unchanged); `ans` is either an empty string or `t[1]`.***
