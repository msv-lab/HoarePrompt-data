Output State: **`x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0, `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0, `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0, `maxNum` is the maximum value of all `t[0]` for each iteration of the loop where `t[0]` is not False, `ans` is the corresponding `t[1]` for the iteration where `maxNum` was last updated, and `index` is the list of indices used in the loop.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in `index`.
- For each iteration, it computes `t = func_2(x, y, z, i)`.
- If `t[0]` is not `False`, it updates `maxNum` and `ans` with the current values of `t[0]` and `t[1]`, respectively.
- After all iterations, `maxNum` will hold the highest value among all valid `t[0]` (where `t[0]` is not `False`), and `ans` will be the corresponding `t[1]`.

Since the loop may or may not execute based on the contents of `index`, the final values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial values, as they are not modified within the loop.
