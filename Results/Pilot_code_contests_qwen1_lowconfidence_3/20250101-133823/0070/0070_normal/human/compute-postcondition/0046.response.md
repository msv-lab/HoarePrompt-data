The code `t = func_2(x, y, z, i)` calls a function `func_2` with parameters `x`, `y`, `z`, and `i`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the provided code snippet. Without knowing the exact implementation of `func_2`, we cannot determine the exact values of `t`, `maxNum`, `ans`, or `index` after the function call. Therefore, we can only state that the function `func_2` has been called with the given parameters.

The initial conditions remain unchanged except for the assignment of `t` to the result of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`. The variables `maxNum`, `ans`, and `index` may be updated based on the internal logic of `func_2`.

Output State: **`x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0, `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0, `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range 0.1 to 200.0, `t` is the result of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`, `maxNum` is the maximum value between its original value and the first element of `t`, `ans` remains as the second element of `t`, and `index` must contain at least two elements**.
