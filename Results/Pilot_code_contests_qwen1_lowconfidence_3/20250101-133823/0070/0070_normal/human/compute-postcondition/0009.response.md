The function `func_1` is called with arguments `x`, `y`, `z`, and `i`. However, the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided. Without knowing the exact behavior of `func_1`, we can only infer that it returns a tuple `(maxNum, ans)`. The values of `maxNum` and `ans` will be updated based on the return value of `func_1`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point
- `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point
- `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point
- The maximum value among `x`, `y`, and `z` is less than 1
- `maxNum` is set to `t[0]` and `ans` is set to `t[1]` after the if condition is met; otherwise, `maxNum` and `ans` retain their initial values (both `maxNum` is 0 and `ans` is an empty string).

Since we don't know the exact return value of `func_1`, we consider both cases where the if condition is met and where it is not.

Case 1: If condition is met (`maxNum` and `ans` are updated):
- `maxNum` is set to `t[0]`
- `ans` is set to `t[1]`

Case 2: If condition is not met (`maxNum` and `ans` retain their initial values):
- `maxNum` remains 0
- `ans` remains an empty string

Given the problem's setup and the lack of specific details about `func_1`, the most general and correct answer would be to state both possibilities:

Output State: **`x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point; `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point; `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point; the maximum value among `x`, `y`, and `z` is less than 1; `maxNum` is either 0 or `t[0]` and `ans` is either an empty string or `t[1]`.**

If we had more information about `func_1`, we could narrow down the exact values of `maxNum` and `ans`.
