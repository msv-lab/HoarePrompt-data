Postcondition: ***`x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point; `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point; `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point; the maximum value among `x`, `y`, and `z` is less than 1; `maxNum` is equal to `t[0]` and `ans` is equal to `t[1]` after the if condition is met; otherwise, `maxNum` and `ans` retain their initial values (both `maxNum` is 0 and `ans` is an empty string).***
