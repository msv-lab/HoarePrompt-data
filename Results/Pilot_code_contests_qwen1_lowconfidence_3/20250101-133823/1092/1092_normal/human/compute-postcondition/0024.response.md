`s` is incremented by 1. Initially, `s` is set to 1, so after the increment, `s` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`i`, `l`, and `j`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is a non-empty string, `l` is a non-empty list of strings, `j` is a substring of either `i` or `l` and `j` is an uppercase string, `s` is 2**
