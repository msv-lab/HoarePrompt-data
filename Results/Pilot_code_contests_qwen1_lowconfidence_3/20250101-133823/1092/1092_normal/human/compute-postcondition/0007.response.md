`s` is incremented by 1. The value of `n`, `l`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states. The output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a non-empty list of strings, `m` is 0, `s` is 1, `l` must have at least one string, and the current value of `j` is a string with at least one uppercase character**
