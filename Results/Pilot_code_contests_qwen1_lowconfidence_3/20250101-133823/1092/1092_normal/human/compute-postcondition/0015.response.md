Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a non-empty list of strings, `m` is 0, `s` is the count of uppercase characters in the concatenated string formed by all strings in `l`, `l` must be a non-empty list of strings, and the program state reflects that `s` is incremented by 1 for each uppercase character encountered in any of the strings in `l`.**
