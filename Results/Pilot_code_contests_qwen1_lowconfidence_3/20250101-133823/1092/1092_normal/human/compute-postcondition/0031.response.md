Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial States:**
   - `i` is a non-empty string.
   - `l` is a non-empty list of strings.
   - `s` is the count of uppercase characters in the string `i`.
   - `m` is equal to `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `l`, assigning each element to the variable `i` for the duration of the current iteration.

3. **Determine the Condition for Continuing the Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `l`.
   - After the last iteration, `i` will hold the value of the last string from the list `l`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop iterates through each element in `l`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be set to the next element in the list `l`.
   - `l` will be modified to exclude the element that was just processed (i.e., `i`).

5. **Formulate the New States:**
   - `i` will be the next string in the list `l`.
   - `l` will be the remaining list of strings, excluding the last processed element.
   - `s` and `m` will remain the same since they depend on the initial value of `i`, which is being reassigned for the next iteration.

Given this analysis, the states to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

- `i` will be the next string in the list `l`.
- `l` will be the remaining list of strings, excluding the last processed element.
- `s` and `m` will remain unchanged.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is the next string in the list `l`, `l` is the remaining list of strings (excluding the last processed element), `s` is the count of uppercase characters in the string `i`, `m` is equal to `s`**
