Let's break down the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\).
- `l` is a non-empty list of strings.
- `m` is `s`.
- `s` is 0.
- `i` is the next string in the list `l`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in i:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - `i` is described as "the next string in the list `l`." This implies that `i` is a single string from the list `l`.
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one string in `i`. Since `i` is a string, it is inherently a non-empty entity (a single string).

2. **List `l`:**
   - `l` is a non-empty list of strings.
   - To ensure that the loop can iterate over elements in `i`, `l` must contain at least one string. This condition is already met since `l` is specified as non-empty.

3. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop iterates over each character `j` in the string `i`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be a non-empty string to allow the loop to execute.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `n`, `m`, and `s` are not directly involved in the loop condition or execution.
   - `n` and `s` are given specific values but do not affect the loop's ability to execute based on the provided context.
   - `m` is defined as `s`, and since `s` is 0, this does not impact the loop's execution.

### Conclusion:
The key requirement for the loop to execute is that `i` must be a non-empty string (which it is, since it is derived from a non-empty list `l`). All other variables (`n`, `m`, and `s`) do not need adjustment as they do not directly influence the loop's execution.

### Final State:
**`i` is a non-empty string, l is a non-empty list of strings.**

So, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`i` is a non-empty string, l is a non-empty list of strings**
