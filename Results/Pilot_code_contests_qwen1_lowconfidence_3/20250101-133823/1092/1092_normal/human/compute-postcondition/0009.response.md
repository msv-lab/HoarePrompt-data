To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the conditions for the loop to continue.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\)
   - `l` is a non-empty list of strings
   - `m` is 0
   - `s` is either 1 or remains unchanged
   - `l` must have at least one string
   - The program state reflects that either the current value of `j` contains at least one uppercase character (in which case `s` is 1) or does not contain any uppercase character (in which case `s` remains 0)

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `j` in the list `i`.
   - We need to determine the initial state of `i` before the first iteration and how it changes for subsequent iterations.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we don't know the exact operations inside the loop. However, the loop continues as long as there are elements left in `i`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must contain at least one element.
   - The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` should remain the same unless explicitly changed within the loop body, which is not provided here.
   - The list `l` remains the same since it is not modified in the loop body either.

Given these points, we can conclude that the only state that needs to be adjusted is the list `i`. It must have at least one element to allow the loop to continue executing.

**Step-by-step adjustment:**
- At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have processed one element from `i`.
- Therefore, `i` now contains the remaining elements of the original list `i` minus one element.
- To ensure the loop can execute again, `i` must still contain at least one element.

**Final State:**
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\)
- `l` is a non-empty list of strings
- `m` is 0
- `s` is either 1 or remains unchanged
- `i` must have at least one element

**State:**
**`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `l` is a non-empty list of strings, `m` is 0, `s` is either 1 or remains unchanged, `i` must have at least one element**
