To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and analyze the loop statement.

### Given Information
- The initial state before the loop is: `s` is 0.
- The loop statement is: `for j in i:`

### Analysis
1. **Loop Syntax**: The loop syntax `for j in i:` indicates that `i` is an iterable object (like a list, tuple, string, etc.), and `j` takes on each value from `i` in sequence during each iteration of the loop.

2. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be an iterable with at least one element. If `i` is empty, the loop will not execute at all.

3. **Current State**: Currently, `s` is 0, but there is no mention of `i` in the initial state. Therefore, we need to determine what `i` is and ensure it meets the condition of being an iterable with at least one element.

### Conclusion
Since the problem does not provide specific details about `i`, we can assume that `i` could be any iterable. However, for the loop to execute, `i` must be a non-empty iterable. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is a non-empty iterable.

### Final State Adjustment
State: **`s` is 0, `i` must be a non-empty iterable**
