Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a non-empty list of strings, `m` is 0, `s` is either 1 or remains unchanged, `l` must have at least one string, and the program state reflects that either the current value of `j` contains at least one uppercase character (in which case `s` is 1) or does not contain any uppercase character (in which case `s` remains 0).***
