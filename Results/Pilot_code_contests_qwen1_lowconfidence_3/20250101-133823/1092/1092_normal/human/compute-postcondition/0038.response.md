`s` is incremented by 1. Since `s` was either 1 (if an element `j` in `i` is uppercase) or 0 (if no such element exists), incrementing it by 1 changes its value to 2 if it was initially 1, and to 1 if it was initially 0. The state of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is 2 if it was initially 1 or 1 if it was initially 0, and `i` remains a non-empty iterable.**
