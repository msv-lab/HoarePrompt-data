Functionality: **The function processes an input string consisting of single-space separated words, where each word contains small and capital Latin letters. It counts the number of uppercase characters in each word and determines the maximum count among all words. The function then prints this maximum count. The function accepts no explicit parameters but relies on user input for the integer `n` (though `n` is not used in the function) and the input string. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the maximum count of uppercase characters in any word within the input string is printed. Potential edge cases include empty strings or strings with no uppercase characters, in which case the output will be 0.**
