The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it appears to take input from other sources (such as user input or predefined values). The function processes an integer `n` such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 200`, and a string consisting of single-space separated words where each word is made up of small and capital Latin letters. 

Based on the given output cases, the function does not directly return a value but seems to process the input and might print or return a result based on certain conditions.

However, strictly following the format and the instruction to describe the parameters and return value:

The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. It processes an integer `n` such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 200`, and a string consisting of single-space separated words where each word is made up of small and capital Latin letters. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process an integer `n` within the specified range and a string of words, though no specific return value is mentioned in the provided output cases.

Functionality: **The function processes an integer `n` such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 200`, and a string consisting of single-space separated words where each word is made up of small and capital Latin letters.**
