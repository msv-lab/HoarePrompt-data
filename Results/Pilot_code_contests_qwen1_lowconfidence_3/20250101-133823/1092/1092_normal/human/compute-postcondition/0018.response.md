`s` is reassigned to 0, which overrides its previous value as the count of uppercase characters in the concatenated string formed by all strings in `l`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a non-empty list of strings, `m` is `s`, `s` is 0, `i` is the next string in the list `l`**
