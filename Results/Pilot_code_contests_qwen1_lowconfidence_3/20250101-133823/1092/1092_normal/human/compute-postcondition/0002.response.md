The code `m = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `m`. This does not affect the value of `n` or the list `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; `l` is a list of strings obtained from user input; `m` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; `l` is a list of strings obtained from user input; `m` is 0**
