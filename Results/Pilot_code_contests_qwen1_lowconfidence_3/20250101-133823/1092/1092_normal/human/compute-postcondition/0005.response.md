To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given for loop and analyze the requirements.

Given for loop:
```python
for j in i:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop syntax `for j in i:` suggests that `i` is an iterable, and `j` takes each value from `i` in sequence during each iteration of the loop. For this loop to execute, `i` (which is `l` in the context of the given states) must be a non-empty iterable.

Here are the initial states:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200
- `l` is a non-empty list of strings
- `m` is 0
- `s` is 0

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `l` (the iterable) is not empty. Additionally, since `j` will take values from `l`, we should explicitly mention the first element of `l` if needed, but the primary requirement is that `l` is non-empty.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a non-empty list of strings, `m` is 0, `s` is 0, `l` must have at least one string**

This ensures that the loop can start executing as `l` must be a non-empty iterable.
