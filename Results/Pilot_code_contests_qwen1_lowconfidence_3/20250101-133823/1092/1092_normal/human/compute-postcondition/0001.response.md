The code `l = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `l`. The variable `n` remains unchanged because `raw_input().split()` does not modify `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; `l` is a list of strings obtained from user input.**
