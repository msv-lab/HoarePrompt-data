According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. The loop will execute if `l` is a non-empty list. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200
- `l` is a list of strings obtained from user input
- `m` is 0

For the loop to execute, `l` must have at least one string in it.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a non-empty list of strings, `m` is 0**
