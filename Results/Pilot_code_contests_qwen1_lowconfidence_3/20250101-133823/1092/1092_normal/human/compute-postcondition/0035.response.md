`s` is incremented by 1, starting from its initial value of 0. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is 1, `i` is a non-empty iterable, `j` is an element of `i`, and the current value of `j` is uppercase.

Output State: **`s` is 1, `i` is a non-empty iterable, `j` is an element of `i`, and the current value of `j` is uppercase.**
