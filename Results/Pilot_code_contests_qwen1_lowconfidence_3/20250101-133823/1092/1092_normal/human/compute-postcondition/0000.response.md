The code `raw_input()` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to a variable (by default, it would be stored in `input` if no variable name is specified, but here it is not assigned to any variable). However, since no variable is assigned the result of `raw_input()`, the only effect is that a line of input is read, but none of the variables are updated with this input.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `n` being an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200**
