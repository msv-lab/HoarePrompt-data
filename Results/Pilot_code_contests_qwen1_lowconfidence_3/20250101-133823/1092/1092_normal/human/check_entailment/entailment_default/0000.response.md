Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly calculates the volume of the given text according to the problem description. The function processes an input string consisting of single-space separated words and counts the number of uppercase characters in each word. It then determines the maximum count among all words and prints this maximum count, which is the volume of the text.

The code handles various potential cases, including:
- Words with no uppercase letters (e.g., "is zero" would result in a volume of 0).
- Empty strings or strings with no words (the function will print 0 in such cases).
- Words containing both uppercase and lowercase letters (e.g., "Harbour Space University" would result in a volume of 1).

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, counting the uppercase letters in each word and determining the maximum count. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem.
