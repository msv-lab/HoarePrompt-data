Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. Since the problem description mentions that the code should be evaluated under the assumption that Python 3 is being used, the use of `raw_input()` makes the program incorrect. Additionally, while the program logic to calculate the volume of the text is correct, the use of `raw_input()` in Python 3 is not valid, leading to potential runtime errors. Therefore, the program needs to be updated to use `input()` as shown in the corrected version.
