Final: **True**

Reasoning: After reviewing the program, the original assessment's concern about using `raw_input()` instead of `input()` is now addressed. The corrected program uses `input()` as required. Additionally, the output hints align with the program's functionality, confirming that it correctly calculates the volume of the text as described in the problem statement. The program processes the input string, counts the uppercase characters in each word, and prints the maximum count. This matches the problem description and the examples provided in the output hints. Therefore, the original assessment's concern is resolved, and the program is correct.
