Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2, and should be replaced with `input()` for Python 3. Although the annotated version mentions that we assume valid input and do not handle invalid cases, the core issue remains that the program is not compatible with Python 3 without modification. Therefore, the program is not fully correct as it stands.
