Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program uses `raw_input()` instead of `input()`, which means it will not work correctly in Python 3. In Python 3, `raw_input()` has been renamed to `input()`. This will cause a runtime error when running the program. To fix this, replace `raw_input()` with `input()`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    l = input().split()
    m = 0
    for i in l:
        s = 0
        for j in i:
            if j.isupper():
                s += 1
        m = max(s, m)
    print(m)
```

With this correction, the program should work as expected for all valid inputs according to the problem description.
