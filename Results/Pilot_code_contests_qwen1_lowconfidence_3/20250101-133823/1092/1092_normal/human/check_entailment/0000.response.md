Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the input text might be empty or contain no words with capital letters, which could lead to incorrect output. However, since the problem description specifies that the input will always be valid (i.e., `1 ≤ n ≤ 200` and the text will consist of single-space separated words), this particular issue might not be immediately apparent. 

To make the program fully correct, it should be modified to use `input()` in Python 3 and ensure that the input handling is robust. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    l = input().split()
    m = 0
    for i in l:
        s = 0
        for j in i:
            if j.isupper():
                s += 1
        m = max(s, m)
    print(m)
```

This corrected version should work for all potential cases according to the problem description.
