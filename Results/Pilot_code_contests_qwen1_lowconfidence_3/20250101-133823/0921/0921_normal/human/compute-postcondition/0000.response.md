The code `sys.stdout = BytesIO()` changes the standard output to an in-memory byte stream, which means any print statements will now write to this stream instead of the console. However, no variables are directly assigned or modified by this line of code. The initial state of the variables (the list of n distinct positive integers) remains unchanged.

Output State: **The input is a list of n distinct positive integers representing the powers of men in the Roman army, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; sys.stdout is redirected to an in-memory byte stream.**
