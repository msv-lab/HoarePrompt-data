The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and reads a single line of bytes from standard input using `BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline()`. The function captures the current state of standard input, reads a line, and then resets standard output to its original state before returning the read line. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling. The function simply reads a line from standard input and returns it as a bytes object.
