Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the problem requires finding the number of triplets \(i, j, k\) such that \(i < j < k\) and \(a_i > a_j > a_k\). However, the implementation uses a data structure (order tree) and a set of operations that do not directly address the problem's requirements.

#### Issues:
1. **Data Structure and Operations**: 
   - The `order_tree` class is designed for range queries and updates but does not directly help in finding the required triplets.
   - The operations performed (`query` and `update`) do not correlate with the logic needed to count decreasing subsequences of length three.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The main loop iterates backward through the sorted indices of the array `a`, but it does not correctly compute the number of valid triplets.
   - The `tree.query(cur, 1)` and `tree.update` methods do not reflect the logic required to count the triplets as specified in the problem.

3. **Algorithm Mismatch**:
   - The approach taken in the provided code does not align with the problem's requirement to count the number of decreasing subsequences of length three.
   - A more appropriate algorithm would involve using a combination of dynamic programming or segment trees to efficiently count such triplets.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, one can use a combination of dynamic programming or segment trees. Hereâ€™s a brief outline of a correct approach:
- Use a dynamic programming array to keep track of the count of valid subsequences ending at each index.
- Maintain a segment tree to efficiently update and query the counts of valid subsequences.

Given the complexity and the mismatch in the provided solution, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
