The function `func_11` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is expected to be an integer formed by concatenating the values of `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2`, `x_3`, `y_3`, `x_4`, `y_4`, `x_5`, and `y_5`. The function converts this integer `n` into its string representation, then iterates over each character in this string, converting it back into an integer, and finally returns a list of these integers. This process effectively separates the concatenated integer `n` into its individual digits. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code, but the function assumes that `n` is a valid integer formed by the specified concatenation.
