The provided code snippet is a comment and does not perform any operations that would affect the variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x_1` is an integer, `y_1` is an integer, `x_2` is an integer, `y_2` is an integer, `x_3` is an integer, `y_3` is an integer, `x_4` is an integer, `y_4` is an integer, `x_5` is an integer, `y_5` is an integer, `x_6` is an integer, `y_6` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `x_1` < `x_2` ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ `y_1` < `y_2` ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ `x_3` < `x_4` ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ `y_3` < `y_4` ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ `x_5` < `x_6` ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ `y_5` < `y_6` ≤ 10^6.**
