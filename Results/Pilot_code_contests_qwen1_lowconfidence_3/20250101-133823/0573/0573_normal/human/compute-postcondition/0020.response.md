The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` will write the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to the `file`. Since `kwargs` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume that `kwargs` is empty or does not contain a key 'end'. Therefore, `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` will return the default value `\n`.

The `file.write()` method will write this newline character `\n` to the file.

Variables that are not affected by this code remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty iterable, `at_start` is False, `sep` has the same value, the file contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by a newline character `\n`.**
