The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x_1` is an integer, `y_1` is an integer, `x_2` is an integer, `y_2` is an integer, `x_3` is an integer, `y_3` is an integer, `x_4` is an integer, `y_4` is an integer, `x_5` is an integer, `y_5` is an integer, `x_6` is an integer, `y_6` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `x_1` < `x_2` ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ `y_1` < `y_2` ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ `x_3` < `x_4` ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ `y_3` < `y_4` ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ `x_5` < `x_6` ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ `y_5` < `y_6` ≤ 10^6; `sep` is either the value associated with `'sep'` in `kwargs` or ' '; `file` is either the value associated with `'file'` in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `True`.

Output State: **`x_1` is an integer, `y_1` is an integer, `x_2` is an integer, `y_2` is an integer, `x_3` is an integer, `y_3` is an integer, `x_4` is an integer, `y_4` is an integer, `x_5` is an integer, `y_5` is an integer, `x_6` is an integer, `y_6` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `x_1` < `x_2` ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ `y_1` < `y_2` ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ `x_3` < `x_4` ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ `y_3` < `y_4` ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ `x_5` < `x_6` ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ `y_5` < `y_6` ≤ 10^6; `sep` is either the value associated with `'sep'` in `kwargs` or ' '; `file` is either the value associated with `'file'` in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `True`.**
