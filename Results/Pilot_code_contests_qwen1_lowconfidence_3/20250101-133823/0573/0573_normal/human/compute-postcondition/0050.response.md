Postcondition: ***`x3` is `max(max(y3, y1), x1)`, `y3` is `max(y3, y1)`, `x4` is the minimum of its original value and `x2`, `y4` is unchanged, `x5` is the maximum of its original value and `x1`, `y5` is `max(y5, y1)`, `x6` is the minimum of `x6` and `x2`, `y6` is `min(y6, y2)`, `one` is `False`, `two` is `True`. If the condition `(two and one)` is `False`, the sum of `a1` and `a2` is less than `area` if it is less than `area`, otherwise it is greater than or equal to `area`. If the condition `(two and one)` is `True`, and `a2 < area`, all variables retain their current values. If the condition `(two and one)` is `True` and `a2 >= area`, `a2` is updated to be greater than or equal to `area`. If `one == False` and `two == True`, either `func_16()` or `func_17()` is called based on the value of `a1` compared to `area`.***
