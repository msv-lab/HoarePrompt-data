Postcondition: ***`args` is a non-empty iterable, `at_start` is False, `sep` has the same value, the file contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by a newline character `\n`, and the file buffer is flushed regardless of whether the `flush` parameter is set to `True` or `False` (since the `flush` parameter is popped with a default value of `False`).***
