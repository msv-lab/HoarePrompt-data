According to the provided for loop statement, the loop iterates over each element in `args`. To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the following:

1. **The variable `x` (used in the loop) should be defined for each iteration**: This means that `args` must contain at least one element.
2. **The variable `x`**: During each iteration, `x` takes the value from `args`, but there's no initial value for `x` mentioned. However, we need to ensure that `args` contains elements that can be iterated over.

Given the constraints provided:
- `x_1` to `x_6` are integers with specific ranges.
- `y_1` to `y_6` are integers with specific ranges.
- `sep` is either a value associated with `'sep'` in `kwargs` or `' '`.
- `file` is either a value associated with `'file'` in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`.
- `at_start` is `True`.

The only state that directly affects the execution of the loop is `args`, which must be a non-empty iterable containing at least one element.

State: **`args` must be a non-empty iterable**, `x_1` is an integer, `y_1` is an integer, `x_2` is an integer, `y_2` is an integer, `x_3` is an integer, `y_3` is an integer, `x_4` is an integer, `y_4` is an integer, `x_5` is an integer, `y_5` is an integer, `x_6` is an integer, `y_6` is an integer, `sep` is either the value associated with `'sep'` in `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is either the value associated with `'file'` in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`.
