The code `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` does the following:

1. It pops the value associated with the key `'sep'` from the dictionary `kwargs` and assigns it to the variable `sep`. If the key `'sep'` is not present in `kwargs`, the default value `' '` (a single space) is assigned to `sep`.
2. It pops the value associated with the key `'file'` from the dictionary `kwargs` and assigns it to the variable `file`. If the key `'file'` is not present in `kwargs`, the default value `sys.stdout` is assigned to `file`.

Since `kwargs` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its contents, and thus, the exact values of `sep` and `file` are not known. However, the initial conditions for `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2`, `x_3`, `y_3`, `x_4`, `y_4`, `x_5`, `y_5`, `x_6`, and `y_6` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x_1` is an integer, `y_1` is an integer, `x_2` is an integer, `y_2` is an integer, `x_3` is an integer, `y_3` is an integer, `x_4` is an integer, `y_4` is an integer, `x_5` is an integer, `y_5` is an integer, `x_6` is an integer, `y_6` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `x_1` < `x_2` ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ `y_1` < `y_2` ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ `x_3` < `x_4` ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ `y_3` < `y_4` ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ `x_5` < `x_6` ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ `y_5` < `y_6` ≤ 10^6; `sep` is either the value associated with `'sep'` in `kwargs` or ' '; `file` is either the value associated with `'file'` in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`.**
