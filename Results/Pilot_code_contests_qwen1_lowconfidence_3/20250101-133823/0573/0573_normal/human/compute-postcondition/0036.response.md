The function `func_16()` is called, but the function definition or its contents are not provided. Without knowing what `func_16()` does, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables. However, we can list the variables and their current states based on the precondition.

Initial States:
- `x3` is `max(max(y3, y1), x1)`
- `y3` is `max(y3, y1)`
- `x4` is the minimum of its original value and `x2`
- `y4` is unchanged
- `x5` is the maximum of its original value and `x1`
- `y5` is `max(y5, y1)`
- `x6` is the minimum of `x6` and `x2`
- `y6` is `min(y6, y2)`
- `one` is `True`
- `two` is `True`
- `a2` is `abs((max(x1, x5) - min(x6, x2)) * (max(y5, y1) - min(y6, y2)))`
- `a2` is lower than `area`

Since we don't know the effect of `func_16()`, we cannot provide a specific output state. We can only confirm that the function has been called and that no other operations directly related to the variables have been performed in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`func_16()` has been called, and the states of all variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.**
