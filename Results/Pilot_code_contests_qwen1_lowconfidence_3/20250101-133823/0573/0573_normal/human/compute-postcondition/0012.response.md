`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. Since `at_start` is `False`, the current state of the file contains the string representation of the next element in `args` followed by the value of `sep`. Writing `str(x)` to the file will append `str(x)` to the file content.

The value of `args` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it. The value of `at_start` remains `False` because the condition `not at_start` was already true before the code execution, and the code does not change this state. The value of `sep` remains unchanged as well.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty iterable, `at_start` is False, `sep` has the same value, and the file now contains the string representation of the next element in `args`, the value of `sep`, and then the string representation of `x`.**
