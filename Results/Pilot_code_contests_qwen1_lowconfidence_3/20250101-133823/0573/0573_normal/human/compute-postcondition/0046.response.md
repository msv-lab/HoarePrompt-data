The function `func_17()` is called, but the content of this function is not provided in the initial state or the code snippet. Without knowing what `func_17()` does, we cannot determine how the variables will be updated. Therefore, we can only state that the function is called, and the values of the variables that are not affected by the function call remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x3` is `max(max(y3, y1), x1)`, `y3` is `max(y3, y1)`, `x4` is the minimum of its original value and `x2`, `y4` is unchanged, `a1` is `abs(max(max(y3, y1), x1) - min(x4, x2)) * abs(max(y3, y1) - y4)`, `x5` is the maximum of its original value and `x1`, `y5` is `max(y5, y1)`, `x6` is the minimum of `x6` and `x2`, `y6` is `min(y6, y2)`, `one` is `False`, `two` is `True`, `func_17()` is called.**
