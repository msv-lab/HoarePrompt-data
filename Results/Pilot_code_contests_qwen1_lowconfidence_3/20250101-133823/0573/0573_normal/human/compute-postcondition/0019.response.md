Output State: **`args` is a non-empty iterable, `at_start` is False, `sep` has the same value, and the file contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`.** 

### Explanation:
- **`args`**: This is an iterable containing all the arguments that were passed into the loop. After the loop finishes executing, `args` remains unchanged because the loop only processes its elements.
- **`at_start`**: Initially set to `True`, this flag is immediately set to `False` during the first iteration of the loop and remains `False` thereafter.
- **`sep`**: The separator used between elements in the output string. Its value remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **File Content**: The file writes the string representation of each element in `args` separated by `sep`. Since `at_start` is `False` from the second iteration onwards, `sep` is written between consecutive elements. The loop ensures that all elements in `args` are written to the file in order, separated by `sep`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `args` is an empty iterable), then:
- `at_start` remains `True`.
- The file content remains empty (`file.write(sep)` does not execute if `args` is empty, and no other elements are written).

However, based on the problem statement and the typical usage of such a loop, we assume `args` is always a non-empty iterable, making the above output state valid.
