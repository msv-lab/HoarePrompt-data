Postcondition: ***`x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`, `x5`, `y5`, `x6`, `y6`, `one`, and `two` are as follows: `x3` is `max(max(y3, y1), x1)`, `y3` is `max(y3, y1)`, `x4` is the minimum of its original value and `x2`, `y4` remains unchanged, `x5` is the maximum of its original value and `x1`, `y5` is `max(y5, y1)`, `x6` is the minimum of `x6` and `x2`, `y6` is `min(y6, y2)`, `one` is `False`, `two` is `True`. Either `func_16()` or `func_17()` is called based on the value of `a1` compared to `area`, and all other variables retain their current values regardless of the outcome of the if condition.***
