The function `func_16()` is called, but no specific details about what this function does are provided in the given code snippet. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables. However, we know that the function call itself does not directly assign new values to the variables listed in the initial state. 

Given the initial state, we can summarize the variables as follows:

- `x3` is `max(max(y3, y1), x1)`
- `y3` is `max(y3, y1)`
- `x4` is the minimum of its original value and `x2`
- `y4` is unchanged
- `x5` is the maximum of its original value and `x1`
- `y5` is `max(y5, y1)`
- `x6` is the minimum of `x6` and `x2`
- `y6` is `min(y6, y2)`
- `one` is `False`
- `two` is `True`
- The condition `(two and one)` is `False`
- `area` is `abs(x1 - x2) * abs(y1 - y2)`
- `a1` is `abs(x3 - x4) * abs(y3 - y4)`
- `a2` is `abs(x5 - x6) * abs(y5 - y6)`
- `a1 + a2` is less than `area`

Since `func_16()` does not directly modify these variables, the values remain unchanged after the function call.

Output State: **`x3` is `max(max(y3, y1), x1)`, `y3` is `max(y3, y1)`, `x4` is the minimum of its original value and `x2`, `y4` is unchanged, `x5` is the maximum of its original value and `x1`, `y5` is `max(y5, y1)`, `x6` is the minimum of `x6` and `x2`, `y6` is `min(y6, y2)`, `one` is `False`, `two` is `True`, the condition `(two and one)` is `False`, `area` is `abs(x1 - x2) * abs(y1 - y2)`, `a1` is `abs(x3 - x4) * abs(y3 - y4)`, `a2` is `abs(x5 - x6) * abs(y5 - y6)`, and `a1 + a2` is less than `area`.**
