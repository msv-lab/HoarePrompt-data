The function `func_17()` is called, but no changes are made to the variables within the provided initial state. The function does not modify the values of `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`, `x5`, `y5`, `x6`, `y6`, `one`, `two`, `a2`, or `area`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`x3` is `max(max(y3, y1), x1)`, `y3` is `max(y3, y1)`, `x4` is the minimum of its original value and `x2`, `y4` is unchanged, `x5` is the maximum of its original value and `x1`, `y5` is `max(y5, y1)`, `x6` is the minimum of `x6` and `x2`, `y6` is `min(y6, y2)`, `one` is `True`, `two` is `True`, `a2` is `abs((max(x1, x5) - min(x6, x2)) * (max(y5, y1) - min(y6, y2)))`, and `a2` is greater than or equal to `area`.**
