The function `func_17()` is called, but the details of what this function does are not provided. Since no specific changes to the variables are described in the function call itself, the values of the variables before and after the function call should remain the same unless explicitly modified within `func_17()`. Given the initial conditions and the lack of modification within the function call, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x3` is `max(max(y3, y1), x1)`, `y3` is `max(y3, y1)`, `x4` is the minimum of its original value and `x2`, `y4` is unchanged, `x5` is the maximum of its original value and `x1`, `y5` is `max(y5, y1)`, `x6` is the minimum of `x6` and `x2`, `y6` is `min(y6, y2)`, `one` is `False`, `two` is `True`, the condition `(two and one)` is `False`, `area` is `abs(x1 - x2) * abs(y1 - y2)`, `a1` is `abs(x3 - x4) * abs(y3 - y4)`, `a2` is `abs(x5 - x6) * abs(y5 - y6)`, and the sum of `a1` and `a2` is greater than or equal to `area`**.
