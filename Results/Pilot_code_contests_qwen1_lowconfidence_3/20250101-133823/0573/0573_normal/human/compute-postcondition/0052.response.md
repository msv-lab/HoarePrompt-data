The function `func_18` accepts the following parameters:

- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`: These are integers representing the coordinates of the bottom left and top right corners of the white sheet, where \(0 \leq x1 < x2 \leq 10^6\) and \(0 \leq y1 < y2 \leq 10^6\).
- `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`: These are integers representing the coordinates of the bottom left and top right corners of the first black sheet, where \(0 \leq x3 < x4 \leq 10^6\) and \(0 \leq y3 < y4 \leq 10^6\).
- `x5`, `y5`, `x6`, `y6`: These are integers representing the coordinates of the bottom left and top right corners of the second black sheet, where \(0 \leq x5 < x6 \leq 10^6\) and \(0 \leq y5 < y6 \leq 10^6\).

Based on the coordinates provided, the function determines whether the white sheet overlaps with either of the two black sheets. The possible return values and their corresponding conditions are:

Case_1: The white sheet does not overlap with any of the black sheets. In this case, the function returns `False`.
Case_2: The white sheet overlaps with at least one of the black sheets. In this case, the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_18` is to accept four pairs of coordinates for the white and two pairs of coordinates for the black sheets and return `True` if the white sheet overlaps with at least one of the black sheets, otherwise it returns `False`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` for the white sheet, and `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` and `x5`, `y5`, `x6`, `y6` for the first and second black sheets respectively. It returns `True` if the white sheet overlaps with at least one of the black sheets, otherwise it returns `False`.**
