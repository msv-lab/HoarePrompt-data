The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. This operation does not affect the values of `args`, `at_start`, or `x`. The state of `sep` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty iterable that must have at least two elements, `at_start` is False, `sep` has the same value, and the file now contains the string representation of the next element in `args`, the value of `sep`, and then the string representation of `x`, followed by the string representation of `sep`.**
