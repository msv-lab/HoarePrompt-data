Postcondition: ***`args` is a non-empty iterable that must have at least two elements, `at_start` is False, `sep` has the same value, and the file now contains the string representation of the next element in `args`, the value of `sep`, and then the string representation of `x`, followed by the string representation of `sep`.*** 

Explanation: Since there is no else part in the if-else block, the postcondition remains the same as the if part. The condition `not at_start` does not change the fact that the file now contains the string representation of the next element in `args`, the value of `sep`, and then the string representation of `x`, followed by the string representation of `sep`.
