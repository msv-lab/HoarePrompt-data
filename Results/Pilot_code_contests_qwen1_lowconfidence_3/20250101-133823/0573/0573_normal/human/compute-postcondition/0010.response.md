`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. The value of `sep` is not specified in the initial state, so it will write whatever the current value of `sep` is. The `at_start` variable remains unchanged, and the contents of the `args` iterable do not change.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty iterable, `at_start` is False, and the file contains the string representation of the next element in `args` followed by the value of `sep`.**
