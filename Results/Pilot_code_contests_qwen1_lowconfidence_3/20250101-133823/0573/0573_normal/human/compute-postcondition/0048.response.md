Postcondition: ***`x3` is `max(max(y3, y1), x1)`, `y3` is `max(y3, y1)`, `x4` is the minimum of its original value and `x2`, `y4` is unchanged, `a1` is `abs(max(max(y3, y1), x1) - min(x4, x2)) * abs(max(y3, y1) - y4)`, `x5` is the maximum of its original value and `x1`, `y5` is `max(y5, y1)`, `x6` is the minimum of `x6` and `x2`, `y6` is `min(y6, y2)`, `one` is `False`, `two` is `True`. If `two and one` remains false and `a1 < area`, `func_16()` is called. Otherwise, `func_17()` is called.***
