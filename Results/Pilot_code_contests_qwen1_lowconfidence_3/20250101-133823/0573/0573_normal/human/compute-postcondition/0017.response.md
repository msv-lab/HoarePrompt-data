The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` into the file. This operation does not change the values of `args`, `at_start`, `sep`, or `x`. However, it does modify the content of the file by appending the string representation of `x` followed by `sep`.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty iterable that must have at least two elements, `at_start` is False, `sep` has the same value, the file now contains the string representation of the next element in `args`, the value of `sep`, and then the string representation of `x`, followed by the value of `sep`.**
