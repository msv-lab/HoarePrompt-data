Functionality: **The function `func_18` accepts parameters `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` for the white sheet and `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` and `x5`, `y5`, `x6`, `y6` for the first and second black sheets respectively. It checks whether the white sheet overlaps with either of the black sheets. The function updates the coordinates of the black sheets to ensure they do not extend beyond the boundaries of the white sheet, except for the condition where the white sheet is completely within one of the black sheets. If the white sheet does not overlap with either black sheet, the function calls `func_16` and exits. If the white sheet overlaps with both black sheets, it calculates the areas of the overlapping regions and compares them to the area of the white sheet. Depending on the result, it calls either `func_16` or `func_17`. If the white sheet overlaps with only one black sheet, it performs similar calculations and calls `func_16` or `func_17` accordingly. The function returns `True` if the white sheet overlaps with at least one black sheet, otherwise it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the white sheet is completely contained within one of the black sheets, and the function will still update the black sheet coordinates accordingly before making the final decision.**

**The function also handles the case where the white sheet is completely within one of the black sheets, which is an important edge case not explicitly covered in the annotations. This ensures that the function behaves correctly even when the white sheet is fully enclosed by a black sheet.**

**If the function encounters invalid input (e.g., coordinates that do not satisfy the given constraints), it should handle these cases appropriately, such as by calling `func_16` and exiting.**
