The function `func_14` accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` under specific conditions and `False` otherwise. Specifically, it returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, less than or equal to 3 and not 3, divisible by 2, or divisible by 3. If `n` is not divisible by 2, 3, and passes the primality check (i.e., no divisors from 5 up to the square root of `n` and no divisors of the form `i` and `i+2`), it returns `True`.
