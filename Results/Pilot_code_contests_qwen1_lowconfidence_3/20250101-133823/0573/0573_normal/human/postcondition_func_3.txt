The function `func_4` accepts no parameters and returns a list. This list is generated by calling `func_3()`, but since `func_3()` is not defined, the elements of the returned list are undefined. There are no preconditions or postconditions explicitly stated other than the return type being a list. Potential edge cases include the possibility that `func_3()` might raise an exception or return an empty list, although these are not specified in the given information.
