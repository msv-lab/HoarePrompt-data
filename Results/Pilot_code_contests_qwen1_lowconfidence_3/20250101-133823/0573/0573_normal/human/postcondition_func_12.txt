The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After executing the algorithm, the function returns `x`, which is the GCD, and sets `y` to 0. The function handles the edge case where either `x` or `y` is 0 by correctly terminating the loop and returning the non-zero value. If both `x` and `y` are 0, the function still terminates and returns 0 for `x` and 0 for `y`.
