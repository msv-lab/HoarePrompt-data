The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `l`, which is a list of tuples or lists, each containing four integers representing the coordinates of the bottom left and top right corners of a rectangle (x1, y1, x2, y2). The function sorts this list based on a key determined by the `getKey` function and returns the sorted list. The sorted list maintains the same structure as the input, with each element still being a tuple or list of four integers representing the coordinates of the rectangles. The function handles the case where the input list `l` is empty, returning an empty list in such scenarios. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that require special handling beyond the sorting operation.
