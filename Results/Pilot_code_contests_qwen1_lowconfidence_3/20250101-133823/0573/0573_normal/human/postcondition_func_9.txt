The function `func_10` accepts an integer `n` and returns its binary string representation without the '0b' prefix. The function achieves this by using the built-in `bin()` function to convert the integer to a binary string, which includes the '0b' prefix, and then removes this prefix using the `replace('0b', '')` method. This function correctly handles all non-negative integer inputs, including zero and very large integers within the specified range (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 - 1). There are no missing functionalities or edge cases noted in the provided code.
