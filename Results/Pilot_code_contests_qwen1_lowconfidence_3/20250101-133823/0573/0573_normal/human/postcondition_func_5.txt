The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `item`, which must be a non-empty list or tuple. The function returns the first element of `item`, which can be of any type. There are no additional actions or transformations performed on the elements of `item`. If `item` is an empty list or tuple, the function will raise an `IndexError` since there is no first element to return.
