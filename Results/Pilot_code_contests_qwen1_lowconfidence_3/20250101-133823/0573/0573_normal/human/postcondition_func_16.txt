The function `func_17` calls another function `func_19` with the argument 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function call, the program state remains unchanged with respect to the input variables `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2`, `x_3`, `y_3`, `x_5`, `y_5`, `x_6`, and `y_6`. The only action performed is the invocation of `func_19` with the string 'NO' as its argument.
