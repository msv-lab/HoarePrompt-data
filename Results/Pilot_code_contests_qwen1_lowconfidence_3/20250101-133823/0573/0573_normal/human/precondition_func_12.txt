x, y are non-negative integers representing coordinates or dimensions of the sheets such that 0 ≤ x < 10^6 and 0 ≤ y < 10^6. However, based on the problem description, x and y in this function are not related to the sheets' coordinates but seem to be part of a different utility function that might be used elsewhere in the program to determine the greatest common divisor (GCD).
