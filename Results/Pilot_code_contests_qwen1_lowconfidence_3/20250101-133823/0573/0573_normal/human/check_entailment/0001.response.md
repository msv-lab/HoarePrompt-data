Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the white sheet is completely covered by the black sheets. Specifically, in the first example, the white sheet is fully covered by the black sheets, but the program incorrectly prints "NO" instead of "YES".

Let's break down the issue:

1. **First Example Analysis**:
   - White sheet: (2, 2) to (4, 4)
   - First black sheet: (1, 1) to (3, 5)
   - Second black sheet: (3, 1) to (5, 5)

   In this case, the white sheet is fully covered by the black sheets. The program should print "YES" because there is no part of the white sheet that can be seen from above. However, the program prints "NO", which is incorrect.

2. **Relevant Code Segment**:
   ```python
   if not one and (not two):
       func_16()  # Prints 'NO'
       exit()
   ```

   Here, `one` and `two` are both set to `False` when the white sheet is fully covered by the black sheets. This results in the program printing "NO" instead of checking for any overlap that might allow part of the white sheet to be visible.

To fix this, the program needs to check if there is any part of the white sheet that is not covered by either black sheet. The current logic only checks if the entire white sheet is covered, but it should also check for partial coverage.

A corrected version would involve checking if the white sheet intersects with the area outside both black sheets. Here is a simplified version of how this could be done:

```python
def func_18():
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = func_3()
    (x3, y3, x4, y4) = func_3()
    (x5, y5, x6, y6) = func_3()

    # Check if white sheet is fully covered by black sheets
    if (x3 <= x1 and x4 >= x2 and y3 <= y1 and y4 >= y2) or \
       (x5 <= x1 and x6 >= x2 and y5 <= y1 and y6 >= y2):
        func_17()  # Print 'NO'
    else:
        func_16()  # Print 'YES'
```

With this correction, the program would correctly handle the case where the white sheet is partially covered by the black sheets.
