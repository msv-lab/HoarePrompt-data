Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The code provided in `func_18` attempts to determine if any part of the white sheet can be seen after placing two black sheets on the table. However, the logic in `func_18` has several issues that do not fully align with the problem description:

1. **Coordinate Adjustments**: The code adjusts the coordinates of the black sheets to ensure they do not extend beyond the boundaries of the white sheet. This adjustment is unnecessary and incorrect according to the problem description. The problem statement does not require the black sheets to be adjusted in such a way. Instead, it asks whether any part of the white sheet can be seen from above after the black sheets are placed, which means checking if there is any point on the white sheet that is not covered by the black sheets.

2. **Overlap Calculation**: The code calculates the areas of the overlapping regions between the white sheet and the black sheets, but it does not correctly determine if any part of the white sheet is visible. Specifically, the code updates the coordinates of the black sheets to avoid extending beyond the white sheet boundaries, which changes the original problem's intent. The goal is to check if there is any un-covered part of the white sheet, not to adjust the black sheets' positions.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases where the black sheets completely cover the white sheet or where the white sheet is partially covered. The code assumes that if the white sheet overlaps with both black sheets, it should calculate the areas and decide based on the results, but this is not always accurate. For example, if the black sheets completely cover the white sheet, the code should return "NO", but the current implementation might incorrectly return "YES" due to the adjustments made.

To illustrate, consider the following example:
- White sheet: (1, 1) to (5, 5)
- Black sheet 1: (2, 2) to (4, 4)
- Black sheet 2: (3, 3) to (5, 5)

In this case, the white sheet is completely covered by the black sheets, but the current code might incorrectly determine that there is an uncovered part due to the adjustments made.

Given these issues, the code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
