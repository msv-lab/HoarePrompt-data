Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads and parses the input for the coordinates of the white sheet and the two black sheets. It uses `func_3()` to read the coordinates of the sheets, which ensures that the input is parsed into a list of integers.

2. **Coordinate Adjustments**: The program adjusts the coordinates of the black sheets to ensure they do not overlap with the boundaries of the white sheet. Specifically, it ensures:
   - The bottom-left and top-right coordinates of the black sheets are within the bounds of the white sheet.
   - The adjusted coordinates are calculated to avoid invalid intersections.

3. **Visibility Check**: The program checks if there is any part of the white sheet visible by ensuring that the intersection areas of the black sheets with the white sheet do not cover the entire white sheet. This is done through the following steps:
   - Calculate the area of the white sheet (`area`).
   - Calculate the areas of the two black sheets (`a1` and `a2`).
   - Check if the sum of the areas of the two black sheets is less than the area of the white sheet. If so, some part of the white sheet is visible.

4. **Output**: Based on the visibility check, the program prints "YES" if some part of the white sheet is visible and "NO" otherwise.

### Detailed Steps:
- **Input Reading**: 
  ```python
  x1, y1, x2, y2 = func_3()
  x3, y3, x4, y4 = func_3()
  x5, y5, x6, y6 = func_3()
  ```
  This correctly reads and parses the coordinates of the white sheet and the two black sheets.

- **Adjustment of Coordinates**:
  ```python
  y4 = min(y4, y2)
  y3 = max(y3, y1)
  y6 = min(y6, y2)
  y5 = max(y5, y1)
  x4 = min(x4, x2)
  x3 = max(x3, x1)
  x6 = min(x6, x2)
  x5 = max(x5, x1)
  ```
  These adjustments ensure that the black sheets are within the bounds of the white sheet.

- **Visibility Check**:
  ```python
  area = abs(x1 - x2) * abs(y1 - y2)
  a1 = abs(x3 - x4) * abs(y3 - y4)
  a2 = abs(x5 - x6) * abs(y5 - y6)
  if a1 + a2 < area:
      func_16()  # Print "YES"
  else:
      func_17()  # Print "NO"
  ```
  This section correctly calculates the areas and checks if the sum of the areas of the black sheets is less than the area of the white sheet, determining whether any part of the white sheet is visible.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description by reading the necessary input, adjusting the coordinates of the black sheets, and checking the visibility of the white sheet. Therefore, the program is correct, and the output is always as expected based on the problem statement.
