Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the white sheet is completely contained within one of the black sheets. In such a scenario, the program incorrectly determines that no part of the white sheet can be seen, even though there might still be a part of the white sheet visible outside the updated coordinates of the black sheet.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

- White sheet: (1, 1) to (4, 4)
- First black sheet: (0, 0) to (3, 5)
- Second black sheet: (5, 0) to (7, 3)

In this case, the white sheet is completely within the first black sheet. However, after updating the coordinates of the black sheet to avoid extending beyond the white sheet, the white sheet still has a part visible. The program incorrectly concludes that no part of the white sheet can be seen.

The relevant section of the code is:

```python
if not one and (not two):
    func_16()
    exit()
```

This block incorrectly exits the program if both `one` and `two` are `False`, even if the white sheet is partially visible due to the updated coordinates of the black sheets.

To fix this, the program needs to properly check if the white sheet overlaps with either black sheet, even if the black sheets have been updated to avoid extending beyond the white sheet.
