Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if some part of the white sheet can be seen after placing the two black sheets. Specifically, the program checks if the white sheet is completely covered by the black sheets, but it does not check for overlaps or partial coverage. The output hints indicate that `func_19` handles printing output but do not address the core logic issue. Therefore, the program fails to correctly determine visibility, leading to incorrect results for many cases as demonstrated in the examples provided.
