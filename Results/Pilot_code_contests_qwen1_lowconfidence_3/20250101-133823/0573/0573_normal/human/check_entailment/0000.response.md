Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if some part of the white sheet can be seen after placing the two black sheets. Specifically, the program checks if the white sheet is completely covered by the black sheets, but it does not check if there is any overlap or partial coverage that would still allow some part of the white sheet to be visible.

Let's analyze a potential case where the program fails:

Consider the following inputs:
- White sheet: (2, 2, 4, 4)
- First black sheet: (1, 1, 3, 5)
- Second black sheet: (3, 1, 5, 5)

According to the problem description, the white sheet should be partially visible because there is an overlap between the white sheet and the black sheets, but not completely covered. However, the program incorrectly determines that the white sheet is fully covered by the black sheets.

To fix this, the program needs to check for overlaps and calculate areas to determine if any part of the white sheet is still visible. The current implementation does not perform these necessary calculations, leading to incorrect results for certain cases.
