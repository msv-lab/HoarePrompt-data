You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a white sheet of paper lying on a rectangle table. The sheet is a rectangle with its sides parallel to the sides of the table. If you will take a look from above and assume that the bottom left corner of the table has coordinates (0, 0), and coordinate axes are left and bottom sides of the table, then the bottom left corner of the white sheet has coordinates (x_1, y_1), and the top right — (x_2, y_2).

After that two black sheets of paper are placed on the table. Sides of both black sheets are also parallel to the sides of the table. Coordinates of the bottom left corner of the first black sheet are (x_3, y_3), and the top right — (x_4, y_4). Coordinates of the bottom left corner of the second black sheet are (x_5, y_5), and the top right — (x_6, y_6). 

<image> Example of three rectangles.

Determine if some part of the white sheet can be seen from the above after the two black sheets are placed. The part of the white sheet can be seen if there is at least one point lying not strictly inside the white sheet and strictly outside of both black sheets.

Input

The first line of the input contains four integers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (0 ≤ x_1 < x_2 ≤ 10^{6}, 0 ≤ y_1 < y_2 ≤ 10^{6}) — coordinates of the bottom left and the top right corners of the white sheet.

The second line of the input contains four integers x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 (0 ≤ x_3 < x_4 ≤ 10^{6}, 0 ≤ y_3 < y_4 ≤ 10^{6}) — coordinates of the bottom left and the top right corners of the first black sheet.

The third line of the input contains four integers x_5, y_5, x_6, y_6 (0 ≤ x_5 < x_6 ≤ 10^{6}, 0 ≤ y_5 < y_6 ≤ 10^{6}) — coordinates of the bottom left and the top right corners of the second black sheet.

The sides of each sheet of paper are parallel (perpendicular) to the coordinate axes.

Output

If some part of the white sheet can be seen from the above after the two black sheets are placed, print "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise print "NO".

Note

In the first example the white sheet is fully covered by black sheets.

In the second example the part of the white sheet can be seen after two black sheets are placed. For example, the point (6.5, 4.5) lies not strictly inside the white sheet and lies strictly outside of both black sheets.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if some part of the white sheet can be seen after placing the two black sheets. Specifically, the program checks if the white sheet is completely covered by the black sheets, but it does not check if there is any overlap or partial coverage that would still allow some part of the white sheet to be visible.

Let's analyze a potential case where the program fails:

Consider the following inputs:
- White sheet: (2, 2, 4, 4)
- First black sheet: (1, 1, 3, 5)
- Second black sheet: (3, 1, 5, 5)

According to the problem description, the white sheet should be partially visible because there is an overlap between the white sheet and the black sheets, but not completely covered. However, the program incorrectly determines that the white sheet is fully covered by the black sheets.

To fix this, the program needs to check for overlaps and calculate areas to determine if any part of the white sheet is still visible. The current implementation does not perform these necessary calculations, leading to incorrect results for certain cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4, x_5, y_5, x_6, y_6 are integers such that 0 <= x_1 < x_2 <= 10^6, 0 <= y_1 < y_2 <= 10^6, 0 <= x_3 < x_4 <= 10^6, 0 <= y_3 < y_4 <= 10^6, 0 <= x_5 < x_6 <= 10^6, 0 <= y_5 < y_6 <= 10^6.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1()` prompts the user to input an integer. After receiving the input, it converts the input to an integer type and returns it. The function does not perform any validation on the input, meaning it will accept any input from the user and convert it to an integer regardless of whether it is a valid integer within the expected range or not. Therefore, if the user inputs something that cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., a string), the function will raise a `ValueError`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the program has returned an integer value provided by the user.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4, x_5, y_5, x_6, y_6 are integers such that 0 ≤ x_1 < x_2 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_1 < y_2 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ x_3 < x_4 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_3 < y_4 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ x_5 < x_6 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_5 < y_6 ≤ 10^6.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns input() which is waiting for user input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and waits for user input. It returns the user's input as a string. There are no edge cases or missing functionality in the provided code since the only action is to return the result of the `input()` function. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has received user input and returned it.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4, x_5, y_5, x_6, y_6 are integers such that 0 ≤ x_1 < x_2 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_1 < y_2 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ x_3 < x_4 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_3 < y_4 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ x_5 < x_6 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_5 < y_6 ≤ 10^6.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object containing integer values from user input, where the input is a space-separated string of six pairs of integers (x, y) each satisfying 0 ≤ x < y ≤ 10^6
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` reads a single line of user input, expecting a space-separated string of six pairs of integers (x, y) where 0 ≤ x < y ≤ 10^6. It then converts these pairs into a map object containing integer values. If the input does not match the expected format, the behavior is undefined because the function does not include any error handling. The function returns this map object. Potential edge cases include invalid inputs or malformed strings that do not conform to the expected format.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4, x_5, y_5, x_6, y_6 are integers such that 0 ≤ x_1 < x_2 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_1 < y_2 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ x_3 < x_4 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_3 < y_4 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ x_5 < x_6 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_5 < y_6 ≤ 10^6.
def func_4():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list generated by func_3() with undefined elements since the definition of func_3() is not provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts no parameters and returns a list. This list is generated by calling `func_3()`, but since `func_3()` is not defined, the elements of the returned list are undefined. There are no preconditions or postconditions explicitly stated other than the return type being a list. Potential edge cases include the possibility that `func_3()` might raise an exception or return an empty list, although these are not specified in the given information.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4, x_5, y_5, x_6, y_6 are integers such that 0 ≤ x_1 < x_2 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_1 < y_2 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ x_3 < x_4 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_3 < y_4 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ x_5 < x_6 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_5 < y_6 ≤ 10^6. Additionally, the function `func_5` sets the recursion limit and stack size for a thread, indicating that the main function it calls might involve a large number of recursive calls or deep recursion. However, this precondition does not directly relate to the geometric constraints of the sheets' positions.
def func_5():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
    threading.stack_size(40960000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` sets the recursion limit and stack size for a new thread, then starts the thread to execute the `main` function. The function accepts no parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the program will have started a new thread with a recursion limit of 100,000,000 and a stack size of 40,960,000 bytes, executing the `main` function in that thread. There are no postconditions explicitly provided, but the thread will continue to run independently of the original thread until it completes.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: item is a list or tuple containing at least one element where the first element is of any type.
def func_6(item):
    return item[0]
    #The program returns the first element of the list or tuple 'item', which is of any type but guaranteed to exist
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `item`, which must be a non-empty list or tuple. The function returns the first element of `item`, which can be of any type. There are no additional actions or transformations performed on the elements of `item`. If `item` is an empty list or tuple, the function will raise an `IndexError` since there is no first element to return.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of tuples or lists, where each tuple or list contains exactly four integers representing the coordinates of the bottom left and top right corners of a rectangle (x1, y1, x2, y2) such that 0 ≤ x1 < x2 ≤ 10^6 and 0 ≤ y1 < y2 ≤ 10^6.
def func_7(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey)
    #The program returns a list of tuples or lists sorted based on the key returned by getKey function, where each tuple or list contains exactly four integers representing the coordinates of the bottom left and top right corners of a rectangle (x1, y1, x2, y2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `l`, which is a list of tuples or lists, each containing four integers representing the coordinates of the bottom left and top right corners of a rectangle (x1, y1, x2, y2). The function sorts this list based on a key determined by the `getKey` function and returns the sorted list. The sorted list maintains the same structure as the input, with each element still being a tuple or list of four integers representing the coordinates of the rectangles. The function handles the case where the input list `l` is empty, returning an empty list in such scenarios. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that require special handling beyond the sorting operation.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers representing the height and width of the resulting 2D list, respectively, and num is an integer or any other type of value that will fill the 2D list.
def func_8(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #A 2D list of dimensions n by m filled with the value num
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. `n` and `m` are non-negative integers representing the height and width of the resulting 2D list, respectively, and `num` is an integer or any other type of value that will fill the 2D list. After execution, the function returns a 2D list of dimensions `n` by `m` where every element is set to the value `num`. This means that each row of the 2D list contains exactly `m` elements, all of which are equal to `num`, and there are exactly `n` such rows. The function handles the case where either `n` or `m` is zero by returning an empty 2D list (i.e., a list containing no rows). There are no missing functionalities in the provided code.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the width of the white sheet (x2 - x1) or the width of the black sheets (x4 - x3 or x6 - x5).
def func_9(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns True if x is 1, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts an integer `x` and returns `True` if `x` is exactly 1, otherwise it returns `False`. There are no additional actions performed by the function beyond the logical check provided by the expression `return x and not x & x - 1`. This expression evaluates to `True` only when `x` is 1, and `False` otherwise. There are no edge cases or missing functionality within the given code snippet.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4, x_5, y_5, x_6, y_6 are integers such that 0 ≤ x_1 < x_2 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_1 < y_2 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ x_3 < x_4 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_3 < y_4 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ x_5 < x_6 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_5 < y_6 ≤ 10^6.
def func_10(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns a binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts an integer `n` and returns its binary string representation without the '0b' prefix. The function achieves this by using the built-in `bin()` function to convert the integer to a binary string, which includes the '0b' prefix, and then removes this prefix using the `replace('0b', '')` method. This function correctly handles all non-negative integer inputs, including zero and very large integers within the specified range (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 - 1). There are no missing functionalities or edge cases noted in the provided code.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4, x_5, y_5, x_6, y_6 are integers such that 0 ≤ x_1 < x_2 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_1 < y_2 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ x_3 < x_4 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_3 < y_4 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ x_5 < x_6 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_5 < y_6 ≤ 10^6.
def func_11(n):

    #The program returns a list of integers derived from the string representation of `n`, where `n` is the integer formed by concatenating the values of `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2`, `x_3`, `y_3`, `x_4`, `y_4`, `x_5`, and `y_5` in order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is expected to be an integer formed by concatenating the values of `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2`, `x_3`, `y_3`, `x_4`, `y_4`, `x_5`, and `y_5`. The function converts this integer `n` into its string representation, then iterates over each character in this string, converting it back into an integer, and finally returns a list of these integers. This process effectively separates the concatenated integer `n` into its individual digits. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code, but the function assumes that `n` is a valid integer formed by the specified concatenation.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, and p are integers such that 0 <= x < p, y >= 0, and p > 0.
def func_12(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the result of the repeated squaring operation, `y` is 0, `p` is an integer such that \(p > 0\), `res` is the result of multiplying `x` by itself an appropriate number of times based on the binary representation of the original `y`, all taken modulo \(p\).
    return res
    #The program returns res, which is the result of multiplying x by itself an appropriate number of times based on the binary representation of the original y, all taken modulo p
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `p` where \(0 \leq x < p\) and \(p > 0\), and \(y \geq 0\). It calculates \(x^y \mod p\) using the method of exponentiation by squaring. Specifically, it iterates through the binary representation of `y`, squaring `x` repeatedly and multiplying by `x` only when the corresponding bit in `y` is set. After the loop, it returns the result stored in `res`. 

This function handles the case where `y` is zero, in which case it directly returns `1` since \(x^0 = 1\). There are no explicit checks for `x` being equal to `0` or `p` being a specific value, so these edge cases are implicitly handled by the modular arithmetic operations.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y are non-negative integers representing coordinates or dimensions of the sheets such that 0 ≤ x < 10^6 and 0 ≤ y < 10^6. However, based on the problem description, x and y in this function are not related to the sheets' coordinates but seem to be part of a different utility function that might be used elsewhere in the program to determine the greatest common divisor (GCD).

    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`; `y` is 0.
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y, and y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After executing the algorithm, the function returns `x`, which is the GCD, and sets `y` to 0. The function handles the edge case where either `x` or `y` is 0 by correctly terminating the loop and returning the non-zero value. If both `x` and `y` are 0, the function still terminates and returns 0 for `x` and 0 for `y`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` under specific conditions and `False` otherwise. Specifically, it returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, less than or equal to 3 and not 3, divisible by 2, or divisible by 3. If `n` is not divisible by 2, 3, and passes the primality check (i.e., no divisors from 5 up to the square root of `n` and no divisors of the form `i` and `i+2`), it returns `True`.

def func_16():
    func_19('YES')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` calls another function `func_19` with the argument 'YES'. After calling `func_19`, the function does not return any value and there are no further operations performed within `func_16`. Therefore, the state of the program after `func_16` concludes is that `func_19` has been called with 'YES' as its argument.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_18` accepts parameters `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` for the white sheet and `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` and `x5`, `y5`, `x6`, `y6` for the first and second black sheets respectively. It checks whether the white sheet overlaps with either of the black sheets. The function updates the coordinates of the black sheets to ensure they do not extend beyond the boundaries of the white sheet, except for the condition where the white sheet is completely within one of the black sheets. If the white sheet does not overlap with either black sheet, the function calls `func_16` and exits. If the white sheet overlaps with both black sheets, it calculates the areas of the overlapping regions and compares them to the area of the white sheet. Depending on the result, it calls either `func_16` or `func_17`. If the white sheet overlaps with only one black sheet, it performs similar calculations and calls `func_16` or `func_17` accordingly. The function returns `True` if the white sheet overlaps with at least one black sheet, otherwise it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the white sheet is completely contained within one of the black sheets, and the function will still update the black sheet coordinates accordingly before making the final decision.

If `args` is empty, the function will only write the `end` character to the output stream.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
