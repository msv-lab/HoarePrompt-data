Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code in `func_18` does not correctly determine if any part of the white sheet can be seen from above after placing the two black sheets. The main issue is in how it checks for overlap between the white sheet and the black sheets. Specifically, the code does not properly account for the case where the white sheet is completely covered by one of the black sheets.

Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Overlap Check**: The code attempts to check if the white sheet is completely covered by one of the black sheets using the following conditions:
   ```python
   if x5 > x2 or y6 < y1 or x6 < x1 or (y5 > y2):
       one = False
   if y3 > y2 or y4 < y1 or x3 > x2 or (x4 < x1):
       two = False
   ```
   These conditions are not sufficient to determine if the white sheet is completely covered by one of the black sheets. They only check if the white sheet's boundaries are outside the black sheet's boundaries, which is insufficient.

2. **Area Calculation**: The code calculates the areas of the white sheet and the black sheets to determine if there is any overlap:
   ```python
   area = abs(x1 - x2) * abs(y1 - y2)
   a1 = abs(x3 - x4) * abs(y3 - y4)
   a2 = abs(x5 - x6) * abs(y5 - y6)
   ```
   It then compares these areas to decide if the white sheet is visible. However, this approach does not correctly handle the case where the white sheet is completely covered by one of the black sheets.

3. **Edge Case**: Consider the following scenario:
   - White sheet: `(0, 0) to (10, 10)`
   - First black sheet: `(0, 0) to (10, 15)`
   - Second black sheet: `(0, 15) to (10, 20)`
   
   In this case, the white sheet is completely covered by the first black sheet, but the code incorrectly determines that the white sheet is visible because it does not account for the full coverage scenario.

To fix this, the code needs to properly handle the case where the white sheet is completely covered by one of the black sheets. One possible solution is to check if the white sheet's boundaries are entirely within the black sheet's boundaries. Here is an updated version of the relevant part of `func_18`:

```python
def func_18():
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = func_3()
    (x3, y3, x4, y4) = func_3()
    (x5, y5, x6, y6) = func_3()
    
    # Check if white sheet is completely covered by one of the black sheets
    if (x1 >= x3 and x2 <= x4 and y1 >= y3 and y2 <= y4) or \
       (x1 >= x5 and x2 <= x6 and y1 >= y5 and y2 <= y6):
        func_17()
        return
    
    # Update coordinates of black sheets
    y4 = min(y4, y2)
    y3 = max(y3, y1)
    y6 = min(y6, y2)
    y5 = max(y5, y1)
    x4 = min(x4, x2)
    x3 = max(x3, x1)
    x6 = min(x6, x2)
    x5 = max(x5, x1)
    
    # Calculate areas
    area = abs(x1 - x2) * abs(y1 - y2)
    a1 = abs(x3 - x4) * abs(y3 - y4)
    a2 = abs(x5 - x6) * abs(y5 - y6)
    
    # Determine visibility
    if a1 + a2 < area:
        func_16()
    else:
        func_17()
```

This updated version correctly handles the case where the white sheet is completely covered by one of the black sheets.
