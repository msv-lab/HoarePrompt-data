The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. `n` and `m` are non-negative integers representing the height and width of the resulting 2D list, respectively, and `num` is an integer or any other type of value that will fill the 2D list. After execution, the function returns a 2D list of dimensions `n` by `m` where every element is set to the value `num`. This means that each row of the 2D list contains exactly `m` elements, all of which are equal to `num`, and there are exactly `n` such rows. The function handles the case where either `n` or `m` is zero by returning an empty 2D list (i.e., a list containing no rows). There are no missing functionalities in the provided code.
