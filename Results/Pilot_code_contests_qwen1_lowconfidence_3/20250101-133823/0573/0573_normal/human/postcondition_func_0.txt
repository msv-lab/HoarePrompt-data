The function `func_1()` prompts the user to input an integer. After receiving the input, it converts the input to an integer type and returns it. The function does not perform any validation on the input, meaning it will accept any input from the user and convert it to an integer regardless of whether it is a valid integer within the expected range or not. Therefore, if the user inputs something that cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., a string), the function will raise a `ValueError`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the program has returned an integer value provided by the user.
