This function changes the file streams for standard input and output to redirect them to 'input.txt' and 'output.txt' files, respectively. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function executes, all input will be read from 'input.txt' and all output will be written to 'output.txt'. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotation that need to be handled separately, and the code does not contain any missing functionality regarding redirection.
