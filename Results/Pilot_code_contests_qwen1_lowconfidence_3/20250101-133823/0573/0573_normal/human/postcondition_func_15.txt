The function `func_16` calls another function `func_19` with the argument 'YES'. After calling `func_19`, the function does not return any value and there are no further operations performed within `func_16`. Therefore, the state of the program after `func_16` concludes is that `func_19` has been called with 'YES' as its argument. There are no changes to the input variables (`x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2`, `x_3`, `y_3`, `x_4`, `y_4`, `x_5`, `y_5`, `x_6`, `y_6`). This means the function does not process or use these coordinates in any way.
