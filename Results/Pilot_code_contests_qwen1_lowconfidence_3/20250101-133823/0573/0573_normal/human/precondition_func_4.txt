**x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4, x_5, y_5, x_6, y_6 are integers such that 0 ≤ x_1 < x_2 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_1 < y_2 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ x_3 < x_4 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_3 < y_4 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ x_5 < x_6 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_5 < y_6 ≤ 10^6. Additionally, the function `func_5` sets the recursion limit and stack size for a thread, indicating that the main function it calls might involve a large number of recursive calls or deep recursion. However, this precondition does not directly relate to the geometric constraints of the sheets' positions.
