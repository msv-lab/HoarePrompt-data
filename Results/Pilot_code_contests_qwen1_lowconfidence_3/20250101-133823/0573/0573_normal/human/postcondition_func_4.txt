The function `func_5` sets the recursion limit and stack size for a new thread, then starts the thread to execute the `main` function. The function accepts no parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the program will have started a new thread with a recursion limit of 100,000,000 and a stack size of 40,960,000 bytes, executing the `main` function in that thread. There are no postconditions explicitly provided, but the thread will continue to run independently of the original thread until it completes.
