The function `func_3()` reads a single line of user input, expecting a space-separated string of six pairs of integers (x, y) where 0 ≤ x < y ≤ 10^6. It then converts these pairs into a map object containing integer values. If the input does not match the expected format, the behavior is undefined because the function does not include any error handling. The function returns this map object. Potential edge cases include invalid inputs or malformed strings that do not conform to the expected format.
