The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. This operation does not affect the value of `x` or `args`, nor does it change the state of `at_start` or `sep`. The precondition that `args` has at least one element and if `at_start` is `False`, then a value of `sep` has been written to the file, remains unchanged.

Output State: **`args` has at least one element, if `at_start` is `False`, then a value of `sep` has been written to the file, `x` is its original value**
