`curr` is assigned the value 1. The value of `curr` was previously `1 + a[6] + (c[5] - b[6] + 1)`, but now it is simply 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 5, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `t` is 0, `curr` is 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `best` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `curr + c[i]`, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `a` is a list of integers from the user input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the user input.**
