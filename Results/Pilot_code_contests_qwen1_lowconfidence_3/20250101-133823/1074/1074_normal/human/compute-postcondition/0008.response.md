`at_start` is assigned the value `False`. The value of `args` remains unchanged, and since `sep` and `x` are not referenced or modified in the code, their states remain the same as before. Therefore, the Output State is: `args` has at least one element, if `at_start` is `False`, then a value of `sep` has been written to the file, `x` is its original value, `at_start` is `False`.
Output State: **`args` has at least one element, `at_start` is `False`**
