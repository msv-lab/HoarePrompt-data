According to the code, the loop will execute if the variable `t` (the number of iterations) is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `i` is equal to `n`
- `curr` is either 1 or adjusted based on the final values of `a[n-1]` and `b[n-1]`
- `n` is a positive integer
- `best` is the maximum value obtained during the iterations of the loop
- `func_2(best)` has been called

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. `t` must be greater than 0.
2. Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `i = n + 1`.
3. The variable `t` should be decremented by 1, making it `t = t - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `t` is `t - 1`

Since `curr`, `n`, and `best` do not change based on the loop's execution condition, they remain the same.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, `curr` is either 1 or adjusted based on the final values of `a[n-1]` and `b[n-1]`, `n` is a positive integer, `best` is the maximum value obtained during the iterations of the loop**
