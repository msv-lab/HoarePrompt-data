The code snippet updates the value of `curr` by adding `a[i + 1] + (c[i] - b[i + 1] + 1)` to its current value. The variable `best` is not directly involved in this line of code, so its value remains unchanged from the initial state. The updated value of `curr` depends on the values of `a[i + 1]`, `c[i]`, and `b[i + 1]`.

Given the initial state where `best` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `curr + c[i]`, the output state will reflect the updated value of `curr`:

Output State: **`best` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `curr + c[i]`; `curr` is updated to `curr + a[i + 1] + (c[i] - b[i + 1] + 1)`**
