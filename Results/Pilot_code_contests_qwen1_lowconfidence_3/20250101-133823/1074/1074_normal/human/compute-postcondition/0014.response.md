According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. For the loop to execute again, `args` must have at least two elements. At the end of the last iteration, `args` has at least two elements, and `at_start` is `False`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still have at least two elements. The value of `at_start` does not affect the loop's continuation since the condition only checks the length of `args`.

State: **`args` has at least two elements, and `at_start` is False**
