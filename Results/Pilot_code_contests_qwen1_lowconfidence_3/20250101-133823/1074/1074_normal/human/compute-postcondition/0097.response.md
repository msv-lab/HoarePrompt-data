`curr` is incremented by `a[i + 1] + (c[i] - b[i + 1] + 1)`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so `i + 1` is 4. Thus, `curr` is updated to its current value plus `a[4] + (c[3] - b[4] + 1)`.

- `a[4]` is the minimum of the original `a[4]` and `b[4]`.
- `b[4]` is the maximum of the original `a[4]` and `b[4]`.

The value of `curr` is updated accordingly, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `t` is 1, `best` is `max(best, curr + c[3])`, `a[3]` is the minimum of the original `a[3]` and `b[3]`, `b[3]` is the maximum of the original `a[3]` and `b[3]`, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `curr` is updated to its current value plus `a[4] + (c[3] - b[4] + 1)`**.
