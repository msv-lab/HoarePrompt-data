Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `t` is 1, `best` is `max(1, b[1] - a[1] + 1 + c[1])`, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and if `a[i + 1]` equals `b[i + 1]`, `a[i]` remains unchanged.***
