Output State: **`args` is a list containing at least two elements, `at_start` is `False`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization and Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts with `at_start` being `True`.
   - For each iteration, if `at_start` is `False`, `sep` is written to `file`.
   - `str(x)` is then written to `file`.
   - `at_start` is set to `False`.

2. **First Iteration:**
   - `at_start` is initially `True`, so the loop body doesn't write anything to `file` on the first pass.
   - On the second iteration, `at_start` becomes `False`, and `sep` is written to `file`.
   - Then `str(x)` is written, making `at_start` `False` again.
   
3. **Subsequent Iterations:**
   - Each subsequent iteration continues to write `sep` and `str(x)` to `file` without resetting `at_start` to `True` because it remains `False` from the second iteration onwards.

4. **Final State After All Iterations:**
   - `at_start` will remain `False` after all iterations since it is only set to `False` within the loop and never reset to `True` after the first pass where `sep` is written.
   - `args` must contain at least two elements for the loop to execute at least twice, ensuring that both `sep` and `str(x)` are written to `file` during the second and subsequent iterations.

Therefore, the final output state is that `args` contains at least two elements, and `at_start` is `False`.
