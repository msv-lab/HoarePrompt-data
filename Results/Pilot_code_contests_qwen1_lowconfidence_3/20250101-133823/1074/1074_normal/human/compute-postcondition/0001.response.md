The code `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` does the following:
- It removes the 'sep' key from the `kwargs` dictionary and assigns its value (if present) to `sep`. If 'sep' is not in `kwargs`, `sep` is set to a space `' '`.
- It removes the 'file' key from the `kwargs` dictionary and assigns its value (if present) to `file`. If 'file' is not in `kwargs`, `file` is set to `sys.stdout`.

Since the initial state does not provide any specific values for `kwargs`, `sep`, or `file`, and the code only modifies these based on `kwargs`, the specific values of `t`, `n`, `c_i`, `a_i`, and `b_i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, c_i is an integer such that 2 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, a_i is an integer such that a_1 = -1 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ c_{i-1}, and b_i is an integer such that b_1 = -1 and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ c_{i-1}; sep is a space if 'sep' is not in kwargs, otherwise the value of 'sep' in kwargs; file is sys.stdout if 'file' is not in kwargs, otherwise the value of 'file' in kwargs.**
