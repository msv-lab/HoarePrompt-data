To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: An integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `c_i`: An integer such that \(2 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\).
- `a_i`: An integer such that \(a_1 = -1\) and \(1 \leq a_i \leq c_{i-1}\).
- `b_i`: An integer such that \(b_1 = -1\) and \(1 \leq b_i \leq c_{i-1}\).
- `sep`: A space if `'sep'` is not in `kwargs`, otherwise the value of `'sep'` in `kwargs`.
- `file`: `sys.stdout` if `'file'` is not in `kwargs`, otherwise the value of `'file'` in `kwargs`.
- `at_start`: `True`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for x in args:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `args` list.
2. **Variables Involved**: The loop involves the variable `x` which will take each element from `args` one by one.

### Required Adjustments:
- To ensure the loop can execute, `args` must contain at least one element.
- The initial state of other variables (`t`, `n`, `c_i`, `a_i`, `b_i`, `sep`, `file`, `at_start`) does not directly affect the loop's ability to execute unless they are used within the loop body (which is not provided here).

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is the presence of elements in the `args` list.

### Final Answer:
State: **`args` must have at least one element**.
