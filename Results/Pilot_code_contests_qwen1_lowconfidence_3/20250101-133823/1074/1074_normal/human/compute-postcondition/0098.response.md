The code snippet sets `curr` to 1. Since `curr` was previously updated to its current value plus `a[4] + (c[3] - b[4] + 1)`, the new value of `curr` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `t` is 1, `best` is `max(best, curr + c[3])`, `a[3]` is the minimum of the original `a[3]` and `b[3]`, `b[3]` is the maximum of the original `a[3]` and `b[3]`, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `curr` is 1**
