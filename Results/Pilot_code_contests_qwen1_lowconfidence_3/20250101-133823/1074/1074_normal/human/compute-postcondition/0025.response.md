Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It takes a list of arguments (`args`), a separator (`sep`), a file object (`file`), and optional keyword arguments (`kwargs`). The function writes each element of `args` to the specified file, separated by `sep`, and ends with the value of `kwargs['end']`. If `kwargs['flush']` is `True`, it flushes the file buffer. The final state of the program is that the elements of `args` have been written to the file with the specified separator and end character, and the file buffer (if open) has been flushed if requested. Potential edge cases include when `args` is empty or when `kwargs` do not contain certain keys. If `args` is empty, no output will be generated. If `kwargs` does not contain `sep`, `end`, or `flush`, their default values (' ', '\n', and `False`, respectively) will be used.**

The annotation suggests the function accepts parameters through `kwargs` but the actual code only uses `sep` and `file` from `kwargs` and does not utilize any other keyword arguments. Therefore, the functionality should only consider these used parameters.
