The code snippet `c = [int(ci) for ci in input().split()]` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts each integer to an integer type, storing them in a list `c`. The variables `t`, `curr`, `best`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. The value of `n` remains the same as it was before, but now `c` is updated with the new list of integers.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `t` is 1, `curr` is the final value of `curr` after all iterations, `best` is the maximum value attained by `curr + c[i]` during the loop, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the input integer.**
