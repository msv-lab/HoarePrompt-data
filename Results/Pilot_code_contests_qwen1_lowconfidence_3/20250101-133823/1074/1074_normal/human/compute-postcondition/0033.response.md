Postcondition: ***`i` is 3; `curr` is 1; `n` is greater than 3; `best` is `max(B, b[2] - a[2] + 1 + a[3] + c[2] - b[3] + 1 + a[4] + c[3] - b[4] + 1 + c[3])` if `a[3]` does not equal `b[3]`; `best` is `max(B, 1 + a[4] + c[3] - b[4] + 1 + c[3])` if `a[3]` equals `b[3]`.***

Explanation:
- The if condition checks if `a[i + 1]` (which is `a[4]`) is equal to `b[i + 1]` (which is `b[4]`).
- If the condition is true (`a[4] == b[4]`), then:
  - `curr` remains as 1.
  - No change to `n`.
  - `best` remains as `max(B, 1 + a[4] + c[3] - b[4] + 1 + c[3])`.
- Since there is no else part, the postcondition of the if part directly becomes the overall postcondition.
