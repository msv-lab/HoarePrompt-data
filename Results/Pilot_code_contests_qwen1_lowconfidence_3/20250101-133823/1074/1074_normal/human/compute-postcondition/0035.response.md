Output State: **`i` is `n`, `curr` is either 1 or adjusted based on the final values of `a[n-1]` and `b[n-1]`, `n` is a positive integer, `best` is the maximum value obtained during the iterations of the loop.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - Initially, `i` starts from 1.
   - `curr` is set to `b[1] - a[1] + 1`.
   - `best` is initialized to 1.
   - `a[i]` and `b[i]` are defined such that `a[i]` is the minimum and `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
   - For each iteration, `best` is updated as `max(best, curr + c[i])`.
   - `curr` is updated as `curr += a[i + 1] + (c[i] - b[i + 1] + 1)` unless `a[i + 1]` equals `b[i + 1]`, in which case `curr` resets to 1.

3. **Final Iteration**:
   - When the loop reaches `i = n-1`, `i` becomes `n`.
   - At this point, `curr` is either 1 (if `a[n-1]` equals `b[n-1]`) or adjusted based on the value of `a[n-1]` and `b[n-1]`.
   - `best` contains the maximum value obtained during all iterations.

4. **Non-Execution Case**:
   - If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 1), then `i` remains 1, `curr` is `b[1] - a[1] + 1`, and `best` remains 1.

Thus, after the loop completes, the final state of the variables is as described above.
