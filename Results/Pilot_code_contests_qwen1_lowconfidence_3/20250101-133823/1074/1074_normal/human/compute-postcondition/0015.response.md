`file.write(sep)` writes the content of `sep` to the file. However, the value of `sep` itself is not provided in the initial state or the code snippet, and `args` and `at_start` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`args` has at least two elements, and `at_start` is False**
