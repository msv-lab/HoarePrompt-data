The code snippet updates `a[i]` and `b[i]` such that `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This operation does not affect the values of `a[i+1]`, `b[i+1]`, `a[i+2]`, `b[i+2]`, `i`, `n`, `t`.

- `a[i+2]` remains the minimum of the original `a[i+2]` and `b[i+2]`.
- `b[i+2]` remains the maximum of the original `a[i+2]` and `b[i+2]`.
- `i` remains `i + 2` and must be less than `n`.
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `a[i+1]` remains the minimum of the original `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`.
- `b[i+1]` remains the maximum of the original `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`a[i+2]` is the minimum of the original `a[i+2]` and `b[i+2]`, `b[i+2]` is the maximum of the original `a[i+2]` and `b[i+2]`, `i` is `i + 2` and must be less than `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `a[i+1]` is the minimum of the original `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, `b[i+1]` is the maximum of the original `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`**.
