Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `total` is 10, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `t` is 0, `curr` is `b[1] - a[1] + a[3] + c[2] - b[3] + 2`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `best` is the maximum value between 1 and `curr + c[i]` for each iteration of the loop, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input. Additionally, in this state, `a[i + 1]` is equal to `b[i + 1]`.**
