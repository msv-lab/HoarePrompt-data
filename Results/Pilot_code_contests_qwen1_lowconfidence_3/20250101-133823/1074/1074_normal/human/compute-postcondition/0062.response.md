The code sets `curr` to 1. This updates the value of `curr`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `t` is 0, `curr` is 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `best` is the maximum value between 1 and `curr + c[0]`, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
