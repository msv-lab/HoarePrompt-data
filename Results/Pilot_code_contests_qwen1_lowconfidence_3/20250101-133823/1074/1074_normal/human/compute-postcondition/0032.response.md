The code sets `curr` to 1. This changes the value of `curr` from its previous state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3; `curr` is 1; `n` is greater than 3; `best` is `max(B, b[2] - a[2] + 1 + a[3] + c[2] - b[3] + 1 + a[4] + c[3] - b[4] + 1 + c[3])` if `a[3]` does not equal `b[3]`; `best` is `max(B, 1 + a[4] + c[3] - b[4] + 1 + c[3])` if `a[3]` equals `b[3]`.**
