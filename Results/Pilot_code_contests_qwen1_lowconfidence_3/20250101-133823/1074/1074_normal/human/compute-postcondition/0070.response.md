Postcondition: ***`total` is 10, `i` is 5, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `t` is 0, `curr` is either 1 (if `a[6] == b[6]` holds true) or remains 1 (if `a[6] != b[6]`), `n` is an integer input from the user, `best` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `curr + c[i]`, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `a` is a list of integers from the user input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the user input. If `a[i + 1] == b[i + 1]`, `curr` is reset to 1 and `best` is updated accordingly; otherwise, the values of `curr` and `best` remain unchanged.***
