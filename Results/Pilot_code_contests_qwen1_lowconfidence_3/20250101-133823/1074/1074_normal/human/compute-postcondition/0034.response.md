Postcondition: ***`i` is 3; `curr` is either `b[2] - a[2] + 1 + a[3] + c[2] - b[3] + 1` (if `a[3]` does not equal `b[3]`) or 1 (if `a[3]` equals `b[3]`); `n` is greater than 3; `best` is `max(B, b[2] - a[2] + 1 + a[3] + c[2] - b[3] + 1 + c[3])` if `a[3]` does not equal `b[3]`; `best` is `max(B, 1 + c[3])` if `a[3]` equals `b[3]`.***

Explanation: Since the `else` part is not provided, we consider only the `if` part. According to the `if` part, the value of `i` remains 3, `curr` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, and `best` is updated to `max(B, 1 + c[3])` if `a[3]` equals `b[3]`. There are no additional conditions or changes from the `else` part to consider, so the overall postcondition reflects the changes made within the `if` part alone.
