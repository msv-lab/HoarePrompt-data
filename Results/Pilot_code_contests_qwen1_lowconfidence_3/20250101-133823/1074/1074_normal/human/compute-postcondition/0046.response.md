Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `a[i+1]` is now the minimum of the original `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`.
   - `b[i+1]` is now the maximum of the original `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`.
   - `i` is `i + 1` and must be less than `n`.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `a[i]` is now the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
   - `b[i]` is now the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Current State Analysis:**
   - `i` is currently `i + 1` from the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - If `i` is already equal to `n`, the loop will terminate.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - Check if `i` is still less than `n`.

6. **New State for Next Iteration:**
   - If `i` was `i + 1` previously, it becomes `i + 2` in the next iteration.
   - Ensure `i + 2` is less than `n`.

7. **Other States Remain Unchanged:**
   - `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]` are updated based on their respective values.
   - `t` remains greater than 0.
   - `a[i]` and `b[i]` are updated based on their respective values.

Therefore, the new state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a[i+2]` is now the minimum of the original `a[i+2]` and `b[i+2]`, `b[i+2]` is now the maximum of the original `a[i+2]` and `b[i+2]`, `i` is `i + 2` and must be less than `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `a[i+1]` is now the minimum of the original `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, `b[i+1]` is now the maximum of the original `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`**
