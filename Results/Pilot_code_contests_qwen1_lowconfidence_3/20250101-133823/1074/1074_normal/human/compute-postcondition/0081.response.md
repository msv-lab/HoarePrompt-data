The code updates the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` such that `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Given the initial conditions, `a[i]` and `b[i]` are initially set to `a[1]` and `b[1]`, respectively.

- `a[1]` is the minimum of the original `a[1]` and `b[1]`.
- `b[1]` is the maximum of the original `a[1]` and `b[1]`.

Therefore, when the code runs:
- `a[i]` will be updated to `a[1]`.
- `b[i]` will be updated to `b[1]`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `t` is 1, `curr` is the value of `curr` from the previous iteration, `best` is the value of `best` from the previous iteration, `a[i]` is `a[1]`, `b[i]` is `b[1]`, `c` is the same list of integers**
