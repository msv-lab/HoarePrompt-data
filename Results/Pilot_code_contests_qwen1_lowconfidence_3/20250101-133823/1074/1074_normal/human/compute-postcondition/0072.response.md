The function `func_2(best)` is called with `best` as an argument. This function call does not modify any variables; it only uses `best` as an argument. Therefore, the values of all the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `t` is `0`, `curr` is the final value of `curr` after all iterations (which could be `1` or a more complex value depending on the operations inside the loop), `best` is the maximum value attained by `curr + c[i]` during the loop, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
