Postcondition: ***`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `t` is 0, `curr` is either 1 (if `a[i + 1] == b[i + 1]` holds true) or remains 1 (if `a[i + 1] != b[i + 1]`), `n` is an integer input from the user, `best` is the maximum value between 1 and `curr + c[0]`, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.***
