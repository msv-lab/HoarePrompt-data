The function `func_2(best)` is called, but the function itself is not defined in the provided code snippet. Since the function does not modify any global variables and its implementation is not given, the values of the variables outside of `func_2` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the input integer, `t` is 1, `best` is the maximum value of `best` and `curr + c[i]` for all iterations, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `curr` is 1.**
