Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `t` is 1, `best` is `max(1, b[1] - a[1] + 1 + c[1])`, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and the condition `i != n - 1` holds true***
