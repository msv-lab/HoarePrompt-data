The code snippet `b = [int(bi) for bi in input().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `b`. The variables `a`, `curr`, `best`, `i`, and `t` are not affected by this operation. The initial state of `a[i]` and `b[i]` is given as the minimum and maximum of the original values, respectively, but these are not directly impacted by the assignment to `b`.

Since the input for `b` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in `b`. However, we know that `b` is now a list of integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `t` is 1, `curr` is the final value of `curr` after all iterations, `best` is the maximum value attained by `curr + c[i]` during the loop, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the input integer.**
