The code snippet reads an integer value from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `i` to `n`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `t` is 1, `curr` is the final value of `curr` after all iterations, `best` is the maximum value attained by `curr + c[i]` during the loop, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the input integer.**
