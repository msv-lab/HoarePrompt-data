The function `func_2(best)` is called, but the function itself is not defined in the given code snippet. Therefore, the value of `curr` remains unchanged, and the value of `best` is passed to `func_2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `curr` is either 1 or adjusted based on the final values of `a[n-1]` and `b[n-1]`, `n` is a positive integer, `best` is the maximum value obtained during the iterations of the loop, `func_2(best)` has been called.**
