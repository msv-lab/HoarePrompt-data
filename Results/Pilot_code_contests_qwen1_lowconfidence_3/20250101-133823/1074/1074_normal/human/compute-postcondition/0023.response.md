Postcondition: ***`args` is a list containing at least two elements, `at_start` is `False`, a newline character (`'\n'`) is written to the file. If `kwargs` does not contain the key 'flush' or the value of `flush` is `False`, `file.flush()` has been called. If `kwargs` contains the key 'flush' with any value other than `False`, no additional operations are performed.***
