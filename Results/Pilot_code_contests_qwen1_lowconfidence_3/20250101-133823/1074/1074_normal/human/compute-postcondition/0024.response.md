The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly from the given code snippet. Instead, it appears to process some data internally or through external means not specified in the parameter constraints. The constraints provided describe variables (`t`, `n`, `c_i`, `a_i`, `b_i`) but do not indicate they are passed as arguments to the function.

Given the output cases are not directly tied to the parameters described in the function definition, we can infer that the function `func_2` might handle multiple test cases (`t`), each involving integers `n`, `c_i`, `a_i`, and `b_i` under specific constraints. However, since the function definition itself does not include these parameters, the output cannot be directly mapped to the function's parameters.

Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It processes multiple test cases involving integers `t`, `n`, `c_i`, `a_i`, and `b_i` and returns output based on these values.**
