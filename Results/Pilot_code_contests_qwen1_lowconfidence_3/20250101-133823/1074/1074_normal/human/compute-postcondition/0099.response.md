Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `t` is 1, `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[3]`, `a[3]` is the minimum of the original `a[3]` and `b[3]`, `b[3]` is the maximum of the original `a[3]` and `b[3]`, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `curr` is 1. If `a[i + 1] == b[i + 1]`, then `curr` remains unchanged.***
