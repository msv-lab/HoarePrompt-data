The code updates the variable `best` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr + c[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 3
- `curr` is either `b[2] - a[2] + 1 + a[3] + c[2] - b[3] + 1` (if `a[3]` does not equal `b[3]`) or 1 (if `a[3]` equals `b[3]`)
- `n` is greater than 3
- `best` is `max(best, b[2] - a[2] + 1 + c[2])`

We need to calculate the new value of `best` based on these conditions.

Since `i` is 3, `c[i]` becomes `c[3]`. The value of `curr` is given by the condition: if `a[3]` does not equal `b[3]`, then `curr` is `b[2] - a[2] + 1 + a[3] + c[2] - b[3] + 1`; otherwise, `curr` is 1.

Let's denote the initial value of `best` as `B`. After executing the code, the new value of `best` will be the maximum of `B` and `curr + c[3]`.

So, the new value of `best` is:
- `max(B, b[2] - a[2] + 1 + a[3] + c[2] - b[3] + 1 + c[3])` if `a[3]` does not equal `b[3]`
- `max(B, 1 + c[3])` if `a[3]` equals `b[3]`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is 3; `curr` is either `b[2] - a[2] + 1 + a[3] + c[2] - b[3] + 1` (if `a[3]` does not equal `b[3]`) or 1 (if `a[3]` equals `b[3]`); `n` is greater than 3; `best` is `max(B, b[2] - a[2] + 1 + a[3] + c[2] - b[3] + 1 + c[3])` if `a[3]` does not equal `b[3]`; `best` is `max(B, 1 + c[3])` if `a[3]` equals `b[3]`.**
