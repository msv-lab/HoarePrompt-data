To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues to run. The loop runs for each iteration of `t`, which means the loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n`
- `t` is `0`
- `curr` is the final value of `curr` after all iterations
- `best` is the maximum value attained by `curr + c[i]` during the loop
- `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`
- `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`
- `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `a` is a list of integers from the input
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be incremented by 1, making it `1`. All other values remain unchanged because the loop body has not yet executed for this new value of `t`.

State: **`i` is `n`, `t` is `1`, `curr` is the final value of `curr` after all iterations, `best` is the maximum value attained by `curr + c[i]` during the loop, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
