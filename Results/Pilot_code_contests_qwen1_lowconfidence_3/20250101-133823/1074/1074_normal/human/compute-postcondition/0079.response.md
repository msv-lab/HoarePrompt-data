The code snippet updates the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to be the minimum and maximum of their current values, respectively. Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can only say that for each index `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `a[i]` will be the smaller of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `b[i]` will be the larger of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `t` is 1, `curr` is the final value of `curr` after all iterations, `best` is the maximum value attained by `curr + c[i]` during the loop, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
