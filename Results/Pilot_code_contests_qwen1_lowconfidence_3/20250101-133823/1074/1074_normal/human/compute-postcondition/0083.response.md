The code swaps `a[i]` and `b[i]` such that `a[i]` becomes the minimum of the two values and `b[i]` becomes the maximum of the two values. Given that `i` is 2, the specific elements involved are `a[2]` and `b[2]`.

Let's denote the initial values of `a[2]` and `b[2]` as `va` and `vb` respectively.

- If `va` <= `vb`, then `a[2]` remains `va` and `b[2]` becomes `vb`.
- If `va` > `vb`, then `a[2]` becomes `vb` and `b[2]` becomes `va`.

Since the initial values of `a[2]` and `b[2]` are not explicitly given, we will keep them in terms of their initial values.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `t` is 1, `curr` is the value of `curr` from the previous iteration, `best` is the value of `best` from the previous iteration, `a[2]` is the minimum of its original values, `b[2]` is the maximum of its original values, `c` is the same list of integers**
