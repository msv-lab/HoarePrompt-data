The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `c_i` is an integer such that 2 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `a_i` is an integer such that a_1 = -1 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ c_{i-1}, and `b_i` is an integer such that b_1 = -1 and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ c_{i-1}; `sep` is a space if 'sep' is not in kwargs, otherwise the value of 'sep' in kwargs; `file` is sys.stdout if 'file' is not in kwargs, otherwise the value of 'file' in kwargs; `at_start` is True.**
