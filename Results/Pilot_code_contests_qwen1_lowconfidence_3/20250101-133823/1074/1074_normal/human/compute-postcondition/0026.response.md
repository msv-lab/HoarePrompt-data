The variable `curr` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `n` and `best` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `curr` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `best` is `max(best, b[2] - a[2] + 1 + c[2])`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `curr` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `best` is `max(best, b[2] - a[2] + 1 + c[2])`**
