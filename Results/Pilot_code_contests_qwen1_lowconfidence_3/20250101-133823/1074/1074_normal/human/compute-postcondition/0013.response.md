The line `at_start = False` sets the variable `at_start` to the boolean value `False`. The initial state of `args` being a list with at least two elements and `at_start` remaining `False` does not get altered by this assignment. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `at_start`.

Output State: **`args` has at least two elements, and `at_start` is False**
