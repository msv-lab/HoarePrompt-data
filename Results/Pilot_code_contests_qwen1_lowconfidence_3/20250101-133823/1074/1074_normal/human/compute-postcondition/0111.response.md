Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads additional parameters including an integer `n`, a list `c` of integers, and two lists `a` and `b` of integers. It then processes these inputs by updating `a` and `b` to ensure `a[i]` is the minimum and `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The function calculates a `best` value which is the maximum sum of consecutive chain lengths starting from the second vertex to the end of each chain, considering the connections defined by `a` and `b`. After processing all test cases, it calls another function `func_2` with the final `best` value. The function ensures that the final state includes the updated values of `a` and `b` for each chain, the `best` value calculated, and the `curr` value set to 1. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` for any chain, in which case `curr` is reset to 1. The function does not return any value but updates internal states and calls another function with the result.**
