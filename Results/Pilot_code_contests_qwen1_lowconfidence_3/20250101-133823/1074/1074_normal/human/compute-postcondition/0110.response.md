The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: An integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), indicating the number of chains.
- `c`: A list of `n` integers where \(2 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\), representing the number of vertices in each chain.
- `a`: A list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq c_{i-1}\), indicating the vertex connected to the first vertex of each chain.
- `b`: A list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq c_{i-1}\), indicating the vertex connected to the last vertex of each chain.

The function returns a value based on the structure and connections defined by the input parameters. However, since no specific output conditions are given, we can only state that the function processes the input parameters according to the problem's requirements.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t`, an integer `n`, a list `c` of integers, and two lists `a` and `b` of integers. It processes these inputs according to the problem statement and returns a result based on the specified structure and connections.**
