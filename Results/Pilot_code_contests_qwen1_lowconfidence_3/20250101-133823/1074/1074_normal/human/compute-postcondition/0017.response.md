The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file, but does not change the values of the variables `args` or `at_start`. Since the precondition was that `args` has at least two elements and `at_start` is False, these conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` has at least two elements, `at_start` is False**
