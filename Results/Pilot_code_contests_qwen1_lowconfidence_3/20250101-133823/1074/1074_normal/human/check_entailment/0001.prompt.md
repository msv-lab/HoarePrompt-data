You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have n chains, the i-th chain consists of c_i vertices. Vertices in each chain are numbered independently from 1 to c_i along the chain. In other words, the i-th chain is the undirected graph with c_i vertices and (c_i - 1) edges connecting the j-th and the (j + 1)-th vertices for each 1 ≤ j < c_i.

Now you decided to unite chains in one graph in the following way: 

  1. the first chain is skipped; 
  2. the 1-st vertex of the i-th chain is connected by an edge with the a_i-th vertex of the (i - 1)-th chain; 
  3. the last (c_i-th) vertex of the i-th chain is connected by an edge with the b_i-th vertex of the (i - 1)-th chain. 

<image> Picture of the first test case. Dotted lines are the edges added during uniting process

Calculate the length of the longest simple cycle in the resulting graph.

A simple cycle is a chain where the first and last vertices are connected as well. If you travel along the simple cycle, each vertex of this cycle will be visited exactly once.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains the single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of chains you have.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (2 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9) — the number of vertices in the corresponding chains.

The third line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_1 = -1; 1 ≤ a_i ≤ c_{i - 1}).

The fourth line of each test case contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (b_1 = -1; 1 ≤ b_i ≤ c_{i - 1}).

Both a_1 and b_1 are equal to -1, they aren't used in graph building and given just for index consistency. It's guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print the length of the longest simple cycle.

Example

Input

4
3 4 3 3

-1 2 2 3

5 6
-1 5
-1 1

3 5 2
-1 1 1

8

Note

In the first test case, the longest simple cycle is shown below: 

<image>

We can't increase it with the first chain, since in such case it won't be simple — the vertex 2 on the second chain will break simplicity.
Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
import os
import sys
from io import BytesIO, IOBase
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        c = [int(ci) for ci in input().split()]
        a = [int(ai) for ai in input().split()]
        b = [int(bi) for bi in input().split()]
        for i in range(n):
            (a[i], b[i]) = (min(a[i], b[i]), max(a[i], b[i]))
        best = 1
        curr = b[1] - a[1] + 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            best = max(best, curr + c[i])
            if i != n - 1:
                curr += a[i + 1] + (c[i] - b[i + 1] + 1)
                if a[i + 1] == b[i + 1]:
                    curr = 1
        func_2(best)

#Function 2:
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
