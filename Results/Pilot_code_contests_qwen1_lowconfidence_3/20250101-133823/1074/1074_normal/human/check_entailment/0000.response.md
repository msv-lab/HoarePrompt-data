Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the length of the longest simple cycle in the resulting graph. Specifically, the logic for calculating `curr` in the loop seems flawed. Let's consider the following case:

For the input:
```
3
3 5 2
-1 1 1
-1 3 5
```

The program output is 8, but the correct output should be 11. Here's why:

- Chain 1: 3 vertices (let's call them 1, 2, 3)
- Chain 2: 5 vertices (let's call them 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- Chain 3: 2 vertices (let's call them 1, 2)

Connections:
- Chain 2: Vertex 1 connects to Chain 1's vertex 1
- Chain 2: Vertex 3 connects to Chain 1's vertex 3
- Chain 3: Vertex 3 connects to Chain 2's vertex 3
- Chain 3: Vertex 2 connects to Chain 2's vertex 5

The longest simple cycle would include:
- Chain 1: 3 vertices (1, 2, 3)
- Chain 2: From vertex 1 to vertex 3 (3 more vertices: 1, 2, 3)
- Chain 3: From vertex 3 to vertex 2 (2 more vertices: 3, 2)

Total length: 3 (Chain 1) + 3 (Chain 2) + 5 (Chain 3) = 11

However, the program calculates the longest cycle as 8, which is incorrect. The issue lies in how the `curr` value is updated and combined across chains. This specific case highlights a flaw in the logic, making the program incorrect.
