t is an integer representing the number of test cases; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, indicating the number of chains; c is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, representing the number of vertices in each chain; a and b are lists of n integers where a_i and b_i are such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ c_{i-1}, indicating the vertices connected to the first and last vertices of each chain respectively; and t, n, c, a, b are structured as described in the problem statement.
