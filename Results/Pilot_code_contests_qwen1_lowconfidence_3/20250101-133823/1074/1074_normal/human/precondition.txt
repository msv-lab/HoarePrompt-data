t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The lists c, a, and b are defined as follows: c is a list of n integers such that 2 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, and a and b are lists of n integers each, with a_1 = -1 and b_1 = -1, and for 2 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ c_{i-1} and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ c_{i-1}. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
