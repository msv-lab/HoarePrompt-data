You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There is a staircase with N steps. Takahashi is now standing at the foot of the stairs, that is, on the 0-th step. He can climb up one or two steps at a time.

However, the treads of the a_1-th, a_2-th, a_3-th, \ldots, a_M-th steps are broken, so it is dangerous to set foot on those steps.

How many are there to climb up to the top step, that is, the N-th step, without setting foot on the broken steps? Find the count modulo 1\ 000\ 000\ 007.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 0 \leq M \leq N-1
* 1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_M \leq N-1

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M
a_1
a_2
.
.
.
a_M


Output

Print the number of ways to climb up the stairs under the condition, modulo 1\ 000\ 000\ 007.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^5, M is an integer such that 0 <= M <= N-1, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_M are integers such that 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_M <= N-1.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
    dp = [(0) for i in range(0, n + 1)]
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(0, m):
        a = int(raw_input())
        
        dp[a] = -1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input (must be less than or equal to the number of inputs given), `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user, `i` is `m`, `a` is the last integer input by the user.
    for step in range(1, n + 1):
        if dp[step] < 0:
            continue
        
        ans = 0
        
        for prev in [1, 2]:
            if step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0:
                ans += dp[step - prev]
        
        dp[step] = ans
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\), `n` is a positive integer within the range \([1, N]\), `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user, `i = M`, `a` is the last integer input by the user, `ans` is the sum of `dp[step - prev]` for all valid `prev` in `[1, 2]` where `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0`, `dp[step]` is `ans` for all valid `step` values where `dp[step] < 0` is not true, `dp[n + 1]` is the final value of `ans` after executing the loop.
    print(dp[n] % 1000000007)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
