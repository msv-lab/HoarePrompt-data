Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem described. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the values of `N` and `M` followed by the list of broken steps `a_1, a_2, ..., a_M`. This aligns with the problem statement which specifies the format of the input.

2. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - The array `dp` is initialized with zeros and `dp[0]` is set to 1, indicating that there is one way to be at the starting point (step 0). This is consistent with the base case required for the dynamic programming approach.

3. **Marking Broken Steps**:
   - For each broken step `a_i`, the corresponding index in `dp` is set to `-1`. This ensures that the DP table correctly avoids these positions when calculating the number of ways to reach the top step.

4. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**:
   - The outer loop iterates over each step from `1` to `N`. For each step, the program calculates the number of ways to reach that step by considering the previous steps (`step - 1` and `step - 2`). It skips the calculation for broken steps by checking if `dp[step] < 0`.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo `1000000007` as specified in the problem description. This ensures that the output remains within the specified range and handles large numbers appropriately.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `dp[N]` which represents the number of ways to reach the top step, modulo `1000000007`. This is exactly what the problem requires.

Since the program follows the problem description accurately and handles all constraints and requirements specified, the correctness is **True**.
