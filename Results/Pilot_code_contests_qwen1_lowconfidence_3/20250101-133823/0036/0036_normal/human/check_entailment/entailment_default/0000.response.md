Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where a step is both reachable via taking one step and taking two steps, and both of these steps are broken. Specifically, the code does not properly account for the fact that a step can be reached from two previous steps, and if both of these previous steps are marked as broken, the current step should still be considered reachable (with a count of 0).

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

Input:
```
6 2
2
3
```

According to the problem description, the code should count the number of ways to reach the 6th step without stepping on the broken steps at the 2nd and 3rd steps. The correct answer should be 0 because stepping on either the 2nd or 3rd step would result in stepping on a broken step.

However, the current implementation of the code will incorrectly count the number of ways to reach the 6th step. It will consider the 4th and 5th steps as potential ways to reach the 6th step, even though the 2nd and 3rd steps are broken, leading to an incorrect count.

Here is a corrected version of the code that handles this edge case correctly:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    dp = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0] = 1
    broken_steps = set(map(int, input().split()))
    
    for step in range(1, n + 1):
        if step in broken_steps:
            dp[step] = 0
        else:
            dp[step] = (dp[step - 1] + dp[step - 2]) % 1000000007
    
    print(dp[n])

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version initializes the `dp` array and sets the values for broken steps directly, ensuring that the count for any step that cannot be taken due to broken steps is correctly handled.
