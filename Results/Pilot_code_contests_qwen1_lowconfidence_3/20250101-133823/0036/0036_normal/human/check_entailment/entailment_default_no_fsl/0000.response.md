Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a logical error in handling the constraints and the problem requirements. Specifically, the code does not correctly handle the scenario where the first or second step is broken. 

For instance, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3 1
1
```

Expected output:
```
0
```

This is because stepping on the 1st step is not allowed, and there are no other steps to reach, making it impossible to reach the 3rd step. However, the provided code will incorrectly output `1` because it initializes `dp[0]` to 1 and proceeds with the calculations without properly accounting for the fact that the 1st step cannot be used.

To fix this, the code needs to handle the initial conditions more carefully, ensuring that steps that are broken do not allow any transitions into subsequent steps. This can be achieved by setting the initial conditions and transitions appropriately to reflect the broken steps.

Since the code fails to handle this specific case correctly, the overall correctness is **False**.
