Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical issue in how it handles broken steps. Specifically, when a step is marked as `-1` in the `dp` array, the program continues to the next step without properly accounting for the fact that stepping on a broken step should reset the count for subsequent steps. This leads to incorrect results in scenarios where stepping on a broken step causes a break in the valid path.

For example, consider the following input:

```
6 1
3
```

The correct output should be `4` because the valid paths are:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 (not allowed)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
3. 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 (not allowed)
4. 0 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6

However, the given program will not correctly account for the fact that step `3` is broken and should invalidate any paths that pass through it. This leads to an incorrect count of `3` instead of `4`.

To fix this, the program needs to reset the count for any step that is broken. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    dp = [0 for i in range(0, n + 1)]
    dp[0] = 1
    broken_steps = set()
    
    for i in range(m):
        a = int(input())
        dp[a] = -1
        broken_steps.add(a)
    
    for step in range(1, n + 1):
        if step in broken_steps:
            dp[step] = 0
            continue
        ans = 0
        for prev in [1, 2]:
            if step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0:
                ans += dp[step - prev]
        dp[step] = ans
    
    print(dp[n] % 1000000007)
```

This corrected version ensures that any step marked as broken (`-1`) in the `dp` array is properly handled by setting `dp[step]` to `0`, thus correctly invalidating paths that would otherwise pass through broken steps.
