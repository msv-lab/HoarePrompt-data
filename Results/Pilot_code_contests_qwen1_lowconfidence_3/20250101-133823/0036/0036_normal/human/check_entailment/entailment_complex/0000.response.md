Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading two integers `n` and `m` representing the total number of steps and the number of broken steps, respectively.
   - It initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` of size `n + 1` with all elements set to 0.
   - `dp[0]` is set to 1 because there is exactly one way to stay at the starting point (do nothing).

2. **Handling Broken Steps:**
   - The program reads `m` integers (representing broken steps) and sets `dp[a]` to -1 for each broken step `a`.
   - This ensures that the DP state for these steps is invalid (cannot be reached).

3. **Dynamic Programming Calculation:**
   - The outer loop iterates over each step from 1 to `n`.
   - For each step, if `dp[step]` is valid (not -1), it calculates the number of ways to reach that step by considering the previous steps (either one or two steps back).
   - The inner loop sums the valid contributions from `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` to `dp[step]`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - After filling the DP array, the program prints the value of `dp[n]` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Why the Program Follows the Problem Description:

- **Initial Conditions:** The DP array `dp` is correctly initialized, and `dp[0]` is set to 1, ensuring there is one way to start.
- **Broken Step Handling:** The program correctly marks broken steps by setting `dp[a]` to -1, preventing any path from including these steps.
- **Dynamic Programming Transition:** The logic for transitioning from one step to another (either one or two steps back) is implemented correctly, adhering to the problem constraints.
- **Modulo Operation:** The final result is correctly computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) as required by the problem.

Since the program accurately follows all aspects of the problem description, including handling of input, initialization, and dynamic programming transitions, the program is correct.
