Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error when handling the constraints and the problem requirements. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the starting step (0) or the final step (N) might be broken. 

For instance, consider the following input:

```
6 1
0
```

In this case, the 0-th step is broken, which means it's impossible to start climbing. However, the program initializes `dp[0]` to 1, assuming it's possible to be on the 0-th step, and proceeds with the dynamic programming calculation. This leads to an incorrect result because it doesn't account for the fact that starting from the broken step is impossible.

To fix this, the program should initialize `dp[0]` to 0 if the 0-th step is broken and ensure that the initial conditions are correctly handled for any broken steps.
