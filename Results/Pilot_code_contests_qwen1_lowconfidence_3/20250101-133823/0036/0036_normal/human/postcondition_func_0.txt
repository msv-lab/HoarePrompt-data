The function processes a set of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_M` where each `a_i` is an integer between 1 and `N-1` and calculates a dynamic programming array `dp` based on these inputs. Initially, `dp[0]` is set to 1 and `dp[a_i]` is set to -1 for each `a_i`. For each position `step` from 1 to `n`, the function calculates the value of `dp[step]` as the sum of `dp[step - prev]` for `prev` in `[1, 2]` where `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0`. Finally, the function prints the value of `dp[n]` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function handles edge cases where `n` or `m` might be zero and ensures that all possible transitions are considered during the calculation.
