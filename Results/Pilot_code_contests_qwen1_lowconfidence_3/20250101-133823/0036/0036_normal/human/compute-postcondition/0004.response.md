The code reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^5, `M` is an integer such that 0 <= M <= N-1, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0] = 1` and all other elements equal to 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the third integer input**
