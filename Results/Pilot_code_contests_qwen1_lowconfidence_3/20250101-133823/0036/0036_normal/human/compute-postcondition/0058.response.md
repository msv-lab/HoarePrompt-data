The code `ans += dp[step - prev]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `dp[step - prev]` to it. From the initial state, we know that `dp[step - prev]` is either -1 or 1 because `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user, and `dp[0] = 1`. Since `prev` is 2, `step - prev` can be calculated as `step - 2`.

However, the exact value of `dp[step - 2]` depends on whether `step - 2` was input by the user or not. If `step - 2` was input, `dp[step - 2] = -1`; otherwise, `dp[step - 2] = 1`. Therefore, `ans` is updated by either adding -1 or 1 to its current value.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, \( N \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq N \leq 10^5 \), \( M \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq M \leq N-1 \), \( n \) is a positive integer within the range \([1, N]\), `dp` is a list of length \( n + 2 \) with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user, `i = M`, `a` is the last integer input by the user, `ans` is updated by adding `dp[step - 2]` (which is either -1 or 1) to its current value, `step` is an integer, and `prev` is 2.**
