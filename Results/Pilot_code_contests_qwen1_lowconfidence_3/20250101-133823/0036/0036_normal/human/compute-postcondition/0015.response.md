The code `continue` is used in a loop context to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given snippet, the code does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The `continue` statement here is essentially a no-op (no operation) in this context.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\), `n` is a positive integer within the range \([1, N]\), `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user, `i` is `m`, `a` is the last integer input by the user, and the current value of `dp[step]` is less than 0**
