Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\), `n` is a positive integer within the range \([1, N]\), `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user, `i = M`, `a` is the last integer input by the user, `ans` is updated by adding the value of `dp[step - prev]` to its current value if `step - prev \geq 0` and `dp[step - prev] \geq 0`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, and regardless of whether the condition `step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0` is met, `ans` remains in the same state as after the if condition check.***
