Output State: **`total` is 0, `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\), `n` is a positive integer within the range \([1, N]\), `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user, `i = M`, `a` is the last integer input by the user, `ans` is the sum of all `dp[step - prev]` where `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0` for both `prev` in `[1, 2]`, `step` is an integer. If the loop does not execute, `ans` remains 0.**
