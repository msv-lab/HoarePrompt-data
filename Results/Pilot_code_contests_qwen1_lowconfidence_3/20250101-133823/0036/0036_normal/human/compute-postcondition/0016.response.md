Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\), `n` is a positive integer within the range \([1, N]\), `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user, `i` is `m`, `a` is the last integer input by the user, and if `dp[step] < 0`, the state remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition only accounts for the if part condition being true.***
