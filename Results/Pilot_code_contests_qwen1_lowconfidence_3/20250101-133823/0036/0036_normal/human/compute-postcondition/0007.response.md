The code snippet assigns the value of the input to `a`. The value of `a` is obtained from `int(raw_input())`, which means it will be an integer entered by the user. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\)
- `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\)
- `n` is the first integer input
- `m` is the second integer input
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1`
- `i` is 1
- `a` is the third integer input

After the code `a = int(raw_input())` is executed, the value of `a` is updated to the integer input from the user, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1`, `i` is 1, `a` is the integer input from the user**
