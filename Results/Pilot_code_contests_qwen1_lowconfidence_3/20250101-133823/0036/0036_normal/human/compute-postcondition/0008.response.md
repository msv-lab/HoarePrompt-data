The code `dp[a] = -1` updates the value of `dp[a]` to `-1`. The previous value of `dp[a]` could be anything (since it was not specified initially in the context, but it is known that `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a]` was set to `-1` before this line), but now it is explicitly set to `-1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1`, `i` is 1, `a` is the integer input from the user**
