The code assigns the value `-1` to `dp[a]`. The value of `a` is the integer input from the user, which means `dp[a]` is specifically set to `-1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input (must be greater than 1), `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1`, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer input from the user**
