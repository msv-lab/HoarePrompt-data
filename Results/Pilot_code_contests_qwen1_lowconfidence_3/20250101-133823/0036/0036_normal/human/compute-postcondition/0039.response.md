`ans` is incremented by the value of `dp[step - prev]`. Here, `step` is equal to `i` which is `M`, and `prev` is `2`. The value of `dp[step - prev]` is `dp[M - 2]`. Since `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user, and `M` is one of those `a`, `dp[M - 2]` is `-1`. Therefore, `ans` is incremented by `-1`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\), `n` is a positive integer within the range \([1, N]\), `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user, `i = M`, `a` is the last integer input by the user, `dp[n + 1]` is the value of `ans` from the previous iteration, `prev` is 2, `ans` is `ans - 1`**
