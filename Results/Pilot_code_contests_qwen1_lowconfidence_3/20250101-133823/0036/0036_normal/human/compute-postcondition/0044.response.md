Output State: **`total` is 0, `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\), `n` is a positive integer within the range \([1, N]\), `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user, `i = M`, `a` is the last integer input by the user, `dp[n + 1]` is the final value of `ans` after executing the loop, `ans` is the sum of `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` for all valid `step - 1` and `step - 2` values where `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` are both non-negative.**
