The `continue` statement in the provided code does not change the values of any variables; it only causes the next iteration of the loop to occur if the code is within a loop structure. Since there is no explicit loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect, and the variables retain their initial or last known states.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\), `n` is a positive integer within the range \([1, N]\), `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user, `i = M`, `a` is the last integer input by the user, `ans` is `dp[n + 1]`**
