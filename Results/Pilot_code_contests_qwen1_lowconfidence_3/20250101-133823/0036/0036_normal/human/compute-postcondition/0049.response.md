The given code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This means that regardless of the previous value of `ans`, it is now explicitly set to 0. No other changes are made to any of the other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\), `n` is a positive integer within the range \([1, N]\), `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user, `i = M`, `a` is the last integer input by the user, `ans` is 0.**
