The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is 0; `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\); `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\); `n` is a positive integer within the range \([1, N]\); `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user; `i = M`; `a` is the last integer input by the user; `ans` is the sum of `dp[n]` and `dp[n - 1]` if certain conditions are met; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged; `dp[n + 1]` is equal to `ans`.**
