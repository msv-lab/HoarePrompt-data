Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\), `n` is a positive integer within the range \([1, N]\), `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user, `i = M`, `a` is the last integer input by the user, `ans` is the sum of `dp[step - prev]` for all valid `prev` in `[1, 2]` where `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0`, `dp[step]` is `ans` for all valid `step` values where `dp[step] < 0` is not true, `dp[n + 1]` is the final value of `ans` after executing the loop.**
