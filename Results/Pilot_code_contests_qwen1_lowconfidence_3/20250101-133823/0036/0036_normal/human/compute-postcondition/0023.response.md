The code snippet `ans += dp[step - prev]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `dp[step - prev]` to `ans`. However, the initial values of `step` and `prev` are not provided, and they are not defined in the initial state. Also, the values of `dp`, `step`, and `prev` are not explicitly given, and their current values are not known.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the only variable that is updated is `ans`. The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `dp[step - prev]`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\), `n` is a positive integer within the range \([1, N]\), `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user, `i = M`, `a` is the last integer input by the user, `ans` is updated by adding the value of `dp[step - prev]` to its current value**.
