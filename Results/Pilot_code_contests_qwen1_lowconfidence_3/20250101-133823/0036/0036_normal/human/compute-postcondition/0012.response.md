Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input (must be less than or equal to the number of inputs given), `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user, `i` is `m`, `a` is the last integer input by the user.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs exactly `m` times, where `m` is an integer input.
- Each time the loop runs, an integer `a` is read from the user, and `dp[a]` is set to `-1`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `m`, and `dp` will contain `-1` at the index corresponding to each integer `a` that was input during the loop iterations.
- The values of `N`, `M`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged unless specified otherwise.
- The variable `a` will be the last integer input by the user because the loop reads `m` integers, and `a` will be the last one.
