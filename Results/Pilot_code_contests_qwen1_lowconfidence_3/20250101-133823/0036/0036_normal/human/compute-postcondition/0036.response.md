`ans` is incremented by the value of `dp[step - prev]`. Since `dp[step - prev] >= 0`, the value of `ans` changes. However, the exact value of `ans` is not specified because it depends on the value of `dp[step - prev]`. All other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\), `n` is a positive integer within the range \([1, N]\), `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user, `i = M`, `a` is the last integer input by the user, `dp[n + 1]` is equal to `ans`, where `ans` is the sum of `dp[n]` and `dp[n - 1]` if `dp[step] < 0`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, `ans` is updated by adding `dp[step - prev]` to its current value, `prev` is one of the values in the list `[1, 2]`, `step` is an integer such that `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0`**.
