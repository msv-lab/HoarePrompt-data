The code `dp[a] = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the element `dp[a]`. Here, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0] = 1` and all other elements initially equal to `0`. The value of `a` is determined by the third integer input. All other variables and their preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^5, `M` is an integer such that 0 <= M <= N-1, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1`, `i` is 0, `a` is the third integer input**
