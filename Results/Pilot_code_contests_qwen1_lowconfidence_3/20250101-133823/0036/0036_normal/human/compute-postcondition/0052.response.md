The code snippet `ans += dp[step - prev]` increments `ans` by the value of `dp[step - prev]`. Given the precondition that `(step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0)` is true, we know that `dp[step - prev]` is a non-negative value. Since `dp[step - prev]` is a specific value from the list `dp`, and given that `dp[step - prev] >= 0`, we can include this specific value in our output state.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. `ans` is initially 0.
2. `dp[step - prev]` is a specific non-negative value from the list `dp`.
3. The code adds this value to `ans`.

Since the exact value of `dp[step - prev]` is not specified, we represent it as `dp_val`, where `dp_val` is a non-negative value from `dp`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\), `n` is a positive integer within the range \([1, N]\), `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user, `i = M`, `a` is the last integer input by the user, `ans` is 0 plus `dp_val`, `step` is an integer, `prev` is an integer, and the condition `(step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0)` is true.**

To make it more precise, we can say:

Output State: **`total` is 0, `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\), `n` is a positive integer within the range \([1, N]\), `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user, `i = M`, `a` is the last integer input by the user, `ans` is `dp[step - prev]`, `step` is an integer, `prev` is an integer, and the condition `(step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0)` is true.**
