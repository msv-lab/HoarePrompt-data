The code initializes a list `dp` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This means that each element in the `dp` list will be 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^5, `M` is an integer such that 0 <= M <= N-1, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements equal to 0.**
