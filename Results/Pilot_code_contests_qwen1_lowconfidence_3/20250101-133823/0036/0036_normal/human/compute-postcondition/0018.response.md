Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
1. \( N \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq N \leq 10^5 \)
2. \( M \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq M \leq N-1 \)
3. \( n \) is a positive integer within the range \([1, N]\)
4. `dp` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) with \( dp[0] = 1 \) and \( dp[a] = -1 \) for each \( a \) that was input by the user
5. \( i = M \)
6. \( a \) is the last integer input by the user
7. \( ans = 0 \)
8. If \( dp[step] < 0 \), the state remains unchanged

### For Loop:
```
for prev in [1, 2]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop is iterating over the list `[1, 2]`. The variable `prev` takes on the values `1` and `2` in each iteration.

#### Iteration 1: `prev = 1`
- No additional conditions or state changes are needed for the first value `1`.

#### Iteration 2: `prev = 2`
- Similarly, no additional conditions or state changes are needed for the second value `2`.

### Conclusion:
The loop itself does not depend on any external variables or change the state beyond what is already provided. Therefore, there are no specific state adjustments required for the loop to execute based on the given conditions.

### Final Answer:
Since no additional state adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute based on the provided information:

State: **`total` is 0, `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\), `n` is a positive integer within the range \([1, N]\), `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user, `i = M`, `a` is the last integer input by the user, `ans` is 0, and if `dp[step] < 0`, the state remains unchanged.**

This means that the state remains as given without any modifications needed for the loop to execute.
