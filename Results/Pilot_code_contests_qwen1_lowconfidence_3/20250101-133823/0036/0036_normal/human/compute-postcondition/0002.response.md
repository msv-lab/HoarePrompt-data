The code `dp[0] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the first element of the list `dp`. This affects the list `dp` specifically. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^5, `M` is an integer such that 0 <= M <= N-1, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0] = 1` and all other elements equal to 0.**
