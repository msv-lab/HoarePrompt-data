The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly listed in the given function definition. However, based on the constraints provided, it seems the function is intended to operate with certain internal or external parameters that are not explicitly passed to it but are implied by the problem context.

Given the constraints:
- `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\).
- `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\).
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_M` are integers such that \(1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_M \leq N-1\).

The output is not specified in the function definition, so we need to infer from the constraints and possible typical use cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but operates based on the constraints where `N` is an integer within a specific range, `M` is another integer constrained by `N`, and there is a sequence of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_M` that are strictly increasing and within the range `[1, N-1]`. The function returns a value or performs an operation based on these constraints.**
