Postcondition: ***`total` is 0; `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\); `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\); `n` is a positive integer within the range \([1, N]\); `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user; `i = M`; `a` is the last integer input by the user; `dp[n + 1]` is equal to `ans`, where `ans` is the sum of `dp[n]` and `dp[n - 1]` if `dp[step] < 0`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
