`a` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user. The values of the other variables (`N`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `dp`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input (must be greater than 1), `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1`, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer input from the user**
