`n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input split by space using `map(int, raw_input().split(' '))`. The initial conditions for `N` and `M` are still valid, but their specific values are now assigned to `n` and `m`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^5, `M` is an integer such that 0 <= M <= N-1, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input.**
