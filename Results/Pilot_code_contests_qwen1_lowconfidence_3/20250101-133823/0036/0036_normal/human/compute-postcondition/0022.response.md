Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\)
   - `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\)
   - `n` is a positive integer within the range \([1, N]\)
   - `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user
   - `i = M`
   - `a` is the last integer input by the user
   - `ans` is incremented by the value of `dp[step - prev]` if `step - prev \geq 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for prev in [1, 2]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The for loop iterates over the list `[1, 2]`.
   - This means the loop will run twice, once for `prev = 1` and once for `prev = 2`.

4. **Adjusting the States for the First Iteration (prev = 1):**
   - The state remains as given since the loop is about to start iterating over `prev = 1`.

5. **Adjusting the States for the Second Iteration (prev = 2):**
   - After the first iteration (with `prev = 1`), the state does not change.
   - The loop will then move to the next iteration with `prev = 2`.
   - No new variables are introduced or modified in the loop body (since it is omitted).

6. **Final State at the Start of the Second Iteration (prev = 2):**
   - `total` is still 0
   - `N` remains the same
   - `M` remains the same
   - `n` remains the same
   - `dp` remains the same
   - `i` remains the same (`i = M`)
   - `a` remains the same (last integer input by the user)
   - `ans` remains unchanged from the previous iteration

Therefore, the states do not change from the previous iteration when transitioning to the next iteration of the loop.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`total` is 0, `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\), `n` is a positive integer within the range \([1, N]\), `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[a] = -1` for each `a` that was input by the user, `i = M`, `a` is the last integer input by the user, `ans` remains unchanged**.
