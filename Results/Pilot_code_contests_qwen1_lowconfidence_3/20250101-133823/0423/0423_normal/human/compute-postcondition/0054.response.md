The code initializes `max_` to 0. This variable is not related to any other variables in the initial state and does not affect their values. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`node1` is `n - 1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, for all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1` (`n - 1`). Otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`; `lens` is an empty list, `max_` is 0**
