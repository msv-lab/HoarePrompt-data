Postcondition: ***`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `num2` is the value at index `node2` of `nums`, `node1` is less than `n-1`, and `n` is greater than `node2`. If `abs(num1 - num2) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains the additional element `node1`. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.***
