The code snippet `lens.append(len_)` appends the value of `len_` to the list `lens`. Since `lens` initially contains only one element, the value of `len_`, appending `len_` again means `lens` now contains two elements, both of which are `len_`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`node1` is `n - 1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, for all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1` (`n - 1`); otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`; `lens` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `len_`; `max_` is the maximum of `len_` and the previous value of `max_`; `node` is `0`.
