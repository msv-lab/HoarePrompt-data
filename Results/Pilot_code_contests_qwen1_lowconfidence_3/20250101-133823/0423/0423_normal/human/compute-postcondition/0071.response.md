Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is given as:
   - `node1` is `n - 1`
   - `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`
   - For all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1`; otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`
   - `lens` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `len_`
   - `max_` is the maximum of `len_` and the previous value of `max_`
   - `node` is `1`

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   len_ = max([lens[kid] for kid in graph[node]]) + 1
   ```

3. Let's break down what this line does:
   - It iterates over each `kid` (which is a node in the `graph`) that contains `node` (`1`).
   - For each `kid`, it fetches the value from the `lens` list.
   - It calculates the maximum of these values.
   - It adds `1` to this maximum value to get `len_`.

4. Since `node` is `1`, we need to know which nodes in `graph` contain `node`. From the initial state, we know that for each `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, `graph[node2]` contains `node1` if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`.

5. Therefore, the list comprehension `[lens[kid] for kid in graph[node]]` will evaluate to a list of two elements, both equal to `len_` (since `node` is connected to exactly two nodes in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`).

6. So, the expression `max([lens[kid] for kid in graph[node]])` will simply be `len_`, and `len_ = len_ + 1`.

7. Thus, the new value of `len_` will be `len_ + 1`.

8. Since `max_` was previously defined as the maximum of `len_` and the previous value of `max_`, and now `len_` is updated to `len_ + 1`, `max_` will be `len_ + 1`.

9. The `lens` list remains unchanged.

10. All other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`node1` is `n - 1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, for all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1`; otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`; `lens` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `len_ + 1`; `max_` is `len_ + 1`; `node` is `1`.**
