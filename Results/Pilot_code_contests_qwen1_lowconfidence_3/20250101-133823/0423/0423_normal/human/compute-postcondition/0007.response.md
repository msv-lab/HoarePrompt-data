`num2` is assigned the value at index `node2` of `nums`. Since `node2` is equal to `node1 + 1`, `num2` is assigned the value at index `node1 + 1` of `nums`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `node2` is `node1 + 1`, `n` must be greater than `node1 + 1`, and `num2` is the value at index `node1 + 1` of `nums`.

Output State: **`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `node2` is `node1 + 1`, `n` must be greater than `node1 + 1`, and `num2` is the value at index `node1 + 1` of `nums`**.
