The code initializes `len_` to 1. This assignment directly impacts the variable `len_`. The initial values of other variables remain unchanged. Let's update the values accordingly:

- `node1` is `n - 1`
- `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`
- For all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1` (`n - 1`); otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`
- `lens` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `len_`
- `max_` is the maximum of `len_` and the previous value of `max_`
- `node` is `1`
- `len_` is now `1`

Output State: **`node1` is `n - 1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, for all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1` (`n - 1`); otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`; `lens` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `1`; `max_` is the maximum of `1` and the previous value of `max_`; `node` is `1`; `len_` is `1`**
