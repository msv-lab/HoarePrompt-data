The code assigns the value of `nums[node2]` to `num2`. However, `node2` is not defined in the initial state. Since `node2` is not specified, it cannot be determined what the new value of `num2` will be. The only change is that `num2` is now assigned the value of `nums[node2]`.

Output State: **`node1` is less than \( n \), `n` is greater than \( node1 \), `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, `num2` is the value of `nums[node2]`**
