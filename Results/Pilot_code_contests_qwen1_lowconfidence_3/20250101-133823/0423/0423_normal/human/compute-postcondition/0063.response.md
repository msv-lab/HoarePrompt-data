Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial State
- `node1` is `n - 1`
- `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`
- For all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1` (`n - 1`); otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`
- `lens` is a list containing one element (the value of `len_`)
- `max_` is the maximum of `len_` and the previous value of `max_`
- `node` iterates from `0` to `n - 1`

### Loop Statement
```
for node in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
The loop variable `node` is iterating from `0` to `n - 1`. The current value of `node` at the end of the previous iteration is `n - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment of States
1. **Determine the Next Value of `node`:**
   - Since the loop variable `node` is iterating from `0` to `n - 1`, the next value of `node` will be `0` (because it starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration).

2. **Adjust Other Variables:**
   - `node1` remains unchanged as it was set to `n - 1` at the start of the loop and is not modified within the loop.
   - `num1` remains unchanged as it was set to `nums[n - 1]` at the start of the loop and is not modified within the loop.
   - `lens` and `max_` remain unchanged as they were set based on the initial conditions and are not modified within the loop.
   - `graph` is updated based on the condition inside the loop, but since we are only looking at the state before the next iteration, we do not need to explicitly state changes to `graph`.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration
State: **`node1` is `n - 1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, for all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1` (`n - 1`); otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`; `lens` is a list containing one element (the value of `len_`); `max_` is the maximum of `len_` and the previous value of `max_`; `node` is `0`**

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`node1` is `n - 1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, for all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1` (`n - 1`); otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`; `lens` is a list containing one element (the value of `len_`); `max_` is the maximum of `len_` and the previous value of `max_`; `node` is `0`**
