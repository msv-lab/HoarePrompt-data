The code assigns the value at the index `node2` of the list `nums` to the variable `num2`. Before the assignment, `num2` had the value at the index `node1 + 2` of `nums`. After the assignment, `num2` will hold the new value from the list.

- The value of `num1` remains unchanged because it was not involved in the operation.
- The value of `node2` remains unchanged as it was not modified.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation.
- The value of `num2` changes to the value at the index `node2` of `nums`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `node2` is `node1 + 2`, `n` must be greater than `node1 + 2`, and `num2` is the value at index `node2` of `nums`.

Output State: **`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `node2` is `node1 + 2`, `n` must be greater than `node1 + 2`, and `num2` is the value at index `node2` of `nums`.**
