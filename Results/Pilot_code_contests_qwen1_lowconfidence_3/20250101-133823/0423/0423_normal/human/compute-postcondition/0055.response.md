To ensure the for loop can execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop and their initial values or conditions. Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `node1` is `n - 1`.
   - `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`.
   - For all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1` (`n - 1`). Otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`.
   - `lens` is an empty list.
   - `max_` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `node` from `0` to `n - 1`.

3. **Variables Involved in the Loop**:
   - The loop variable `node` will take each value from `0` to `n - 1`.
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute for each `node` in this range.

4. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `node` is within the range `[0, n - 1]`.
   - There are no explicit conditions given that would prevent the loop from executing based on the initial states provided.

5. **States to Adjust**:
   - Since the loop will always execute for each value of `node` in the range `[0, n - 1]`, we don't need to adjust any specific states related to the loop's condition.
   - However, to provide a complete state description, we include the initial values and ranges as specified.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`node1` is `n - 1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, for all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1` (`n - 1`). Otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`; `lens` is an empty list, `max_` is 0; `node` will iterate from `0` to `n - 1`**.
