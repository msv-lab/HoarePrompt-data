`num2` is assigned the value of `nums[node2]`. The values of `node1`, `n`, and `num1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `node1` is less than \( n \), `n` is greater than `node1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, `num2` is the value of `nums[node2]`.

Output State: **`node1` is less than \( n \), `n` is greater than `node1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, `num2` is the value of `nums[node2]`**
