The code `num1 = nums[node1]` assigns the value at index `node1` of the list `nums` to the variable `num1`. However, the initial state does not provide any specific values for `nums` or `node1`. Therefore, the only thing we can say is that `num1` is assigned the value from `nums` at the index `node1`.

Output State: **`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `total` is not relevant here**
