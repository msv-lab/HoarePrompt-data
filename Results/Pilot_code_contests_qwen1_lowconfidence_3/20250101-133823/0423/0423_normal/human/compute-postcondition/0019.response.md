Output State: **`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `node2` is the last index that was checked in the loop, `n` is greater than `node1` and `node2` is at most `n-1`, and for every `node2` such that `node1 + 1 <= node2 < n` and `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, `graph[node2]` contains `node1`; otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`**.

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Values**: The loop starts with `num1` being the value at `nums[node1]`.
2. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over `node2` starting from `node1 + 1` up to `n-1`. For each iteration:
   - `num2` is set to the value at `nums[node2]`.
   - If the condition `abs(num1 - num2) <= k` is satisfied, `node1` is added to `graph[node2]`.
3. **Final State**:
   - `num1` remains unchanged as it is only defined at the start and not altered within the loop.
   - `node2` will be the last index checked in the loop, which means `node2` will be at most `n-1`.
   - `graph[node2]` will contain `node1` if and only if there exists a `node2` such that `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`.

This final state covers all possible outcomes after the loop has finished executing, including cases where the loop might not execute at all due to `n` being too small.
