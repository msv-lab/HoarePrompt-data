`n` and `k` are assigned the values of the first two integers from the input split by a space, and the list `A` remains unchanged. The output state is: `N` and `K` are integers such that \(1 \leq N \leq 300,000\) and \(0 \leq K \leq 300,000\); `A` is a list of `N` integers such that \(0 \leq A_i \leq 300,000\) for each \(i\) in range 1 to `N`; `n` and `k` are the first two integers from the input split by a space.
