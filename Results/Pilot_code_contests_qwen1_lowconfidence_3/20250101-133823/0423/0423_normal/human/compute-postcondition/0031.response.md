According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `node2`. The loop will continue as long as `node2` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`.
- `num2` is the value at index `node1 + 1` of `nums` (since `node2` was set to `node1 + 1` in the previous iteration).
- `node1` is less than `n - 1`.
- `n` is greater than `node1 + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `node2` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value (`node1 + 1`), making it `node1 + 2`.
- The condition `node2 < n` must still hold true.

Given that `node1` is less than `n - 1` and `n` is greater than `node1 + 1`, the next value for `node2` will be `node1 + 2`, and this value must still be less than `n`.

State: **`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `num2` is the value at index `node1 + 2` of `nums`, `node1` is less than `n-1`, and `n` is greater than `node1 + 2`.**
