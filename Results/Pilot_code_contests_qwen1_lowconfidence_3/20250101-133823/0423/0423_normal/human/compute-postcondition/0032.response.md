The code assigns the value at index `node2` of `nums` to `num2`. Since `num2` was initially the value at index `node1 + 2` of `nums`, this assignment changes its value. The other variables (`num1`, `node1`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `num2` is the value at index `node2` of `nums`, `node1` is less than `n-1`, and `n` is greater than `node2`.**
