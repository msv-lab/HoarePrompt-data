The code `graph[node2].append(node1)` appends the value of `node1` to the list located at `graph[node2]`. Based on the initial state, `node2` is `node1 + 2`, and the preconditions state that `n` must be greater than `node1 + 2`.

After executing the code, the value at `graph[node2]` (which is `node1 + 2`) will include `node1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `node2` is `node1 + 2`, `n` must be greater than `node1 + 2`, and `num2` is the value at index `node2` of `nums`; `graph[node2]` includes `node1`.**
