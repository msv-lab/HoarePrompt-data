Output State: **`node1` is `n - 1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, for all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1` (`n - 1`). Otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization and Loop Structure**:
   - The loop iterates over pairs of nodes `(node1, node2)` where `node1` ranges from `0` to `n-2` and `node2` ranges from `node1 + 1` to `n-1`.
   - For each pair, it checks if the absolute difference between `nums[node1]` and `nums[node2]` is less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Execution Flow**:
   - Initially, when `node1` starts at `0`, it iterates through all subsequent nodes (`node2`) until `n-1`.
   - As the loop progresses, `node1` increases by one after each outer iteration.
   - Once `node1` reaches `n-2`, it becomes `n-1` in the next iteration, and `node2` starts from `n-1`.

3. **Final State**:
   - By the end of the loop, `node1` will be `n-1`.
   - For each `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n-1]` (which simplifies to `[n-1+1, n-1]` or `[n, n-1]`, effectively `[n-1]`), `graph[node2]` will contain `node1` (`n-1`) if the condition `abs(nums[node1] - nums[node2]) <= k` is met.
   - Otherwise, `graph[node2]` will not contain `node1`.

4. **No Further Iterations**:
   - Since `node1` starts from `0` and goes up to `n-2`, the loop will eventually terminate when `node1` reaches `n-1`. There are no more valid `node2` values to check after this point.

Thus, after all iterations, the final state of the variables is as described above.
