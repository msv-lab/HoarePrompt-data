The code `graph[node2].append(node1)` appends `node1` to the list at index `node2` in the `graph` dictionary. Given the initial state, `num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `num2` is the value at index `node2` of `nums`, `node1` is less than `n-1`, and `n` is greater than `node2`. The code does not affect the values of `num1`, `num2`, `node1`, or `n`. It only modifies the `graph` dictionary.

Output State: **`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `num2` is the value at index `node2` of `nums`, `node1` is less than `n-1`, `n` is greater than `node2`, and `graph[node2]` contains the additional element `node1`.**
