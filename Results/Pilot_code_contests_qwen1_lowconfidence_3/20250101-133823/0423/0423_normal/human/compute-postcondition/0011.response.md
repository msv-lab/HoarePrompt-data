Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Current States:**
   - `num1`: The value at index `node1` of `nums`.
   - `node2`: Initially set to `node1 + 1`.
   - `n`: Must be greater than `node1 + 1`.
   - `num2`: The value at index `node1 + 1` of `nums`.
   - `graph`: A dictionary where `graph[node2]` contains `[node1]` if the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `node2` from `node1 + 1` to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `node2` was set to `node1 + 1` initially, but it could have been incremented during the loop execution.
   - We need to find the new value of `node2` for the next iteration.

4. **Check the Loop Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `node2` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `node2` starts at `node1 + 1` and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `node2` would be `node2 + 1`.

5. **Update the States:**
   - `node2` will be `node1 + 2` (the next index to check).
   - `num2` will be the value at index `node1 + 2` of `nums`.
   - If the condition `abs(num1 - num2) <= k` is met, `graph[node2 + 1]` will contain `[node1]`.

6. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `num1` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
   - `node2` is updated to `node1 + 2`.
   - `n` remains the same as it must still be greater than `node1 + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `node2` is `node1 + 2`, `n` must be greater than `node1 + 2`, and `num2` is the value at index `node1 + 2` of `nums`.**
