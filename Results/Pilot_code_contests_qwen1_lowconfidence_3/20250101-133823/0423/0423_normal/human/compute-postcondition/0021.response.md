`num1` is assigned the value at index `node1` of `nums`. The value of `num1` was previously the value at index `previous_node1 + 1` of `nums`, and `node1` is now updated to this new value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `node2` is the last index that was checked in the loop, `n` is greater than `previous_node1 + 1` and `node2` is at most `n-1`**
