According to the given for loop, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `node1`, `node2`, and `n`. The loop iterates over `node2` starting from `node1 + 1` up to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration:

- `num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`.
- `num2` is the value at index `node2` of `nums`.
- `node2` is the last index that was checked in the loop.
- `node1` is less than `n-1`.
- `n` is greater than `node1 + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `node2` needs to be incremented by 1. Given that `node2` is the last index that was checked, `node2` should now be `node2 + 1`.

To determine if the loop can continue, we need to check the following conditions:
1. `node1` must still be less than `n-1`.
2. `n` must still be greater than `node1 + 1`.

If these conditions are met, the loop can execute again with `node2` incremented by 1.

State: **`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `num2` is the value at index `node2 + 1` of `nums`, `node2` is the last index that was checked in the loop (now `node2 + 1`), `node1` is less than `n-1`, `n` is greater than `node1 + 1`**.
