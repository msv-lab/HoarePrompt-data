Postcondition: ***`node1` is `n - 1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, for all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1` (`n - 1`). Otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`; `lens` is an empty list, `max_` is 0; `node` iterates from `0` to `n - 1`. The current value of `node` either satisfies `len(graph[node]) == 0` (in which case `len_` is 1) or `len_` is the maximum length among the lengths of paths starting from each node in `graph` plus 1.***
