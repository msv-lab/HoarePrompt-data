Postcondition: ***`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `node2` is `node1 + 1`, `n` must be greater than `node1 + 1`, and `num2` is the value at index `node1 + 1` of `nums`; if the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`, then the graph dictionary now has `graph[node2]` containing `[node1]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the graph dictionary.***
