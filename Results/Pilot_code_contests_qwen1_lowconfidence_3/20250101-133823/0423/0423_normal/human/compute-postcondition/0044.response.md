The code `num2 = nums[node2]` assigns the value of `nums[node2]` to `num2`. The previous value of `num2` was `nums[node1 + 2]`, so `num2` is now updated to `nums[node2]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `node1` is less than \( n \), `n` is greater than `node1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, `num2` is the value of `nums[node2]`.

Output State: **`node1` is less than \( n \), `n` is greater than `node1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, `num2` is the value of `nums[node2]`**
