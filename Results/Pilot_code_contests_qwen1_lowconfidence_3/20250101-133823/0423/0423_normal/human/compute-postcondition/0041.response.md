`graph[node2]` is updated by appending `node1` to it. This changes the value of `graph[node2]` from its previous state (which was unspecified in the initial state but assumed to be a list) to a list containing `node1`. The other variables (`node1`, `n`, `num1`, `num2`, and the condition involving `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`node1` is less than \( n \), `n` is greater than `node1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, `num2` is the value of `nums[node2]`, and the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to \( k \); `graph[node2]` contains `node1`**
