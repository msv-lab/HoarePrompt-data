The code snippet `max_ = max(len_, max_)` updates the value of `max_` to be the maximum of the current value of `len_` and the previous value of `max_`. Since `len_` is the maximum length of paths starting from each node plus 1, and `max_` was initialized to 0, `max_` now holds the maximum length found so far.

The other variables and their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`node1` is `n - 1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, for all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1` (`n - 1`); otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`; `lens` is a list containing one element (the value of `len_`); `max_` is the maximum of `len_` and the previous value of `max_`; `node` iterates from `0` to `n - 1`.**
