Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `node1` is less than \( n \)
   - `n` is greater than `node1`
   - `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`
   - `num2` is the value of `nums[node2]`
   - If the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to \( k \), then `graph[node2]` contains `node1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `node2` from `node1 + 1` to `n-1`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `node2` was the last value it iterated over in the previous loop.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `node2` needs to be incremented by 1, so the new value of `node2` will be `previous_node2 + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `node2` should still be less than `n`.

5. **Updating the States:**
   - Since `node2` was previously `node1 + 1` up to some point, for the next iteration, `node2` will now be `node1 + 2`.
   - `num2` will now be `nums[node2]`, which means `num2` is the value of `nums[node1 + 2]`.

6. **Maintaining Other Variables:**
   - `node1` remains unchanged as the loop condition is based on `node2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `num1` remains the same as it is derived from `nums[n - 1]`.

7. **Final States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `node1` is still less than \( n \).
   - `n` is still greater than `node1`.
   - `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`.
   - `num2` is now the value of `nums[node1 + 2]`.

So, the updated states for the next iteration of the loop are:

State: **`node1` is less than \( n \), `n` is greater than `node1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, `num2` is the value of `nums[node1 + 2]`**
