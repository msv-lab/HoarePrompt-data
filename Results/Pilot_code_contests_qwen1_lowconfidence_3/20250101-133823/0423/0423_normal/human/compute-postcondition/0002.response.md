The code `nums = [int(input()) for i in range(n)]` reads `n` integers from input and stores them in a list named `nums`. The variables `N`, `K`, `A`, `n`, and `k` are not directly affected by this operation. The initial values of `A`, `N`, and `K` remain unchanged.

After executing the given code snippet:
- `n` and `k` are already defined as the first two integers from the input, so they remain the same.
- `nums` is now a list containing `n` integers, each read from the input.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` and `K` are integers such that \(1 \leq N \leq 300,000\) and \(0 \leq K \leq 300,000\); `A` is a list of `N` integers such that \(0 \leq A_i \leq 300,000\) for each \(i\) in range 1 to `N`; `n` and `k` are the first two integers from the input split by a space; `nums` is a list of `n` integers read from input.**
