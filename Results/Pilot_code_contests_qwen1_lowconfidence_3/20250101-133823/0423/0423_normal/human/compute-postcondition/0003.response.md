The code initializes a graph represented as a list of empty lists. The length of this list is `n`, which is the first integer from the input. The previous values of `N`, `K`, `A`, `n`, and `k` are not affected, and `nums` remains unchanged.

The output state is:
- `N` and `K` are integers such that \(1 \leq N \leq 300,000\) and \(0 \leq K \leq 300,000\)
- `A` is a list of `N` integers such that \(0 \leq A_i \leq 300,000\) for each \(i\) in range 1 to `N`
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `k` is the second integer from the input
- `nums` is a list of `n` integers read from input
- `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists

Output State: **`N` and `K` are integers such that \(1 \leq N \leq 300,000\) and \(0 \leq K \leq 300,000\); `A` is a list of `N` integers such that \(0 \leq A_i \leq 300,000\) for each \(i\) in range 1 to `N`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `nums` is a list of `n` integers read from input; `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists**
