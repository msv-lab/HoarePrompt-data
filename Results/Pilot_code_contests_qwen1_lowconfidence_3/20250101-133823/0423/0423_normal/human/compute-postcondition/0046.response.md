Postcondition: ***`node1` is less than \( n \), `n` is greater than `node1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, `num2` is the value of `nums[node2]`. If \(|num1 - num2| \leq k\), then `graph[node2]` now includes `node1`. There is no change in `node1`, `n`, `num1`, `num2`, and `graph[node2]` if \(|num1 - num2| > k\).***
