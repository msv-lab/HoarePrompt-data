Output State: **`node1` is `n - 1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, for all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) > k`, then `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`; otherwise, `graph[node2]` contains `node1`; `lens` is an empty list, `max_` is 0; `node` will iterate from `0` to `n - 1`, `len_` is the maximum length among the lengths of paths starting from each node in `graph` plus 1.**

The code updates the variable `len_` to be the maximum length of paths starting from each node in `graph` plus 1, but it does not specify which node's path length is being updated or what the exact value of `len_` is. Therefore, we can only say that `len_` is set to this value without knowing its exact numeric value unless additional context or specific values for the graph are provided.
