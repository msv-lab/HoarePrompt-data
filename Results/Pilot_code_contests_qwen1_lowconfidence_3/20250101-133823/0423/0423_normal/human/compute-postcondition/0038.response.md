State before the loop starts: `node1` is \( n - 1 \), `n` is the same as the previous iteration, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`

Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Variable `node1`:**
   - The loop starts with `node2 = node1 + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `node1 + 1` must be less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - Since `n` is the same as the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `node1` to allow the loop to start.

3. **Variable `num1`:**
   - This variable is not directly involved in the loop condition but may be used within the loop body. Its value does not affect whether the loop can start.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can start. Specifically, `node1` must be less than `n - 1` (since `node2` starts from `node1 + 1`).

State: **`node1` is less than \( n \), `n` is greater than `node1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`**
