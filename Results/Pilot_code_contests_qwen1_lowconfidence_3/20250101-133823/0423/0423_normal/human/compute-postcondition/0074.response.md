The code snippet updates the value of `max_` by taking the maximum of `len_` and the previous value of `max_`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `len_` and `max_`, we need to consider the possible scenarios.

Let's assume the initial state of `lens` is `[1, len_ + 1]` (or `[len_ + 1, 1]`), depending on the if condition. After appending `len_` to `lens`, the list `lens` becomes `[1, len_ + 1, len_]` (or `[len_ + 1, 1, len_]`).

The code snippet then updates `max_` to be the maximum of `len_` and the previous value of `max_`. We need to consider two cases:

1. If `max_` was less than `len_`, then `max_` is updated to `len_`.
2. If `max_` was already greater than or equal to `len_`, then `max_` remains unchanged.

Since the exact value of `max_` before this operation is not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `max_` without knowing its initial value. However, we know that `max_` will be at least `len_`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:
- `lens` is `[1, len_ + 1, len_]` (or `[len_ + 1, 1, len_]`).
- `max_` is at least `len_`.

Output State: **`lens` is `[1, len_ + 1, len_]` (or `[len_ + 1, 1, len_]`), `max_` is at least `len_`**
