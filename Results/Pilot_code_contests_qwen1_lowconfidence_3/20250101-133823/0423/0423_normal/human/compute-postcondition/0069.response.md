Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State After Previous Iteration:**
   - `node` is `0`.
   - `node1` is `n - 1`.
   - `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`.
   - For all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1` (`n - 1`); otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`.
   - `lens` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `len_`.
   - `max_` is the maximum of `len_` and the previous value of `max_`.
   - `node` is `0`.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `node` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `node` is `0`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `node` will be incremented by 1, so `node` will become `1`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - `node` will be `1`.
   - The values of `node1`, `num1`, `lens`, and `max_` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop based on the given information.
   - The condition for `graph[node2]` will be checked again for the new `node`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`node1` is `n - 1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, for all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1` (`n - 1`); otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`; `lens` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `len_`; `max_` is the maximum of `len_` and the previous value of `max_`; `node` is `1`.**
