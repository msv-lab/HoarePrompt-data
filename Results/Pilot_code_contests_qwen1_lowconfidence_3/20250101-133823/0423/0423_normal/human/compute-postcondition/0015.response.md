Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`.
- `num2` is the value at index `node2` of `nums`.
- `node2` is `node1 + 2`.
- If the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`, then `graph[node2]` includes `node1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the graph.

### For Loop:
```
for node2 in range(node1 + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current Values**:
   - `node2` starts from `node1 + 1` and goes up to `n-1`.

2. **Previous Iteration**:
   - Suppose the previous iteration had completed with `node2 = current_node2_value` (where `current_node2_value` is some value within the range).

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `node2` will be incremented by 1, making it `current_node2_value + 1`.

4. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `node2` is less than `n`.

5. **State Adjustments**:
   - `node2` will be updated to `current_node2_value + 1`.
   - `num1` and `num2` will be updated based on the new `node2` value:
     - `num1` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
     - `num2` is now the value at the new index `node2` (which is `current_node2_value + 1`).

### Final State:
- `num1` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
- `num2` is now the value at index `node2 + 1` (i.e., `node1 + 3`).
- `node2` is updated to `node2 + 1`.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
State: **`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `num2` is the value at index `node2 + 1` of `nums`, and `node2` is `node1 + 3`**
