The code snippet appends the value of `len_` to the list `lens`. According to the initial state, `lens` is a list containing two elements, both equal to either `1` or `len_ + 1` depending on the if condition. After appending `len_` to `lens`, the list `lens` will now contain three elements, where the third element is `len_`.

Output State: **`node1` is `n - 1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, for all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1` (`n - 1`); otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`; `lens` is a list containing three elements, the first two are either `1` or `len_ + 1` depending on the if condition, and the third element is `len_`; `max_` is the maximum of `1` or `len_ + 1` and the previous value of `max_`; `node` is `1`.
