According to the given code, the loop will execute as long as `node2` is within the specified range. The loop starts from `node1 + 1` and goes up to but does not include `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `node1` is less than \( n \)
- `n` is greater than `node1`
- `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`
- `num2` is the value of `nums[node2]`
- If \( |num1 - num2| \leq k \), then `graph[node2]` now includes `node1`.
- If \( |num1 - num2| > k \), there is no change in `node1`, `n`, `num1`, `num2`, and `graph[node2]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that the next value of `node2` (which would be `node1 + 2`) falls within the range defined by `node1 + 1` to `n - 1`.

Since `node2` was previously `node1 + 1`, the next value of `node2` should be `node1 + 2` to enter the next iteration.

State: **`node1` is less than \( n \), `n` is greater than \( node1 \), `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, `num2` is the value of `nums[node1 + 2]`**
