The code appends `node1` to the list at index `node2` in the `graph` dictionary. The value of `node2` is `node1 + 3`. Before the code execution, `num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `num2` is the value at index `node1 + 3` of `nums`, and `node2` is `node1 + 3`. After executing the code, the list at index `node2` in the `graph` dictionary will include `node1`.

Output State: **`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `num2` is the value at index `node1 + 3` of `nums`, and `node2` is `node1 + 3`; `graph[node2]` includes `node1`**
