Postcondition: ***`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `num2` is the value at index `node2` of `nums`, `node2` is the last index that was checked in the loop, `node1` is less than `n-1`, `n` is greater than `node1 + 1`. If the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`, `graph[node2]` includes `node1`. Otherwise, no change is made to the graph.***
