Let's analyze the loop and determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `node1` is \( n - 1 \)
   - `n` is the same as the previous iteration
   - `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`

2. **Loop Code:**
   ```python
   for node2 in range(node1 + 1, n):
       num2 = nums[node2]
       if abs(num1 - num2) <= k:
           graph[node2].append(node1)
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `node2` starting from `node1 + 1` up to `n - 1`.
   - For each `node2`, `num2` is set to `nums[node2]`.
   - If the condition `abs(num1 - num2) <= k` is met, `node1` is added to the adjacency list `graph[node2]`.

4. **Output State After Some Number of Iterations:**
   - We know that after each iteration, `node1` remains unchanged unless the loop stops early.
   - The condition `abs(num1 - num2) <= k` determines whether `node1` is added to `graph[node2]`.

5. **Final State:**
   - The loop will continue until `node2` reaches `n - 1`.
   - By the end of the loop, `node1` will still be `n - 1` because the loop does not change its value.
   - `num1` will still be `nums[n - 1]` because the loop does not change its value either.
   - `graph[node2]` will contain `node1` (i.e., `n - 1`) for all `node2` where the condition `abs(num1 - num2) <= k` was satisfied.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations of the loop, the values of the variables will be as follows:
- `node1` will be `n - 1`
- `num1` will be `nums[n - 1]`
- `graph[node2]` will include `node1` (i.e., `n - 1`) for all `node2` where the condition `abs(num1 - num2) <= k` was satisfied.

### Output State:
Output State: **`node1` is `n - 1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, for all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1` (`n - 1`).**
