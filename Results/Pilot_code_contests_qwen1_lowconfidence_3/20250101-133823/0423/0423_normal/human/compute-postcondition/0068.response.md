The code snippet `max_ = max(len_, max_)` updates `max_` to be the maximum of its current value and `len_`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `len_` is appended to `lens`, `lens` now contains two elements, both equal to `len_`. The `max_` variable is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `len_`.

Output State: **`node1` is `n - 1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, for all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1` (`n - 1`); otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`; `lens` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `len_`; `max_` is the maximum of `len_` and the previous value of `max_`; `node` is `0`.
