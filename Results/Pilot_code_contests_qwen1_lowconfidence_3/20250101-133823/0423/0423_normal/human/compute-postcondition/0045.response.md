The code `graph[node2].append(node1)` appends the value of `node1` to the list `graph[node2]`. The values of `node1` and `n` are unchanged, and the value of `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, while the value of `num2` is the value of `nums[node2]`.

After executing the code, the graph structure is updated, but the specific values of `num1` and `num2` remain the same.

Output State: **`node1` is less than \( n \), `n` is greater than `node1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, `num2` is the value of `nums[node2]`, and `graph[node2]` now includes `node1`.**
