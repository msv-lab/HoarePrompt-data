Let's analyze the given loop and determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`.
- `node2` is the last index that was checked in the loop.
- `n` is greater than `previous_node1 + 1` and `node2` is at most `n-1`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for node2 in range(node1 + 1, n):
    num2 = nums[node2]
    if abs(num1 - num2) <= k:
        graph[node2].append(node1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `node2` from `node1 + 1` to `n-1`.
   - For each iteration, it checks if the absolute difference between `num1` (the value at `node1` in `nums`) and `num2` (the value at `node2` in `nums`) is less than or equal to `k`.
   - If the condition is met, it appends `node1` to the adjacency list `graph[node2]`.

2. **State After Loop Execution:**
   - After the loop completes, `node2` will be `n-1` because the loop stops at `n-1`.
   - The value of `num1` remains the same as it was initially.
   - The value of `num2` will be the value at `node2` in `nums`, which is `nums[n-1]`.
   - The value of `node1` remains the same as it was initially.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it was initially.
   - The `graph` structure will have updated based on the conditions inside the loop.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute at least once if `n > node1 + 1`, ensuring `node2` starts from `node1 + 1` and goes up to `n-1`.
   - If `n <= node1 + 1`, the loop will not execute.

### Final Output State:

- If the loop executes, `num1` remains the value at index `node1` of `nums`.
- `num2` will be the value at index `node2` of `nums`, which is `nums[n-1]`.
- `node1` remains the initial value of `node1`.
- `node2` will be `n-1`.
- `n` remains the same as the initial value of `n`.
- `graph` will contain the updated adjacency lists based on the loop's condition.

- If the loop does not execute, `num1`, `num2`, `node1`, `node2`, and `n` remain as their initial values. The `graph` structure will not be modified.

### Output State:
**Output State: **`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `num2` is the value at index `node2` of `nums` which is `nums[n-1]`, `node1` is the initial value of `node1`, `node2` is `n-1`, `n` is the initial value of `n`, and `graph` is updated based on the condition `abs(num1 - num2) <= k` for each iteration. If the loop does not execute, `graph` remains unchanged.**
