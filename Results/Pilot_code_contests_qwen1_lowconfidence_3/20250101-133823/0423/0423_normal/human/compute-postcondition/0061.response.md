The code snippet `lens.append(len_)` appends the value of `len_` to the list `lens`. However, the value of `len_` is determined by iterating through the nodes and finding the maximum length of paths starting from each node in `graph` plus 1. Since the exact value of `len_` is not provided, we cannot specify its exact value here. Nonetheless, the list `lens` is updated with the value of `len_`.

Output State: **`node1` is `n - 1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, for all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1` (`n - 1`); otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`; `lens` is a list containing one element (the value of `len_`); `max_` is 0; `node` iterates from `0` to `n - 1`.
