State: **`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `node2` is the last index that was checked in the loop, `node1` is less than `n-1`, `n` is greater than `node1 + 1`, and `node2` is at most `n-1`**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `node2`:**
   - The loop starts with `node2` set to `node1 + 1`.
   - Therefore, the initial state of `node2` should be `node1 + 1`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `node2 < n`.
   - Given the condition `n > previous_node1 + 1`, and since `previous_node1` is implicitly `node1` (the variable name suggests this), we can use `n > node1 + 1` as the condition.

3. **Range of `node2`:**
   - The loop runs from `node1 + 1` to `n-1`.
   - Thus, `node2` must be at most `n-1`.

4. **Final State of `node2`:**
   - Since `node2` is incremented in each iteration, the final state of `node2` after the loop ends will be the last index that was checked, which is `n-1` if the loop completes its iterations fully.

5. **Initial State of `node2`:**
   - The initial state of `node2` before the loop starts is `node1 + 1`.

6. **Other Variables:**
   - `num1` is already correctly described as the value at index `node1` of `nums`.
   - `n` is greater than `node1 + 1` as given.
   - `node2` is at most `n-1` as required.

By ensuring these conditions, the loop can execute as intended.
