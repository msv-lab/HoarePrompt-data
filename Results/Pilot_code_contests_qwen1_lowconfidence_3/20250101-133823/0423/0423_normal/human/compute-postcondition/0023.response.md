`num2` is assigned the value at index `node2` of `nums`. The previous values of the variables are as follows: `num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `node2` is the last index that was checked in the loop, `node1` is less than `n-1`, `n` is greater than `node1 + 1`, and `node2` is at most `n-1`. After executing the code, the value of `num2` is updated, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `num2` is the value at index `node2` of `nums`, `node2` is the last index that was checked in the loop, `node1` is less than `n-1`, `n` is greater than `node1 + 1`**
