To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop structure.

### Given Conditions:
- `num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`.
- `node2` is the last index that was checked in the loop.
- `n` is greater than `node1` and `node2` is at most `n-1`.
- For every `node2` such that `node1 + 1 <= node2 < n` and `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, `graph[node2]` contains `node1`; otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`.

### Loop Structure:
```python
for node1 in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Condition**: The loop iterates over `node1` from `0` to `n-2` (since `range(n - 1)` includes indices from `0` to `n-2`).
2. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`.
   - `node2` is the last index that was checked in the loop.
   - `n` is greater than `node1` and `node2` is at most `n-1`.

### Next Iteration:
- After the previous iteration, `node1` would be `previous_node1` (the current `node1` before incrementing).
- `node2` is the last index that was checked in the loop during the previous iteration.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `node1` needs to be incremented by 1.
- Therefore, `node1` becomes `previous_node1 + 1`.
- `node2` remains the same as it is updated within the loop based on the condition and does not get updated immediately before the next iteration starts.
- `n` remains the same since it is an external constant or variable not modified within the loop.

### Updated States:
- `num1` is now the value at the new `node1` (which is `previous_node1 + 1`).
- `node2` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
- `n` remains greater than the new `node1` (now `previous_node1 + 1`).

### Conclusion:
State: **`num1` is the value at index `previous_node1 + 1` of `nums`, `node2` is the last index that was checked in the loop, `n` is greater than `previous_node1 + 1` and `node2` is at most `n-1`**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`num1` is the value at index `previous_node1 + 1` of `nums`, `node2` is the last index that was checked in the loop, `n` is greater than `previous_node1 + 1` and `node2` is at most `n-1`**.
