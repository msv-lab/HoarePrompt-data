`num1` is assigned the value of `nums[node1]`. The value of `node1` is \( n - 1 \), and `n` remains the same as the previous iteration. Therefore, `num1` will take the value from the list `nums` at index \( n - 1 \). The state of `node1` and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`node1` is \( n - 1 \), `n` is the same as the previous iteration, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`**
