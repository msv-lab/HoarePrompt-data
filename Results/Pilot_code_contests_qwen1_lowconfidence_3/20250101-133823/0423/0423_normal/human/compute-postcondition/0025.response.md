`graph[node2]` is updated to include `node1` in its list. The value of `node2` is the last index that was checked in the loop, and the relationship between `node1` and `n` remains unchanged. The absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is still less than or equal to `k`. 

Output State: **`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `num2` is the value at index `node2` of `nums`, `node2` is the last index that was checked in the loop, `node1` is less than `n-1`, `n` is greater than `node1 + 1`, and the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`; `graph[node2]` includes `node1`.**
