Output State: **`node1` is `n - 1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, for all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1` (`n - 1`); otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`; `lens` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being the length of the longest path starting from that node; `max_` is the maximum length of any path found during the loop execution; `node` iterates from `0` to `n - 1`.**
