Postcondition: **`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `num2` is the value at index `node2` of `nums`, and `node2` is `node1 + 2`. If the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`, then `graph[node2]` includes `node1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the graph.**
