Let's break down the given scenario step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop**: The loop involves `node2` and `node1` from the `nums` list, as well as `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of `node2` starting from `node1 + 1` up to but not including `n`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `node2`**:
   - Since `node2` starts iterating from `node1 + 1`, the initial value of `node2` should be `node1 + 1`.

4. **Check the Termination Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `node2 < n`. Therefore, `node2` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider the Length of `nums`**:
   - Since `node2` ranges up to `n`, `n` must be greater than `node1 + 1` for the loop to have elements to iterate over.

6. **Initial State of Other Variables**:
   - `num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`.
   - `total` is not relevant for the loop execution.

Based on the above analysis, we need to adjust the following states for the loop to execute:

- `node2` should be `node1 + 1` initially.
- `n` must be greater than `node1 + 1`.

Therefore, the final state before the loop execution is:

State: **`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `node2` is `node1 + 1`, `n` must be greater than `node1 + 1`**
