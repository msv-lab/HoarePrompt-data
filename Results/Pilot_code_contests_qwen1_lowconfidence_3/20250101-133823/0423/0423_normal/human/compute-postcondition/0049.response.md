The code appends `node1` to the list `graph[node2]`. The values of `node1` and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `num1` remains the value of `nums[n - 1]`, and the value of `num2` remains the value of `nums[node2]`.

After executing the code, the relationship between `node1` and `node2` in the graph structure is updated. Specifically, `node1` is added to the adjacency list of `node2`.

Output State: **`node1` is less than \( n \), `n` is greater than \( node1 \), `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, `num2` is the value of `nums[node2]`, and `graph[node2]` now includes `node1`.**
