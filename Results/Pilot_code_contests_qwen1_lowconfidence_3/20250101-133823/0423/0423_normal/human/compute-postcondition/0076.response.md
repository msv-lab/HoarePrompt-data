The code `print(max_)` simply prints the value of `max_`, which was determined during the loop execution. The loop iterates over nodes and updates the graph and lens lists based on the condition `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`. However, since no new assignments or changes to variables are made within the print statement itself, the only thing that happens is the printing of `max_`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the value of `max_` as it was computed before the print statement was executed. All other variables remain in their respective states.

Output State: **`node1` is `n - 1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, for all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1` (`n - 1`); otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`; `lens` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being the length of the longest path starting from that node; `max_` is printed; `node` iterates from `0` to `n - 1`.**
