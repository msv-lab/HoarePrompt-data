The code assigns the value at the index `node2` of `nums` to `num2`. Before the assignment, `num2` was the value at index `node2 + 1` of `nums`. After the assignment, `num2` now holds the value at index `node2` of `nums`.

The other variables (`num1`, `node1`, `node2`, and `n`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`
- `num2` is now the value at index `node2` of `nums`
- `node1` is less than `n-1`
- `n` is greater than `node1 + 1`

Output State: **`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `num2` is the value at index `node2` of `nums`, `node1` is less than `n-1`, `n` is greater than `node1 + 1`**
