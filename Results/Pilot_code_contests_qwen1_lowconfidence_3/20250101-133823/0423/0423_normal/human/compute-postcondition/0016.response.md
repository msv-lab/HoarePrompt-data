The code updates the value of `num2` to be the value at the index `node2` in the list `nums`. Given the initial state, `num2` was initially the value at index `node2 + 1` of `nums`. Now, `num2` is updated to the value at index `node2`.

Since `node2` is defined as `node1 + 3`, the new value of `num2` is the value at index `node1 + 3` in the list `nums`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `num2` is the value at index `node1 + 3` of `nums`, and `node2` is `node1 + 3`**
