The code `graph[node2].append(node1)` appends `node1` to the list at index `node2` in the `graph` dictionary. Based on the initial state, the values of `node1`, `node2`, `num1`, and `num2` remain unchanged. The condition that the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k` also remains valid.

Output State: **`num1` is the value at index `node1` of `nums`, `node2` is `node1 + 1`, `n` must be greater than `node1 + 1`, and `num2` is the value at index `node1 + 1` of `nums`; the graph dictionary now has `graph[node2]` containing `[node1]`; the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`.**
