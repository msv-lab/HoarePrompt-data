You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a sequence A_1, A_2, ..., A_N and an integer K.

Print the maximum possible length of a sequence B that satisfies the following conditions:

* B is a (not necessarily continuous) subsequence of A.
* For each pair of adjacents elements of B, the absolute difference of the elements is at most K.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 300,000
* 0 \leq A_i \leq 300,000
* 0 \leq K \leq 300,000
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
A_1
A_2
:
A_N


Output

Print the answer.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are integers such that 1 <= N <= 300,000 and 0 <= K <= 300,000. A is a list of N integers such that 0 <= A_i <= 300,000 for each i in range 1 to N.
def func():
    input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    n, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = [int(input()) for i in range(n)]
    graph = [[] for i in range(n)]
    for node1 in range(n - 1):
        num1 = nums[node1]
        
        for node2 in range(node1 + 1, n):
            num2 = nums[node2]
            if abs(num1 - num2) <= k:
                graph[node2].append(node1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `node1` is `n - 1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, for all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1` (`n - 1`). Otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`.
    lens = []
    max_ = 0
    for node in range(n):
        if len(graph[node]) == 0:
            len_ = 1
        else:
            len_ = max([lens[kid] for kid in graph[node]]) + 1
        
        lens.append(len_)
        
        max_ = max(len_, max_)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `node1` is `n - 1`, `num1` is the value of `nums[n - 1]`, for all `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n - 1]`, if `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `node1` (`n - 1`); otherwise, `graph[node2]` does not contain `node1`; `lens` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being the length of the longest path starting from that node; `max_` is the maximum length of any path found during the loop execution; `node` iterates from `0` to `n - 1`.
    print(max_)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
