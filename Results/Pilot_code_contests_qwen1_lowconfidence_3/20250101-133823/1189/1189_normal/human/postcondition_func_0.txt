The function takes an \(H \times W\) grid represented by a matrix `a` where each element is either `#` or `.`. It also ensures that the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`. The function then creates two new grids, `red` and `blue`, where each row in these grids is transformed based on the original row. Specifically, for even-indexed rows, both `red` and `blue` have alternating `#` and `.` starting with `#` for `red` and `.` for `blue`. For odd-indexed rows, `red` and `blue` have alternating `#` and `.` starting with `#` for `red` and `.` for `blue`. If a row contains a `#`, both `red` and `blue` for that row are filled with `#`. After transformation, the function prints each row of `red` followed by each row of `blue`. This means the output consists of two sets of transformed rows, one set for `red` and one set for `blue`.
