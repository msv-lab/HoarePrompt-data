You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Snuke and Ciel went to a strange stationery store. Each of them got a transparent graph paper with H rows and W columns.

Snuke painted some of the cells red in his paper. Here, the cells painted red were 4-connected, that is, it was possible to traverse from any red cell to any other red cell, by moving to vertically or horizontally adjacent red cells only.

Ciel painted some of the cells blue in her paper. Here, the cells painted blue were 4-connected.

Afterwards, they precisely overlaid the two sheets in the same direction. Then, the intersection of the red cells and the blue cells appeared purple.

You are given a matrix of letters a_{ij} (1≤i≤H, 1≤j≤W) that describes the positions of the purple cells. If the cell at the i-th row and j-th column is purple, then a_{ij} is `#`, otherwise a_{ij} is `.`. Here, it is guaranteed that no outermost cell is purple. That is, if i=1, H or j = 1, W, then a_{ij} is `.`.

Find a pair of the set of the positions of the red cells and the blue cells that is consistent with the situation described. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Constraints

* 3≤H,W≤500
* a_{ij} is `#` or `.`.
* If i=1,H or j=1,W, then a_{ij} is `.`.
* At least one of a_{ij} is `#`.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


H W
a_{11}...a_{1W}
:
a_{H1}...a_{HW}


Output

Print a pair of the set of the positions of the red cells and the blue cells that is consistent with the situation, as follows:

* The first H lines should describe the positions of the red cells.
* The following 1 line should be empty.
* The following H lines should describe the positions of the blue cells.



The description of the positions of the red or blue cells should follow the format of the description of the positions of the purple cells.

Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    red = []
    blue = []
    for i in range(n):
        row = raw_input()
        r = ['#']
        b = ['.']
        for j in range(1, m - 1):
            if row[j] == '#':
                r.append('#')
                b.append('#')
            elif i % 2 == 0:
                r.append('#')
                b.append('.')
            else:
                r.append('.')
                b.append('#')
        r.append('.')
        b.append('#')
        red.append(''.join(r))
        blue.append(''.join(b))
    for r in red:
        print(r)
    for b in blue:
        print(b)


```
Output hints: The function takes an \(H \times W\) grid represented by a matrix `a` where each element is either `#` or `.`. It also ensures that the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`. The function then creates two new grids, `red` and `blue`, where each row in these grids is transformed based on the original row. Specifically, for even-indexed rows, both `red` and `blue` have alternating `#` and `.` starting with `#` for `red` and `.` for `blue`. For odd-indexed rows, `red` and `blue` have alternating `#` and `.` starting with `#` for `red` and `.` for `blue`. If a row contains a `#`, both `red` and `blue` for that row are filled with `#`. After transformation, the function prints each row of `red` followed by each row of `blue`. This means the output consists of two sets of transformed rows, one set for `red` and one set for `blue`.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
