The code `b = ['.']` assigns the list `['.']` to the variable `b`. This changes the value of `b`, but does not affect the values of `blue`, `i`, `n`, `row`, or `r`.

Output State: **`blue` list has a newly appended string, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2; `row` is a string input by the user, `r` is `['#']`, `b` is `['.']`**
