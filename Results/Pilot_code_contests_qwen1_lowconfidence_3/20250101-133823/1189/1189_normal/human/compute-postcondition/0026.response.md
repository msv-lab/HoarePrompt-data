The code appends `'#'` to the list `b`. Initially, `b` is an empty list. After appending `'#'`, `b` becomes `['#']`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), the matrix `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`, `n` is a positive integer, `red` is an empty list, `blue` is either `['#']` or `['.']`, `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()`, `r` is `['#', '#', '.']`, `j` is `2`, `b` is `['#']`, and `row[j]` is either `'#'` or `'. '` based on the if-else condition executed.**
