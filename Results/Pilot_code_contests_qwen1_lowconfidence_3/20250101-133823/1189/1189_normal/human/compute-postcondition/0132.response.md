The code `print(b)` does not modify any variables; it only prints the value of `b`. Since the initial state is that `blue` must have at least one element, the output of the print statement will be the first element of the list `blue`.

Output State: **`blue` is a list with at least one element, and the output of the program is the first element of `blue`.**
