The code appends a period (`'.'`) to the list `r`. Since no initial value for `r` is provided, it is safe to assume that `r` is initially an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, after executing `r.append('.')`, the list `r` will contain one element, which is `'.'`.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\), `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`, and `j` is in the range [1, W-1]; `a[row][j]` is not `#`; `i` is not even; `r` is a list containing one element `'.'`**
