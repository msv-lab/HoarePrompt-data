The code `print(b)` prints the value of `b`, which is the second element of the list `blue`. However, the value of `b` itself is not modified by this operation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`blue` is a list with at least two elements, `b` is the next element in the list, the value of `b` is printed**
