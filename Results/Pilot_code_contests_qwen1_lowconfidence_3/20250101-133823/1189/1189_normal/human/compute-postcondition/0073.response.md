The code snippet appends a `'.'` to the list `b`. Since `b` was not defined in the initial state, we can assume it was initialized as an empty list before this code snippet. The other variables (`H`, `W`, `a`, `m`, `j`, and `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\), `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`, `j` is in the range [3, W-1], `r` is a list containing `'#'`, `b` is a list containing `''`.**
