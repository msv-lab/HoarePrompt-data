`b` is appended with the value `'#'`. The value of `b` was initially an empty list, so now it contains `['#']`. The values of `H`, `W`, `a`, `n`, `red`, `blue`, `row`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\), the matrix `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `n` is a positive integer; `red` is an empty list; `blue` is either `['#']` or `['.']` depending on the value of `(j + 1) % 2`; `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()`; `r` is `['#']`; `b` is `['#']`.**
