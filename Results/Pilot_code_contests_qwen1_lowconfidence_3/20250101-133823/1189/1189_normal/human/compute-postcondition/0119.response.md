The code snippet appends a period ('.') to the list `r`. Since `r` was previously a list of length `m-1` with alternating characters `#` and '.', starting with '#', appending a '.' increases its length by 1. 

The condition `if row[j] is '#' for any j in the range 1 to m-2` and the conditions regarding `i % 2` do not affect the immediate change to the list `r` since they are not evaluated in this code snippet. Therefore, the only change is to the list `r`.

Output State: **`blue` list has a newly appended string, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `row` is a string input by the user, `m` is greater than 2, `r` is a list of length `m` with alternating characters `#` and '.', starting with `#`, and `b` is a list of the same length with alternating characters `.` and `#`, starting with `.`.**
