The code appends the string `'#'` to the list `r`. Since `r` is not defined in the initial state, we assume `r` is initialized as an empty list before this code snippet. The other variables (`H`, `W`, `a`, `m`, `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\), `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`, and `j` is in the range [2, W-2]; `r` is now a list containing `'#'`.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\), `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`, and `j` is in the range [2, W-2]; `r` is a list containing `'#'`**.
