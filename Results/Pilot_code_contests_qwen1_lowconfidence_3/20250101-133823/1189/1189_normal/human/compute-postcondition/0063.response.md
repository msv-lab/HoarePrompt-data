The code `r.append('#')` appends the character `#` to the list `r`. Since `r` was not previously defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty list before this operation. The values of the other variables (`H`, `W`, `a`, `m`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\), `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`, `j` is in the range [2, W-2], and `r` is a list containing the single element `'#'`**
