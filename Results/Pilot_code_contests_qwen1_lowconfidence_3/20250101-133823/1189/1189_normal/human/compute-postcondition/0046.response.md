The code `b = ['.']` updates the list `b` to contain a single element, which is `['.']`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\)
- `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\)
- `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.` 
- `n` is a positive integer
- `red` is a list containing two elements, where the first element is either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on whether `j` is even or odd, and the second element is `['.']`
- `blue` is a list containing two elements: the original element and the string `['#']`
- `row` is the input from `raw_input()`
- `r` is `['#']`
- `b` is now `['.']`
- `i` is `k + 1`

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\); `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\); `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `n` is a positive integer; `red` is a list containing two elements, where the first element is either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on whether `j` is even or odd, and the second element is `['.']`; `blue` is a list containing two elements: the original element and the string `['#']`; `row` is the input from `raw_input()`; `r` is `['#']`; `b` is `['.']`; `i` is `k + 1`**
