The code reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input and splits them using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n` and `m`. This affects the values of `n` and `m`, but the initial conditions for `H` and `W` remain unchanged, as well as the matrix `a` which is not modified by this code.

Output State: **H is an integer such that 3 ≤ H, W ≤ 500, W is an integer such that 3 ≤ H, W ≤ 500; the matrix `a` is a H × W grid where each element is either `#` or `.`; additionally, the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; the variables `n` and `m` are assigned integers read from the input; there is at least one `#` in the grid.**
