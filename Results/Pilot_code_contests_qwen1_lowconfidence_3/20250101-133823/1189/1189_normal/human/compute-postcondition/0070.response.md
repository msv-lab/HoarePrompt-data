The code appends a `'#'` to the list `r`. Initially, `r` is not defined, so it will be initialized to be a list containing a single `'#'`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new list `r`.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\), `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`, and `j` is in the range [3, W-1]; `r` is a list containing `'#'`.**
