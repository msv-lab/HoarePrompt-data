The code snippet `r.append('.')` appends a `'.'` to the list `r`. The initial state does not provide any specific value for `r`, so we assume `r` is an empty list initially.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. `r` is initially an empty list.
2. The code `r.append('.')` appends a `'.'` to `r`, making `r` now contain `[.]`.

Other variables remain unchanged: `H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\), `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`, and `j` is in the range [3, W-1].

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`r` is `[.]`, `H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\), `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`, and `j` is in the range [3, W-1]**.
