The code appends `'#'` to the list `b`. Since `b` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it was empty before this operation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is `[.]`, `H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\), `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`, `j` is in the range [3, W-1], `b` is `['#']`.**
