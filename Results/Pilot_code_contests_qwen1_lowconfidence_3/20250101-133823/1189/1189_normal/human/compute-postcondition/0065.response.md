The code `r.append('.')` appends a period (`.`) to the list `r`. However, the initial state does not mention any variable named `r`. Since `r` is not defined before this line of code, appending to `r` would raise an error. Given the context and the initial state provided, it seems like `r` might be a list that is not mentioned in the initial state. But based on the information given, we can only assume `r` is being appended to, and its initial state remains undefined.

Since the code modifies the variable `r` and no other variables are affected, the output state will reflect the change in `r`.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\), `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`, and `j` is in the range [2, W-2]; `r` is a list with one additional element which is `.`**
