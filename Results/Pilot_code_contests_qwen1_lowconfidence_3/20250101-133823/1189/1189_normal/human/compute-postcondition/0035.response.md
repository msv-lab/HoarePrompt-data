The code `b.append('#')` adds the value `'#'` to the list `b`. Since the initial state does not mention `b`, we assume it was initialized as an empty list before this code was run. Therefore, after running the code, `b` will contain the single element `'#'`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state provided.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\); `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\); the matrix `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `n` is a positive integer; `red` is a list containing one element `'.'`; `blue` is either `['#']` or `['.']` depending on the value of \((j + 1) \% 2\); `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()`; `b` is a list containing one element `'#'`.**
