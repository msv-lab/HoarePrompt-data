The code `b.append('#')` appends the string `'#'` to the list `b`. Since `b` was initially a list with a newly appended string (let's denote this initial string as `initial_string`), after appending `'#'`, the list `b` will contain `initial_string` followed by `'#'`.

Other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`blue` list is `[initial_string, '#']`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `row` is a string input by the user, `m` is greater than 4, `j` is 4, `r` is the original list with an additional `'.'` appended to it.**
