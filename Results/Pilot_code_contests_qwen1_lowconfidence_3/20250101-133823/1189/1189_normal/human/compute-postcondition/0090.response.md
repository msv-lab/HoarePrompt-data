`b` is appended with `'#'`. The initial value of `b` is `['.']`, so after appending, `b` becomes `['.', '#']`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `blue` list has a newly appended string, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `row` is a string input by the user, `r` is `['#', '#']`, `b` is `['.', '#']`, `m` must be greater than 1, the current value of `row[j]` is `'#'`.
