The code appends `'#'` to the list `b`. Since `b` was not mentioned in the initial state and no other operations were performed on it, `b` will now contain `['#']`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state:
- `H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\)
- `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\)
- The matrix `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.` 
- `n` is a positive integer
- `red` is a list containing one element either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on whether `j` is even or odd
- `blue` is a list containing one element either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on whether `j` is even or odd
- `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()`
- `r` is a list containing one element `'.'`

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\); `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\); the matrix `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `n` is a positive integer; `red` is a list containing one element either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on whether `j` is even or odd; `blue` is a list containing one element either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on whether `j` is even or odd; `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()`; `r` is a list containing one element `'.'`; `b` is `['#']`**
