Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\), `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`, `j` is in the range [1, W-1]; `i` is `k + 1`; `r` is a list of length `m-1` filled with alternating `'#'` and `'.'`, starting with `'#'` if `i` is even, and ending with `'.'` if `i` is odd; `b` is a list of length `m-1` filled with alternating `'#'` and `'.'`, starting with `'.'` if `i` is even, and ending with `'#'`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `W-1` (where `m = W`).
- The condition inside the loop depends on the value of `row[j]` and whether `i` is even or odd.
- If `row[j]` is `#`, both `r` and `b` append `#`.
- If `row[j]` is not `#` and `i` is even, `r` appends `#` and `b` appends `.`.
- If `row[j]` is not `#` and `i` is odd, `r` appends `.` and `b` appends `#`.

After executing the loop `W-1` times, `r` and `b` will each contain `m-1` elements, where the elements alternate between `#` and `.` based on the parity of `i`. Specifically, `r` starts with `#` if `i` is even and ends with `.` if `i` is odd, while `b` starts with `.` if `i` is even and ends with `#` if `i` is odd.
