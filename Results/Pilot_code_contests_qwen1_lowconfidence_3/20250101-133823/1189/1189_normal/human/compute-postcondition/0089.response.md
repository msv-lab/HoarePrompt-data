The code `r.append('#')` appends the string `'#'` to the list `r`. Given the initial state, the list `r` initially contains `['#']`. After appending `'#'` to `r`, the list `r` will now contain `['#', '#']`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`blue` list has a newly appended string, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `row` is a string input by the user, `r` is `['#', '#']`, `b` is `['.']`, `m` must be greater than 1, the current value of `row[j]` is `'#'`**
