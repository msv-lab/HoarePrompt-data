The code `b.append('#')` adds the character `#` to the list `b`. The initial state does not specify what `b` is, but since it is not mentioned that `b` exists initially, we assume it is initialized as an empty list. Therefore, after executing this line of code, `b` will contain the single element `#`.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\), `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`, and `j` is in the range [2, W-2]; `r` is a list containing `'#'`; `b` is a list containing `'#'`**
