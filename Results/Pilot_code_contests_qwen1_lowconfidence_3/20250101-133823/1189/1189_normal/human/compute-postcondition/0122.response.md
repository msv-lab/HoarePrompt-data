`blue` has a newly appended string, which is the joined version of the list `b`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the value of `blue` changes to include the joined string of `b`.

Output State: **`blue` is now `[''.join(b)]`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `row` is a string input by the user, `m` is greater than 2, `r` is a list of length `m` with alternating characters `#` and `.`, starting with `#`, `b` is a list of the same length with alternating characters `.` and `#`, starting with `.`, and the end of `b` has an additional `#`, and `red` is a list with its last element being the string `#'#.#...#.'` (where the number of `#` and `.` alternates and the length is `m`).**
