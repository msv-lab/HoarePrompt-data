The code appends `'#'` to the list `r`. The initial value of `r` is `['#']`. After appending `'#'`, the value of `r` becomes `['#', '#']`.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ H, W ≤ 500; `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ H, W ≤ 500; the matrix `a` is a H × W grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `n` being a positive integer, `red` is an empty list, `blue` is an empty list, `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()`, `r` is `['#', '#']`, `b` is `['.']`, `j` is 1, and the current value of `row[j]` is `#`.**
