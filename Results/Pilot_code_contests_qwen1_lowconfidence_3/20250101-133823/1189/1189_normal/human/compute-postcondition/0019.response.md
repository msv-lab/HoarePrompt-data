Postcondition: ***`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ H, W ≤ 500, `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ H, W ≤ 500, the matrix `a` is a H × W grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `n` being a positive integer, `red` is an empty list, `blue` is either `['#']` or `['.']` depending on the value of `j % 2`, `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()`, `r` is either `['#', '#']` or `['#', '.']` depending on the value of `j % 2`, `j` is `1`, and `row[j]` is either `'#'` or `'. '` based on the if-else condition executed.***
