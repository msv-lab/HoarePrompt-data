The code `r.append('#')` appends the string `'#'` to the list `r`. Since `r` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a new list being created and populated with the given condition.

The initial state includes:
- `H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\)
- `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\)
- `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`, and `j` is in the range [1, W-1], and the current value of `row[j]` is `#`

After executing the code `r.append('#')`, the list `r` is created and contains `'#'`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\); `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\); `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`; `j` is in the range [1, W-1]; the current value of `row[j]` is `#`; `r` is a list containing `'#'`**
