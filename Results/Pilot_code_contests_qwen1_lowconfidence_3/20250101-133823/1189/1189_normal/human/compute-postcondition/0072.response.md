The code appends `'#'` to the list `r`. Since `r` was not defined in the initial state, it implies that `r` is initialized as an empty list before this line of code. The values of `H`, `W`, `a`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\), `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`, `j` is in the range [3, W-1]; `r` is a list containing `'#'`.
