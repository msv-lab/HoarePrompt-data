Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\); `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\); `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to the number of rows in the grid; `red` is a list of strings where each string represents a transformed row based on the original row according to the rules described in the loop; `blue` is a list of strings where each string represents a transformed row based on the original row according to the rules described in the loop; `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()` for each iteration; `r` is a list of length `m` with alternating characters `#` and `.`, starting with `#`; `b` is a list of the same length with alternating characters `.` and `#`, starting with `.`; the end of `b` has an additional `#`.**
