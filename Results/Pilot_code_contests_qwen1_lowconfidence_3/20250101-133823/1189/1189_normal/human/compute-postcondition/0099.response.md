Postcondition: ***`blue` list has a newly appended string, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `row` is a string input by the user, `m` is greater than 1. If `row[j]` is `'#'`, then `r` is `['#', '#']` and `b` is `['.', '#']`. Otherwise, `r` is either `['#', '#']` or `['#', '.']` and `b` is either `['.', '#']` or `['.', '.']`, depending on whether `i % 2 == 0`.***
