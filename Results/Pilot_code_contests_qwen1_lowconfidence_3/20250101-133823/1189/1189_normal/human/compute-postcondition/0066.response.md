The code appends the string `'#'` to the list `b`. The initial state of `b` is a list with one additional element which is `.`. After appending `'#'`, the list `b` will have two elements: `.` and `'#'`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged:
- `H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\)
- `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\)
- `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; 
- `m` is equal to `W`, and `j` is in the range [2, W-2]
- `r` is a list with one additional element which is `.`

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\), `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`, and `j` is in the range [2, W-2]; `r` is a list with one additional element which is `.`; `b` is a list with two elements: `.` and `'#'`**
