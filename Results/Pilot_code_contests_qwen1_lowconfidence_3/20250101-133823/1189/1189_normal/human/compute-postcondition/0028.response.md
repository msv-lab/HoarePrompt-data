Postcondition: ***`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), the matrix `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `n` is a positive integer; `red` is an empty list; `blue` is either `['#']` or `['.']` depending on the value of `j % 2`; `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()`. If `row[j]` is `'#'`, `blue` becomes `['#']`, `r` becomes `['#', '.', '#']`, and `row[j]` remains `'#'`. Otherwise, `blue` becomes `['.']`, `r` becomes `['#', '#', '.']`, and `row[j]` remains `'.
