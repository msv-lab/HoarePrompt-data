The code `r.append('.')` appends a `'.'` to the list `r`. Since `r` is a list of length `m-1` filled with alternating `'#'` and `'.'`, starting with `'#'` if `i` is even, and ending with `'.'` if `i` is odd, the append operation will add a `'.'` to the end of this list.

Given that `i` is defined as `i = k + 1`, and the original list `r` was of length `m-1` (where `m` is equal to `W`), the new length of `r` will be `m`. 

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `r` now has a length of `m` and ends with `'.'`.
- All other elements in `r` remain the same as per the original alternating pattern starting with `'#'` if `i` is even, and ending with `'.'` if `i` is odd.

Since no other variables are affected by the given code, their states remain as per the initial state.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\), `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`, `j` is in the range [1, W-1]; `i` is `k + 1`; `r` is a list of length `m` filled with alternating `'#'` and `'.'`, starting with `'#'` if `i` is even, and ending with `'.'` if `i` is odd; `b` is a list of length `m-1` filled with alternating `'#'` and `'.'`, starting with `'.'` if `i` is even, and ending with `'#'`.**
