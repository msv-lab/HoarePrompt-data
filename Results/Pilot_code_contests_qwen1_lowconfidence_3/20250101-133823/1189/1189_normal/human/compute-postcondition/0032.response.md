The code appends the value `'#'` to the list `red`. The list `red` was initially empty, so now it contains `['#']`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq H \leq 500 \); `W` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq W \leq 500 \); the matrix `a` is an \( H \times W \) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `n` is a positive integer; `red` is `['#']`; `blue` is either `['#']` or `['.']` depending on the value of `(j + 1) % 2`; `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()`**
