`r` is a list that appends a `'.'` to itself. Initially, `r` is `['#']`. After executing `r.append('.')`, the list `r` becomes `['#', '.']`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `blue` list has a newly appended string, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `row` is a string input by the user, `r` is `['#', '.']`, `b` is `['.']`, `m` is greater than 1, and `row[j]` is equal to `'#'`.
