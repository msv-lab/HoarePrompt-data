Functionality: **The function takes an \(H \times W\) grid represented by a matrix `a` where each element is either `#` or `.`. It also ensures that the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`. The function then creates two new grids, `red` and `blue`, where each row in these grids is transformed based on the original row. Specifically, for even-indexed rows, both `red` and `blue` have alternating `#` and `.` starting with `#` for `red` and `.` for `blue`. For odd-indexed rows, `red` and `blue` have alternating `#` and `.` starting with `#` for `red` and `.` for `blue`. If a row contains a `#`, both `red` and `blue` for that row are filled with `#`. After transformation, the function prints each row of `red` followed by each row of `blue`. This means the output consists of two sets of transformed rows, one set for `red` and one set for `blue`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input grid is empty (which is not possible given the constraints), the function would behave unexpectedly.
- If the grid dimensions do not satisfy \(3 \leq H, W \leq 500\), the function will still operate within its defined behavior but will not generate valid output.
- If the grid does not contain any `#`, the function will still transform the rows according to the specified pattern but will only fill the rows with `#`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not validate whether the first and last rows and columns are indeed all `.` before processing. While the code enforces this condition during the transformation, it does not check the initial validity of the input grid.
