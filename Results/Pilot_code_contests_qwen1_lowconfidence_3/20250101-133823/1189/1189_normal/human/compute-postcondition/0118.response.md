Output State: **`blue` list has a newly appended string, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `row` is a string input by the user, `m` is greater than 2, `r` is a list of length `m-1` with alternating characters `#` and `.`, starting with `#`, and `b` is a list of the same length with alternating characters `.` and `#`, starting with `.`. If `row[j]` is `#` for any `j` in the range `1` to `m-2`, then `r` and `b` will contain additional `#` and `.` respectively. If `i % 2 == 0`, then `r` will have an additional `#` and `b` will have an additional `.`. If `i % 2 != 0`, then `r` will have an additional `.` and `b` will have an additional `#`.**
