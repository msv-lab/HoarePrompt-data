Let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Initial State Recap:**
   - `H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\)
   - `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\)
   - `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; 
   - `m` is equal to `W`
   - `j` is in the range [1, W-1]
   - `i` is `k + 1`
   - `r` is a list of length `W` filled with alternating `'#'` and `'.'`, starting with `'#'` if `i` is even, and ending with `'.'` if `i` is odd
   - `b` is a list of length `m` (which is `W`) filled with alternating `'#'` and `'.'`, starting with `'.'` if `i` is even, and ending with `'#'`
   - `red` is a list containing one additional element, which is the string representation of `r`

2. **Code Impact:**
   - The code `blue.append(''.join(b))` appends a new element to the list `blue`. This element is a string that results from joining all elements in the list `b`.

3. **Impact Calculation:**
   - Since `b` is a list of length `W` filled with alternating `'#'` and `'.'`, starting with `'.'` if `i` is even, and ending with `'#'`, the resulting string when joined will be a string of length `W` with the same alternating pattern as `b`.
   - The value of `blue` before this operation is undefined, but after this operation, `blue` will have this new string appended to it.

4. **Output State:**
   - The output state includes the updated `blue` list with the newly appended string.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\); `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\); `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`; `j` is in the range [1, W-1]; `i` is `k + 1`; `r` is a list of length `W` filled with alternating `'#'` and `'.'`, starting with `'#'` if `i` is even, and ending with `'.'` if `i` is odd; `b` is a list of length `W` filled with alternating `'#'` and `'.'`, starting with `'.'` if `i` is even, and ending with `'#'`; `red` is a list containing one additional element, which is the string representation of `r`; `blue` is a list with the newly appended string `''.join(b)`**
