`b` is a list that appends a new string `'.'` to its end. The initial state of `b` is either `['.', '#']` or `['.', '.']` depending on whether `i % 2 == 0`. Since `i` is 2, `i % 2 == 0` is true, so the initial state of `b` is `['.', '#']`. After appending `'.'` to `b`, the new state of `b` will be `['.', '#', '.']`.

The states of the other variables (`blue`, `i`, `n`, `row`, `m`, `j`, `r`) are not affected.

Output State: **`blue` list has a newly appended string, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `row` is a string input by the user, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 3, `r` is `['#', '#', '#']`, and `b` is `['.', '#', '.']`**
