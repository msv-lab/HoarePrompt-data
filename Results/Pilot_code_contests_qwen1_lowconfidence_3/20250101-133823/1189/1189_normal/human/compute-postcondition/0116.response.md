Postcondition: **`blue` list has a newly appended string. If `i` (which is 2) is even, `blue` list has a newly appended string `.` in addition to its original elements. Otherwise, `blue` list is `[initial_string, '#']`. Additionally, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `row` is a string input by the user, `m` is greater than 4, `j` is 4, and `r` is a list with an additional string `'#'` or `'.'` appended to it depending on the condition.**
