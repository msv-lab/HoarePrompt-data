The code snippet appends a `.` to the list `b`. Since `b` was not mentioned in the initial state, we can assume it was an empty list before this operation. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\); `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\); the matrix `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `n` is a positive integer; `red` is `['#']`; `blue` is either `['#']` or `['.']` depending on the value of `(j + 1) % 2`; `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()`; `b` is `['.']`.**
