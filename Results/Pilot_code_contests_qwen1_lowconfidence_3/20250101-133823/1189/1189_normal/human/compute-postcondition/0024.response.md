The code appends a `'.'` to the list `b`. The list `b` was initially empty, so now it contains one element `'.'`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `b`.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), the matrix `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`, `n` is a positive integer, `red` is an empty list, `blue` is either `['#']` or `['.']` depending on the value of `j % 2`, `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()`, `r` is `['#', '#', '#']`, `j` is `2`, `b` is `['.']`, and `row[j]` is either `'#'` or `'. '` based on the if-else condition executed.**
