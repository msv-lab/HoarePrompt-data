`b` is a list that appends the value `'#'`. The initial state shows that `b` is `['.']`. After running the code `b.append('#')`, the list `b` will contain both elements it initially had plus the new element `'#'`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`blue` list has a newly appended string, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `row` is a string input by the user, `r` is `['#', '.']`, `b` is `['.', '#']`, `m` is greater than 1, and `row[j]` is equal to `'#'`**
