The code appends a period (`'.'`) to the list `b`. Since `b` was not defined before, it is assumed to be an empty list. Therefore, after the code is executed, `b` will contain one element, which is `'.'`.

All other variables remain unchanged: `H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\), `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`, `j` is in the range [2, W-2], and `r` is a list containing the single element `'#'`.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\), `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`, `j` is in the range [2, W-2], `r` is a list containing the single element `'#'`, and `b` is a list containing the single element `'.'`.**
