The code `r.append('.')` appends a `'.'` to the list `r`. The list `r` was not mentioned in the initial state, so we assume it was empty before this line of code was executed. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `r` now contains a single element `'.'`.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\); `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\); the matrix `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `n` is a positive integer; `red` is a list containing one element either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on whether `j` is even or odd; `blue` is a list containing one element either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on whether `j` is even or odd; `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()`; `r` is a list containing one element `'.'`.**
