The code appends the value of `row` (which is stored in the list `r`) to the list `red`. Given that `r` contains `['.']`, this means `red` will now contain two elements: the original element based on whether `j` is even or odd, and the new element `['.']`.

The initial state is:
- `H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\)
- `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\)
- `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `red` is a list containing one element either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on whether `j` is even or odd.
- `blue` is a list containing one element either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on whether `j` is even or odd.
- `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()`.
- `r` is a list containing one element `'.'`.
- `b` is `['#']`.

After executing the code `red.append(''.join(r))`, `red` will have its original value plus `['.']`. Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:
- `H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\)
- `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\)
- `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `red` is a list containing two elements, where the first element is either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on whether `j` is even or odd, and the second element is `['.']`.
- `blue` is a list containing one element either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on whether `j` is even or odd.
- `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()`.
- `r` is a list containing one element `'.'`.
- `b` is `['#']`.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\); `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\); `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `n` is a positive integer; `red` is a list containing two elements, where the first element is either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on whether `j` is even or odd, and the second element is `['.']`; `blue` is a list containing one element either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on whether `j` is even or odd; `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()`; `r` is a list containing one element `'.'`; `b` is `['#']`**.
