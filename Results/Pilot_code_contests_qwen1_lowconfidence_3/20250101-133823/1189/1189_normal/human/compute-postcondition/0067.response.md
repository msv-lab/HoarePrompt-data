Postcondition: ***`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\), `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`, `j` is in the range [2, W-2]; if `i` is even, `r` is a list containing the single element `'#'` and `b` is a list containing the single element `'.'`. Otherwise, `r` is a list with one additional element which is `.` and `b` is a list with two elements: `.` and `'#'`***
