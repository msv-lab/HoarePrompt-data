The code `r.append('#')` appends the string `'#'` to the list `r`. Given the initial state, `r` is either `['#', '#']` or `['#', '.']` based on the value of `j % 2`, and `j` is `2`. Since `j` is `2`, `j % 2` is `0`, which means `r` is initially `['#', '.']`. After appending `'#'` to `r`, `r` becomes `['#', '.', '#']`.

The output state after executing the code is:
Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), the matrix `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`, `n` is a positive integer, `red` is an empty list, `blue` is either `['#']` or `['.']` depending on the value of `j % 2`, `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()`, `r` is `['#', '.', '#']`, `j` is `2`, and `row[j]` is either `'#'` or `'. '` based on the if-else condition executed.**
