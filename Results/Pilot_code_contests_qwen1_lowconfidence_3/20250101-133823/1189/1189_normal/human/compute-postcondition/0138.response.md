The function `func` accepts no parameters directly. However, it works with a matrix `a` which is a H × W grid where each element is either `#` or `.`. The constraints for H and W are that they are integers such that 3 ≤ H, W ≤ 500, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`. Additionally, there is at least one `#` in the grid.

Given the output description is not provided, we will focus on the input parameters and their constraints.
