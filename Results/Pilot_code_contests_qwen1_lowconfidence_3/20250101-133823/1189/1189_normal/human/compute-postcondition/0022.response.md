`b` is appended with the value `'#'`. The value of `j` is `2`, so the condition `if j % 2 == 0:` is true, making `blue` equal to `['#']`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are as follows:

- `H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\)
- `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\)
- `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`
- `n` is a positive integer
- `red` is an empty list
- `blue` is `['#']`
- `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()`
- `r` is `['#', '.', '#']`
- `j` is `2`
- `row[j]` is `'#'` (since `j % 2 == 0`)

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\); `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\); `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `n` is a positive integer; `red` is an empty list; `blue` is `['#']`; `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()`; `r` is `['#', '.', '#']`; `j` is `2`; `row[j]` is `'#'`**
