The code reads a single line of input using `raw_input()`. This line of input will be stored in the variable `row`. The other variables (`H`, `W`, `a`, `n`, `m`, `red`, `blue`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ H, W ≤ 500; `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ H, W ≤ 500; the matrix `a` is a H × W grid where each element is either `#` or `.`; additionally, the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; the variables `n` and `m` are assigned integers read from the input; `red` is an empty list; `blue` is an empty list; `n` must be a positive integer; `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()`**
