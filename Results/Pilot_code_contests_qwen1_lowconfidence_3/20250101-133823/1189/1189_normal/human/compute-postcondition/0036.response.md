Postcondition: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\); `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\); the matrix `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `n` is a positive integer; `red` is a list containing one element either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on whether `i` is even or odd; `blue` is either `['#']` or `['.']` depending on the value of \((j + 1) \% 2\); `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()`; `b` is a list containing one element either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on whether `i` is even or odd.**
