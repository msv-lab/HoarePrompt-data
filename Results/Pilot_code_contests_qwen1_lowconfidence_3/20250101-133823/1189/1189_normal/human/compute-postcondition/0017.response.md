The code appends `'#'` to the list `b`. The initial state includes that `b` is an empty list. After appending `'#'`, the list `b` will contain `'#'`.

- The first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `n` being a positive integer.
- `red` is an empty list.
- `blue` is an empty list.
- `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()`.
- `r` is `['#', '.']`.
- `b` is `['#']` (after the append operation).
- `j` is `1`.
- `row[j]` is not `'#'` and `(i % 2 != 0)`.

The output state remains the same for the variables that were not affected, and only the list `b` is updated.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ H, W ≤ 500; `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ H, W ≤ 500; the matrix `a` is a H × W grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `n` being a positive integer; `red` is an empty list; `blue` is `['#']`; `row` is a string representing the input from `raw_input()`; `r` is `['#', '.']`; `j` is `1`; `row[j]` is not `'#'` and `(i % 2 != 0)`**.
