Postcondition: ***`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\), `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`, and `j` is in the range [1, W-1]. If `row[j]` is `#`, `r` is a list containing `'#'` and `b` is a list containing `['#']`. Otherwise, `a[row][j]` is not `#`, if `i` is an even integer, `r` is `['#']` and `b` is `['.']`. Otherwise, `r` is a list containing one element `'.'` and `b` is a list containing one element `'#'`***
