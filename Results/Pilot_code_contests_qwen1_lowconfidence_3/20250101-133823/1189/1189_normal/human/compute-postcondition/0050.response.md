The code snippet `b.append('#')` appends the character `'#'` to the list `b`. Before the code executes, the list `b` is not mentioned in the initial state, so it must be an empty list initially. After appending `'#'` to `b`, the list `b` will contain `['#']`.

The states of the other variables (`H`, `W`, `a`, `m`, `j`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\); `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\); `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`; `j` is in the range [1, W-1]; the current value of `row[j]` is `#`; `r` is a list containing `'#'`; `b` is a list containing `['#']`**
