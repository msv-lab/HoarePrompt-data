The code snippet `b.append('#')` appends the value `'#'` to the list `b`. Let's analyze the initial state and the effect of this operation:

- `H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\).
- `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\).
- `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`.
- `m` is equal to `W`.
- `j` is in the range [1, W-1].
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `r` is a list of length `m` filled with alternating `'#'` and `'.'`, starting with `'#'` if `i` is even, and ending with `'.'` if `i` is odd.
- `b` is a list of length `m-1` filled with alternating `'#'` and `'.'`, starting with `'.'` if `i` is even, and ending with `'#'`.

Since `b` is a list of length `m-1` filled with alternating `'#'` and `'.'`, and the last element depends on the parity of `i`, appending `'#'` to `b` changes its contents.

If `i` is even, `b` originally ends with `'#'`, and after appending `'#'`, it ends with `'#'` and has one more element.
If `i` is odd, `b` originally ends with `'.'`, and after appending `'#'`, it ends with `'#'` and has one more element.

Therefore, regardless of the parity of `i`, the new list `b` will end with `'#'` and have one more element than before.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\), `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`, `j` is in the range [1, W-1]; `i` is `k + 1`; `r` is a list of length `m` filled with alternating `'#'` and `'.'`, starting with `'#'` if `i` is even, and ending with `'.'` if `i` is odd; `b` is a list of length `m` filled with alternating `'#'` and `'.'`, starting with `'.'` if `i` is even, and ending with `'#'`.**
