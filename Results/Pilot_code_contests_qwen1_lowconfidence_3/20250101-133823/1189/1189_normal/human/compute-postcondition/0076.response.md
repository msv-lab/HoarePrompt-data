Postcondition: ***`H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\), `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\), `a` is an \(H \times W\) grid where each element is either `#` or `.`, and the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid are all `.`; `m` is equal to `W`, `j` is in the range [3, W-1]; if `i` is even, `r` is `[.]` and `b` is `['#']`; otherwise, `r` is `[.]` and `b` is `['#']`.*** 

In this case, since the `if` and `else` blocks both result in `r` being `[.]` and `b` being `['#']`, the overall postcondition remains the same regardless of whether `i` is even or odd.
