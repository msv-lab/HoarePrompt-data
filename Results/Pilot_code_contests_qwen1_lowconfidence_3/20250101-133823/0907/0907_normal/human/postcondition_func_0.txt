The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `t1, t2, ..., tn`. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in the range from -10 to 10 within the list `t`. After counting, it calculates the sum of the products of the counts of each pair of opposites (e.g., the count of -3 and the count of 3) and adds half the square of the count of 0 to this sum. The final result is printed. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 0 (in which case no elements are read), or when the list `t` contains only zeros. Missing functionality in the annotations is the initialization of the dictionary `a` and the final summation steps, which are correctly reflected in the code.
