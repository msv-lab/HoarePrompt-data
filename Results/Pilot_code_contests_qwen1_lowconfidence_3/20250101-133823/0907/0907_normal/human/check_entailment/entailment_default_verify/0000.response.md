Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the provided problem description and the output hints, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** was due to the handling of the input integer `n`. However, after reviewing the program and the output hints, it appears that the original assessment might have been based on an incorrect understanding of the problem constraints. The output hints and the provided program logic correctly handle the reading of `n` as an integer and proceed to calculate the number of opposite couples as described in the problem statement. The program initializes the dictionary `a` to count occurrences of each integer in the range from -10 to 10 and then calculates the number of opposite couples accurately. Therefore, the original assessment was likely based on a misunderstanding, and the program is indeed correct.
