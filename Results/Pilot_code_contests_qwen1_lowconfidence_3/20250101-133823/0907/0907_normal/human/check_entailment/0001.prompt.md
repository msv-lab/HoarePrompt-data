You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Everybody knows that opposites attract. That is the key principle of the "Perfect Matching" dating agency. The "Perfect Matching" matchmakers have classified each registered customer by his interests and assigned to the i-th client number ti ( - 10 ≤ ti ≤ 10). Of course, one number can be assigned to any number of customers.

"Perfect Matching" wants to advertise its services and publish the number of opposite couples, that is, the couples who have opposite values of t. Each couple consists of exactly two clients. The customer can be included in a couple an arbitrary number of times. Help the agency and write the program that will find the sought number by the given sequence t1, t2, ..., tn. For example, if t = (1, - 1, 1, - 1), then any two elements ti and tj form a couple if i and j have different parity. Consequently, in this case the sought number equals 4.

Of course, a client can't form a couple with him/herself.

Input

The first line of the input data contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) which represents the number of registered clients of the "Couple Matching". The second line contains a sequence of integers t1, t2, ..., tn ( - 10 ≤ ti ≤ 10), ti — is the parameter of the i-th customer that has been assigned to the customer by the result of the analysis of his interests.

Output

Print the number of couples of customs with opposite t. The opposite number for x is number  - x (0 is opposite to itself). Couples that only differ in the clients' order are considered the same.

Note that the answer to the problem can be large enough, so you must use the 64-bit integer type for calculations. Please, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.

Examples

3

Note

In the first sample the couples of opposite clients are: (1,2), (1,5) и (3,4).

In the second sample any couple of clients is opposite.
Program:
```
def func():
    a = dict()
    for i in range(-10, 11):
        a[i] = 0
    n = input()
    t = map(int, raw_input().split())
    for i in range(n):
        a[t[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for i in range(-10, 0):
        ans += a[i] * a[-i]
    ans += a[0] * (a[0] - 1) / 2
    print(ans)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
