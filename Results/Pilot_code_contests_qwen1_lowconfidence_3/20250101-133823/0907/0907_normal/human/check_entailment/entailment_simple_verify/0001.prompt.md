You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Everybody knows that opposites attract. That is the key principle of the "Perfect Matching" dating agency. The "Perfect Matching" matchmakers have classified each registered customer by his interests and assigned to the i-th client number ti ( - 10 ≤ ti ≤ 10). Of course, one number can be assigned to any number of customers.

"Perfect Matching" wants to advertise its services and publish the number of opposite couples, that is, the couples who have opposite values of t. Each couple consists of exactly two clients. The customer can be included in a couple an arbitrary number of times. Help the agency and write the program that will find the sought number by the given sequence t1, t2, ..., tn. For example, if t = (1, - 1, 1, - 1), then any two elements ti and tj form a couple if i and j have different parity. Consequently, in this case the sought number equals 4.

Of course, a client can't form a couple with him/herself.

Input

The first line of the input data contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) which represents the number of registered clients of the "Couple Matching". The second line contains a sequence of integers t1, t2, ..., tn ( - 10 ≤ ti ≤ 10), ti — is the parameter of the i-th customer that has been assigned to the customer by the result of the analysis of his interests.

Output

Print the number of couples of customs with opposite t. The opposite number for x is number  - x (0 is opposite to itself). Couples that only differ in the clients' order are considered the same.

Note that the answer to the problem can be large enough, so you must use the 64-bit integer type for calculations. Please, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.

Examples

Input

5
-3 3 0 0 3


Output

Input

3
0 0 0


Output

3

Note

In the first sample the couples of opposite clients are: (1,2), (1,5) и (3,4).

In the second sample any couple of clients is opposite.
Program:
```
def func():
    a = dict()
    for i in range(-10, 11):
        a[i] = 0
    n = input()
    t = map(int, raw_input().split())
    for i in range(n):
        a[t[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for i in range(-10, 0):
        ans += a[i] * a[-i]
    ans += a[0] * (a[0] - 1) / 2
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly count all possible opposite couples. Specifically, it does not account for the case where `n` is not provided as an integer but rather as part of the list of integers. The program should read the number of clients `n` from the first line as an integer, but instead, it takes `n` as the length of the input list, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should modify the line:
```python
n = input()
```
to properly read the integer value of `n`:
```python
n = int(input())
```

Additionally, the program should handle the case where the input is read correctly as a list of integers. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    a = dict()
    for i in range(-10, 11):
        a[i] = 0
    n = int(input())  # Corrected to read n as an integer
    t = map(int, raw_input().split())  # This line is using Python 2 syntax, consider using input() in Python 3
    for i in range(n):
        a[t[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for i in range(-10, 0):
        ans += a[i] * a[-i]
    ans += a[0] * (a[0] - 1) // 2  # Use integer division to avoid floating point results
    print(ans)
```

With these corrections, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) representing the number of registered clients. The second line contains a list of integers t1, t2, ..., tn (-10 ≤ ti ≤ 10) where each ti is the parameter assigned to the i-th customer based on their interests.
def func():
    a = dict()
    for i in range(-10, 11):
        a[i] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `t1, t2, ..., tn` is a list of integers (-10 ≤ ti ≤ 10), `a` is a dictionary where each key from -10 to 10 is set to 0.
    n = input()
    t = map(int, raw_input().split())
    for i in range(n):
        a[t[i]] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of integers where each `ti` is an integer between -10 and 10, `a` is a dictionary where each key from -10 to 10 is set to the count of occurrences of that key in the list `t`.
    ans = 0
    for i in range(-10, 0):
        ans += a[i] * a[-i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of integers, `a` is a dictionary where each key from -10 to 10 is set to the count of occurrences of that key in the list `t`, `ans` is the sum of `a[i] * a[-i]` for all `i` in the range from -10 to -1.
    ans += a[0] * (a[0] - 1) / 2
    print(ans)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
