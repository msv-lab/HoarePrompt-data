Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is not an integer. The `input()` function in Python 2 reads input as a string, and when used without parameters, it expects the user to input a value. However, in the problem statement, `n` is explicitly defined as the number of registered clients, and it should be passed as an integer.

To fix this, the program should read `n` as an integer using `int(input())`. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = dict()
    for i in range(-10, 11):
        a[i] = 0
    n = int(input())  # Convert input to integer
    t = map(int, raw_input().split())
    for i in range(n):
        a[t[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for i in range(-10, 0):
        ans += a[i] * a[-i]
    ans += a[0] * (a[0] - 1) / 2
    print(ans)
```

With this correction, the program should now correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. However, since the original program had an issue with reading `n` as an integer, it is marked as incorrect.
