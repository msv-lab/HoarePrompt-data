Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to count the number of opposite couples. Specifically, the code only considers the counts of opposite pairs within the range from -10 to 10 and does not handle the case where `n` might be 0 or when the list `t` contains only zeros. Additionally, the code does not consider all possible opposite pairs within the given range. For instance, the code does not handle the case where `t` contains values outside the range from -10 to 10, which would still contribute to the count of opposite couples. 

A more comprehensive solution would need to iterate over all possible pairs within the range from -10 to 10 and correctly calculate the number of opposite couples. Here is an example where the provided code fails:

For the input:
```
5
-3 3 0 0 3
```
The expected output is 3, but the provided code correctly outputs 3.

However, for the input:
```
3
-5 5 0
```
The expected output is 1 (since -5 and 5 form one couple), but the provided code does not handle this case and would incorrectly output 0 because it only considers the range from -10 to 10 and does not account for values outside this range.

Thus, the code is not fully correct for every potential case.
