Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - A dictionary `a` is initialized to store the count of each possible value (`-10` to `10`) from the input list. This is done by setting each key in the dictionary to `0`.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The first line of input is read as an integer `n`, representing the number of clients.
   - The second line is split into a list of integers `t`, each corresponding to a client's parameter.

3. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - A loop iterates through the list `t` and increments the count for each value in the dictionary `a`.

4. **Calculating Opposite Pairs**:
   - The program then calculates the number of pairs of opposite values. For each key `i` in the range from `-10` to `-1`, it multiplies the count of `i` by the count of `-i` and adds this product to the total count `ans`.
   - Additionally, for the key `0`, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 out of the count of `0`s using the formula `a[0] * (a[0] - 1) / 2` and adds this to `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, the total count `ans` is printed, which represents the number of couples with opposite parameters.

The program handles all the necessary steps to meet the problem description accurately. It counts the occurrences of each parameter, calculates the number of opposite pairs, and handles the special case for `0`. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
