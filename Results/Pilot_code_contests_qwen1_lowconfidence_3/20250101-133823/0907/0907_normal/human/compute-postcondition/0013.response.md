Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `t` is a list of integers where each `ti` is an integer between -10 and 10, `a` is a dictionary where each key from -10 to 10 is set to 0, and `a[t[2]]` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `a[t[i]] += 1` increments the value of `a[t[i]]` by 1. Initially, `i` is 2, so `a[t[2]]` is set to 1. After executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, `i` is now 3. All other variables remain in their initial states, with the updated dictionary `a`.
