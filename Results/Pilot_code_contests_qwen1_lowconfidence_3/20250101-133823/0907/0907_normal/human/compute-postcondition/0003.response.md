Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `t1, t2, ..., tn` is a list of integers where \(-10 \leq ti \leq 10\).
   - `a` is a dictionary with key `i` set to `0`, and `i` is within the range \(-10\) to \(10\).

2. **Loop Context:**
   - The for loop iterates over the range from \(-10\) to \(10\), inclusive.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` has just completed its previous iteration.
   - Since the loop iterates over a fixed range \([-10, 10]\), the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration would be one of the values in this range, depending on which iteration it was.

4. **Determine the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and must still be within the range \([-10, 10]\).
   - The values of `n`, `t1, t2, ..., tn`, and `a` remain unchanged because the loop body does not modify these variables based on the given information.

5. **Next Iteration State:**
   - The new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
   - We need to ensure that the new value of `i` is still within the range \([-10, 10]\).

Given that the loop variable `i` is within \([-10, 10]\) and it just finished an iteration, let's assume the previous value of `i` was \(i_{prev}\). The next value of `i` will be \(i_{next} = i_{prev} + 1\).

Since the range is fixed and finite, if \(i_{prev} = 10\), then the next value cannot be incremented further as it would exceed the upper limit of 10.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

- `i` is now \(i_{prev} + 1\), ensuring it remains within the range \([-10, 10]\).
- `n`, `t1, t2, ..., tn`, and `a` remain unchanged.

If we denote the previous value of `i` as \(i_{prev}\):

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `t1, t2, ..., tn` is a list of integers (-10 ≤ ti ≤ 10), `a` is a dictionary with key `i` set to `0`, and `i` is now \(i_{prev} + 1\)**

For simplicity, if we assume the previous value of `i` was the maximum allowed (10), then the next value of `i` would wrap around to \(-9\).

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `t1, t2, ..., tn` is a list of integers (-10 ≤ ti ≤ 10), `a` is a dictionary with key `i` set to `0`, and `i` is now \(-9\)**
