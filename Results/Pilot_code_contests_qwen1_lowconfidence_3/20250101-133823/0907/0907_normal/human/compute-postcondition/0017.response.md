The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, or `a`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of integers where each `ti` is an integer between -10 and 10, `a` is a dictionary where each key from -10 to 10 is set to the count of occurrences of that key in the list `t`, `ans` is 0.**
