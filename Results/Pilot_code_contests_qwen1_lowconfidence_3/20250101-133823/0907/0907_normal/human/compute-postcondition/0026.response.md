The code snippet `print(ans)` simply prints the value of `ans` but does not change its value. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of integers, `a` is a dictionary where each key from -10 to 10 is set to the count of occurrences of that key in the list `t`, `ans` is the sum of `a[i] * a[-i]` for all `i` in the range from -10 to -1 plus `c * (c - 1) / 2` where `c` is the count of occurrences of `0` in the list `t`.**
