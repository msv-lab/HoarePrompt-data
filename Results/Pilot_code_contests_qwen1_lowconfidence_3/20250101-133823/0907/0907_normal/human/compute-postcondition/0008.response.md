The code `n = input()` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. However, without knowing the specific input provided by the user, we cannot determine the exact value of `n`. The other variables (`t1, t2, ..., tn`, and `a`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t1, t2, ..., tn` is a list of integers (-10 ≤ ti ≤ 10), `a` is a dictionary where each key from -10 to 10 is set to 0**
