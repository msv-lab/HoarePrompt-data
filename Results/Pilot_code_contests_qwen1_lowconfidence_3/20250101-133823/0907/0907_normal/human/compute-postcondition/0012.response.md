According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i = 2`. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 2 (since `i` is now 2).

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` is incremented to 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is a list of integers where each `ti` is an integer between -10 and 10, `a` is a dictionary where each key from -10 to 10 is set to 0, and `a[k]` is 1 where `k` is the value of `t[1]`.**
