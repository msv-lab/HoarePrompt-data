The code `t = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings, and then converts each string to an integer. This results in a list of integers stored in `t`. However, the initial values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. 

Since `raw_input().split()` depends on user input, we cannot determine the exact values of `t` without knowing the input. But we know that `t` is now a list of integers and the length of `t` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t1, t2, ..., tn` is a list of integers where each ti is an integer between -10 and 10, `a` is a dictionary where each key from -10 to 10 is set to 0**
