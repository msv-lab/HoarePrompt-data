`ans` is updated by adding the value of `a[0] * (a[0] - 1) / 2`. Since `a[0]` represents the count of occurrences of `0` in the list `t`, let's denote this count as `c`. Thus, `ans` is now `ans + c * (c - 1) / 2`.

The initial state is:
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `t` is a list of integers
- `a` is a dictionary where each key from -10 to 10 is set to the count of occurrences of that key in the list `t`
- `ans` is the sum of `a[i] * a[-i]` for all `i` in the range from -10 to -1

After executing the code snippet, the only change is in the value of `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of integers, `a` is a dictionary where each key from -10 to 10 is set to the count of occurrences of that key in the list `t`, `ans` is the sum of `a[i] * a[-i]` for all `i` in the range from -10 to -1 plus `c * (c - 1) / 2` where `c` is the count of occurrences of `0` in the list `t`.**
