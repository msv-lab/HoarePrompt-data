The code `a[i] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the key `i` in the dictionary `a`. Since `i` is within the range `-10` to `10`, the value of `i` will be one of the integers from `-10` to `10`. The other variables (`n`, `t1, t2, ..., tn`, and `a` for keys other than `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `t1, t2, ..., tn` is a list of integers (-10 ≤ ti ≤ 10), `a` is a dictionary with key `i` set to `0`, `i` is within the range `-10` to `10`**
