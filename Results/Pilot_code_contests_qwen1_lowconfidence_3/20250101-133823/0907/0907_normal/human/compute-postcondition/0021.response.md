First, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet:

- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `t` is a list of integers with at least one integer in the range -10 to -1.
- `a` is a dictionary where each key from -10 to 10 is set to the count of occurrences of that key in the list `t`.
- `ans` is 4.
- `i` is -2.

The code snippet is:
```python
ans += a[i] * a[-i]
```

Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. The value of `i` is -2.
2. The code accesses `a[i]` which is `a[-2]`. From the initial state, `a` is a dictionary where each key from -10 to 10 is set to the count of occurrences of that key in the list `t`. So, `a[-2]` is the count of occurrences of -2 in the list `t`.
3. Similarly, `a[-i]` is `a[2]`, which is the count of occurrences of 2 in the list `t`.
4. The product of these two counts is calculated and added to `ans`.

Since `i` is -2, the relevant part of the dictionary `a` would be checked for the counts of -2 and 2. Let's denote the count of -2 in the list `t` as `count_neg2` and the count of 2 in the list `t` as `count_2`.

So, the code effectively does:
```python
ans += count_neg2 * count_2
```

Given that `ans` was initially 4, the new value of `ans` would be:
```python
ans = 4 + count_neg2 * count_2
```

Since the exact values of `count_neg2` and `count_2` are not specified, the final state of the variables is:
- `n` remains a non-negative integer.
- `t` remains a list of integers with at least one integer in the range -10 to -1.
- `a` remains a dictionary where each key from -10 to 10 is set to the count of occurrences of that key in the list `t`.
- `ans` is now `4 + count_neg2 * count_2`.
- `i` remains -2.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of integers with at least one integer in the range -10 to -1, `a` is a dictionary where each key from -10 to 10 is set to the count of occurrences of that key in the list `t`, `ans` is 4 + count_neg2 * count_2, `i` is -2.**
