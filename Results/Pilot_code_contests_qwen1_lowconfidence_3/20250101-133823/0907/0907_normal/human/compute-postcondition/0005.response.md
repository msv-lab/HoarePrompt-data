According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -10 to 10. At the end of the previous iteration, the variable `i` is -9, and it is within the range of -10 to 10. Therefore, the loop can execute again with `i` incremented by 1.

The current state at the end of the previous iteration is as follows:
- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
- `t1, t2, ..., tn` is a list of integers (-10 ≤ ti ≤ 10)
- `a` is a dictionary with key `-9` set to `0`
- `i` is -9

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 0.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `t1, t2, ..., tn` is a list of integers (-10 ≤ ti ≤ 10), `a` is a dictionary with key `-9` set to `0`, and `i` is now 0**
