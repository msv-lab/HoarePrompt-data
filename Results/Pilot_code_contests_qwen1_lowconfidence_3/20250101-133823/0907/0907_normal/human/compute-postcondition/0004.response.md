The code `a[i] = 0` assigns the value 0 to the key `i` in the dictionary `a`. Given that the initial value of `i` is \(-9\), the dictionary `a` will have the key \(-9\) with the value 0. No other variables are affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `t1, t2, ..., tn` is a list of integers (-10 ≤ ti ≤ 10), `a` is a dictionary with key `-9` set to `0`, and `i` is now \(-9**.
