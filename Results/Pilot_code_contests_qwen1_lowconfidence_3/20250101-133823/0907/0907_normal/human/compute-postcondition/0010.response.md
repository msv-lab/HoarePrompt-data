According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Additionally, the variables `i` should start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.

Before the loop starts, we know:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `t1, t2, ..., tn` is a list of integers where each `ti` is an integer between -10 and 10.
- `a` is a dictionary where each key from -10 to 10 is set to 0.

To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be 0 initially.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t1, t2, ..., tn` is a list of integers where each `ti` is an integer between -10 and 10, `a` is a dictionary where each key from -10 to 10 is set to 0**
