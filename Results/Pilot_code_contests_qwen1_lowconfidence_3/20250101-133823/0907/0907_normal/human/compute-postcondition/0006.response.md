The code `a[i] = 0` updates the dictionary `a` by setting the value at key `i` to `0`. Given that `i` was initially `0` and `a` was `{ -9: 0 }`, after executing this line, `a` will become `{ -9: 0, 0: 0 }`. The other variables (`n`, `t1, t2, ..., tn`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `t1, t2, ..., tn` is a list of integers (-10 ≤ ti ≤ 10), `a` is a dictionary with key `-9` set to `0` and key `0` set to `0`, and `i` is now `0`**
