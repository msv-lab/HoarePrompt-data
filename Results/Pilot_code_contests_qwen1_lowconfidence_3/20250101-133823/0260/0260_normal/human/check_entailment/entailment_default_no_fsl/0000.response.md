Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a logical error that prevents it from correctly counting the number of operations Tokitsukaze would perform. Specifically, the code fails to properly handle the movement of items after discarding special items on a page. The key issue is in how the `curr` value is adjusted and how the offset is handled.

Let's consider the following example to illustrate the problem:

Input:
```
10 4 5
3 5 7 10
```

Expected output:
```
3
```

However, the code provided will produce an incorrect result. Here's why:

1. **Initial State**: The first page is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and it contains the special items at indices 3 and 5.
2. **First Operation**: The code correctly identifies that items at indices 3 and 5 should be discarded. After discarding these items, the first page becomes `[1, 2, 4, 6, 7]`.
3. **Second Operation**: The code then checks the next page, but it incorrectly assumes that the special item at index 7 should be discarded without considering the movement of the remaining items. The code should move the item at index 6 to index 3, making the first page `[1, 2, 6, 4, 7]`, and then the next page becomes `[9, 10]` with the special item at index 10. 

The code does not correctly handle the movement of items and adjusts the `curr` value and offset accordingly. This leads to an incorrect count of operations.

To fix this, the code needs to correctly simulate the movement of items after discarding special items and adjust the `curr` value and offset accordingly. This involves more complex logic to ensure that the items are moved correctly and the pages are checked properly.

Since the provided code does not handle the movement and adjustment of items correctly, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
