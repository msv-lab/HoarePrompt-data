Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the special items are spread across multiple pages in such a way that the first special item on a page is not the first special item globally. For example, consider the following input:

```
n = 10
m = 4
k = 5
p = [4, 6, 8, 10]
```

In this case, the special items are on the second page (positions 4, 6, 8, 10), but the program incorrectly skips the first operation because the first special item (position 4) is not within the range defined by `curr * k` and `offset + curr * k + k`. The correct behavior would be to start discarding items from the second page as soon as the first special item is encountered. The program should be revised to ensure that it checks and discards special items on the current page correctly.
