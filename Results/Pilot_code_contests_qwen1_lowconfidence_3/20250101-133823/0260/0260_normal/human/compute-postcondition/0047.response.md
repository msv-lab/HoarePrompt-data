The code updates the value of `curr` based on the value of `nums[i]`, `offset`, `curr`, and `k`. Given the initial condition `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`, let's calculate the new value of `curr`.

The updated value of `curr` is given by:
\[ \text{curr} += \frac{\text{nums}[i] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} * k) - 1}{k} \]

Since `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`, we know that `nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1` is a positive number. Let's denote this difference as `diff`:
\[ \text{diff} = \text{nums}[i] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} * k) - 1 \]
So,
\[ \text{curr} += \frac{\text{diff}}{k} \]

The exact numerical value of `curr` depends on the actual values of `nums[i]`, `offset`, `curr`, and `k`. However, we can express the new value of `curr` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`i` is the smallest index such that `nums[i]` is greater than `offset + curr * k + k`, and `i` must be less than `m`, and `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`; `curr` is updated by adding `(nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k` to its current value.**
