Output State: **`m` is the final value of `m`, `i` is `m`, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order such that \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m \leq n\), `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `data[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0, and `nums[i]` (which is `nums[m]`) is greater than `offset + curr * k + k`**
