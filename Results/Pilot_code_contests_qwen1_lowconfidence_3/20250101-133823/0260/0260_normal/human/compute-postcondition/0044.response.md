`offset` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is either equal to `m` or the next index where `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`, and `i` must still be less than `m`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is either equal to `m` or the next index where `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`, and `i` must still be less than `m`; `offset` is equal to `i`**
