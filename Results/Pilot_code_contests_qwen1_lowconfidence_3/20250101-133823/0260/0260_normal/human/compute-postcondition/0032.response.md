The code `op += 1` increments the value of `op` by 1. The initial state is defined such that `i` is the smallest index `j` such that `nums[j] > offset + curr * k + k` or `i` equals `m`, and `m` must be greater than 0. `i` is incremented until `nums[i]` is no longer less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`, and `offset` is equal to `i`. 

After executing `op += 1`, the value of `op` is incremented by 1, but the conditions and values of `i`, `m`, and `offset` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the smallest index `j` such that `nums[j] > offset + curr * k + k` or `i` equals `m`, `m` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented until `nums[i]` is no longer less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`; `offset` is equal to `i`, `op` is incremented by 1.**
