State: **`i` is the original value of `i` plus 2, and `i` must still be less than `m` and `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initial Condition**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the original value of `i` plus 1. The loop condition for the `while` loop is `i < m and nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`.

2. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increment again (since it incremented once in the previous iteration). Therefore, `i` should now be the original value of `i` plus 2.

3. **Loop Condition**: The condition `i < m and nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k` must still hold true for the next iteration. Since we know that `i` is now the original value of `i` plus 2, this condition should still be valid for `i` to be incremented further.

4. **Final State**: To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be the original value of `i` plus 2, and the condition `i < m and nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k` must still be satisfied.

Thus, the state to be adjusted for the next iteration is:
- `i` is the original value of `i` plus 2.
- `i` must still be less than `m`.
- `nums[i]` must still satisfy the condition `<= offset + curr * k + k`.
