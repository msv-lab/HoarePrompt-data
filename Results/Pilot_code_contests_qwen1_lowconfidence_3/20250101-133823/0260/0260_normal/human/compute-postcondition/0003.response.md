`k` is assigned the value `data[2]`. The value of `m` remains `data[1]`, the value of `p` remains a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, and `data` remains the list of integers obtained from the input, with `n` being `data[0]`.

Output State: **`m` is `data[1]`, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order such that \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m \leq n\), `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `data[0]`**
