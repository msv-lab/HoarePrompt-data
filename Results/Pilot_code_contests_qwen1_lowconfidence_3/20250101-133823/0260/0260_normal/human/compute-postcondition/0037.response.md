Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - `i` is the smallest index such that `nums[i]` is greater than `offset + curr * k + k`.
   - `i` must be less than `m`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < m` and `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`.

For the loop to execute at least one iteration:
- The loop condition `i < m` must be true.
- The loop condition `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k` must also be true.

Given these conditions:
- Since `i` is defined as the smallest index where `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`, the current state has `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`.
- However, to enter the loop, we need the condition `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k` to be false at the next iteration, meaning `nums[i]` should be strictly greater than `offset + curr * k + k`.

Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to proceed, we need to ensure that:
- `i` remains the same (since it is the smallest index satisfying the condition).
- `nums[i]` changes to a value greater than `offset + curr * k + k`.

However, since we are only asked to modify the program state right before the loop and not change the actual values of `nums` array, we need to ensure the loop can start executing.

So, the necessary adjustment is to ensure `i < m` remains true, which is already satisfied given the initial state. No other adjustments are needed in terms of the provided variables.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is the smallest index such that `nums[i]` is greater than `offset + curr * k + k`, and `i` must be less than `m`**
