`i` is incremented by 1. The previous condition that `i` is less than `m` and `nums[i]` is less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k` remains true because the increment operation only affects `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is less than `m` and `nums[i]` is less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`; `i` is increased by 1**
