`i` is incremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `i` must still be less than `m` and `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`. After incrementing `i` by 1, the condition for `i` remains the same. Therefore, the updated state for `i` is that it is now `i + 1` and it must still be less than `m` and `nums[i + 1] <= offset + curr * k + k`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, and it must still be less than `m` and `nums[i + 1] <= offset + curr * k + k`**
