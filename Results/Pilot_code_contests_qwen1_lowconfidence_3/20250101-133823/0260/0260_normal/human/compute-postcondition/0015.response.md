Let's break down the given conditions and determine what adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Conditions at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `m` must be greater than 3.
- `i` must be less than `m`.
- `nums[3]` must be less than or equal to `2k`.
- `i` is increased by 1.

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as both of the following conditions are true:
- `i < m`
- `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`

### Analysis:

1. **Condition `i < m`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was less than `m`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` should still be less than `m`.
   - Since `i` is increased by 1 in the loop body, we need to ensure that `i + 1 < m`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than `m - 1` before the loop body runs.

2. **Condition `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was such that `nums[i]` satisfied this condition.
   - For the loop to continue, `nums[i + 1]` (the new value of `i`) must satisfy this condition.
   - Therefore, `nums[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`.

### Summary of Adjustments:
- `i` must be less than `m - 1` before the loop body runs.
- `nums[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`.

### Final State:
State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `i` must be less than `m - 1`, and `nums[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`**
