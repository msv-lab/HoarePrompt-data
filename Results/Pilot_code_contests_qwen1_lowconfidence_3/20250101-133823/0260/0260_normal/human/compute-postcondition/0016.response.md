`i` is incremented by 1, which means the new value of `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1. The conditions and constraints for `m` and `nums[i + 1]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `i` must be less than `m - 1`, and `nums[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`; `i` is the original value of `i` + 1**
