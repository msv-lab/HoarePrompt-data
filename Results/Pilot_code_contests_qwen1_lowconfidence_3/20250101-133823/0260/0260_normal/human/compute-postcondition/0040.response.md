`i` is incremented by 1 based on its current value, which was the smallest index such that `nums[i]` is greater than `offset + curr * k + k`, and then `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, after executing `i += 1`, the new value of `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1.

Output State: **`i` is the original value of `i` plus 1, and `i` must still be less than `m` and `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`.**
