Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < m and nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is that the variable `i` has been increased by 1.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions in the `and` expression must be true:
     - `i < m`: This checks if `i` is less than `m`.
     - `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`: This checks if the current value of `nums[i]` is less than or equal to the specified value.

4. **Current Values**:
   - `i` has been increased by 1, but we don't know its exact value.
   - We know that `i` was increased by 1 from some previous value, say `i-1`.

5. **Ensure the Loop Executes Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m`.
   - Additionally, `nums[i]` must be less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`.

6. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `i` has been incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `m`.
   - We also need to ensure that `nums[i]` satisfies the second condition.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes again, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is still within the bounds and `nums[i]` meets the condition.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is less than `m` and `nums[i]` is less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`**
