Postcondition: **`i` is the smallest index such that `nums[i]` is greater than `offset + curr * k + k` and is less than `m`. If the condition `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k` is true, then `op` is incremented by 1, and `i` is either equal to `m` or the next index where `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`, with `offset` being set to `i`. Otherwise, `i` is updated to the smallest index where `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`, and `curr` is updated by adding `(nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k` to its current value.**
