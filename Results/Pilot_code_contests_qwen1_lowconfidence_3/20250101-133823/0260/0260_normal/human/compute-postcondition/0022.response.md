Postcondition: ***`m` is `data[1]`, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order such that \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m \leq n\), `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `data[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `curr` is `(nums[2] - 1) / k`, `offset` is 0, `i` is 2, `op` is 0, if `nums[i]` is less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`, then `m` becomes the final value of `m`, `i` becomes `m`, and `op` becomes 1 more than its original value. Otherwise, `offset` is set to `m`.***
