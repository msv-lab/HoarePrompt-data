The code initializes the variable `offset` to 0. This does not affect any of the previously defined variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`m` is `data[1]`, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order such that \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m \leq n\), `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `data[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0.**
