`op` is incremented by 1, but the specific value of `i` and `m` is not given, and `offset` is still equal to `i`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `op` and retains the conditions specified for `i` and `offset`.

Output State: **`op` is `op + 1`, `i` is either equal to `m` or the next index where `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`, and `i` must still be less than `m`; `offset` is equal to `i`**
