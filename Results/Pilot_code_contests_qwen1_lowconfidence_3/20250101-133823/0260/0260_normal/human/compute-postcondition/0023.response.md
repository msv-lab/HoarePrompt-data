To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will continue to iterate.

Given:
- The loop continues as long as `i < m`.
- `i` is initially 2.
- `m` is defined as `data[1]`.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input.
- `curr` is calculated as `(nums[2] - 1) / k`.
- `offset` is initially 0.
- `op` is initially 0.
- If `nums[i]` is less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`, then `m` remains unchanged, `i` is set to `m`, and `op` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `offset` is set to `m`.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Condition for Loop Continuation**: The loop will continue as long as `i < m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m`.

2. **Current Values**:
   - `m` is `data[1]`.
   - `i` is 2 (at the end of the previous iteration).

For the loop to continue:
- `i` must be less than `m`.

Given `i = 2`, the condition `i < m` will only be true if `m > 2`.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `m` must be greater than 2.

**Final State:**
State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `op` is 0, `curr` is `(nums[2] - 1) / k`, `offset` is 0, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order such that \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m \leq n\), `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `data[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input.**
