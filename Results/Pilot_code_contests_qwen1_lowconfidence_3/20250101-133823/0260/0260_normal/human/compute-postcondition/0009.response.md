According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, and `m` is `data[1]`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` needs to be incremented to 1, and `m` should remain as `data[1]`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`m` is `data[1]`, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order such that \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m \leq n\), `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `data[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0, `i` is 1, `op` is 0**
