The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` was 0, so after executing `i += 1`, the new value of `i` is 1. The values of `m` and `nums[0]` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `nums[0]` must be less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `nums[0]` must be less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`**
