Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the current state step by step.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while i < m and nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Given states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `m` (which is `data[1]`) must be greater than 1
- `k` is `data[2]`
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order such that \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m \leq n\)
- `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `n` is `data[0]`
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input
- `curr` is 0
- `offset` is 0
- `i` is 2
- `nums[1]` is less than or equal to `2k`

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to check the loop condition:
1. `i < m`
2. `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`

Since `curr` is 0 and `offset` is 0, the second condition simplifies to:
\[ nums[i] \leq k + k = 2k \]

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `nums[1]` is less than or equal to `2k`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m` and `nums[i]` must be less than or equal to `2k`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `i < m`:**
   - Currently, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3, and this increment should not violate the condition `i < m`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than `m` at the start of the next iteration.

2. **Condition `nums[i] <= 2k`:**
   - We need to ensure that the next value of `i` (which would be 3) satisfies this condition.
   - The current value of `nums[2]` is not explicitly given, but we need to ensure it is within the range such that the condition holds.

Since the exact value of `nums[2]` is not specified, we cannot directly adjust it. However, we know that the loop will continue as long as the condition `i < m` holds true and the value of `nums[i]` (which will be `nums[3]` in the next iteration) is less than or equal to `2k`.

### Conclusion:
- To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3, and `i` must still be less than `m`.
- Additionally, `nums[3]` must be less than or equal to `2k` in the next iteration.

Given these conditions, the required adjustments are:
- `i` must be less than `m` at the start of the next iteration.
- The next value of `i` (which would be 3) must satisfy the condition `nums[3] <= 2k`.

Therefore, the modified state for the next iteration is:
State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `i` must be less than `m` and `nums[3]` must be less than or equal to `2k`**
