Postcondition: ***`i` is the smallest index such that `nums[i]` is greater than `offset + curr * k + k`. If `i` is found, `offset` is set to `i` and `op` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `nums[i]` is an integer, `offset` is an integer, `curr` is an integer with an adjustment of `delta = (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k`, and `k` remains an integer.***
