The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `p`. The constraints are as follows:
- `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(10^{18}\).
- `m` is a positive integer not exceeding \(10^5\).
- `k` is a positive integer not less than 1 and not exceeding `n`.
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order such that \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m \leq n\).

The output cases are not specified directly, but we understand that the function will return something based on these inputs. Since no specific output cases are given, we can state that the function processes the inputs according to some defined logic.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `p`, where `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(10^{18}\), `m` is a positive integer not exceeding \(10^5\), `k` is a positive integer not less than 1 and not exceeding `n`, and `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order such that \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m \leq n\).**
