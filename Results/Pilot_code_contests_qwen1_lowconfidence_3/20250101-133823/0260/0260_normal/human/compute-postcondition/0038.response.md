The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was initially the smallest index such that `nums[i]` is greater than `offset + curr * k + k`, and `i` must be less than `m`, the new value of `i` will be the next integer after the original value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is now one more than its original value, which means `i` is the smallest index such that `nums[i]` is greater than `offset + curr * k + k` but incremented by 1, and `i` is still less than `m`.

Output State: **`i` is the smallest index such that `nums[i]` is greater than `offset + curr * k + k` and incremented by 1, and `i` is less than `m`**
