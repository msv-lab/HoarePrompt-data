`curr` is updated by adding the value of `(nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k` to it. Given the initial condition that `nums[i]` is greater than `offset + curr * k + k`, we can simplify the expression within the parentheses:

1. Start with the initial condition: `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`.
2. Rearrange this inequality to isolate the term in the expression: `nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1 > k - 1`.
3. This simplifies to: `(nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k > (k - 1) / k`.

Since `nums[i]` is an integer and it's greater than `offset + curr * k + k`, let's denote the simplified expression as `delta` which is a positive integer.

Therefore, `curr` is updated by adding `delta` to its current value. The output state is:

Output State: **`nums[i]` is an integer, `offset` is an integer, `curr` is an integer + delta, `k` is an integer, where delta is `(nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k`.**
