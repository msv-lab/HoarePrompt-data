The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `curr`. This does not affect the values of `m`, `k`, `p`, `data`, `n`, or `nums`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`m` is `data[1]`, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order such that \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m \leq n\), `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `data[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `curr` is 0.**
