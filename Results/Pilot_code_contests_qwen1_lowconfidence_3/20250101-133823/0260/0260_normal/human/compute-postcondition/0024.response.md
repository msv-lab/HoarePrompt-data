State right before the while loop: `i` is 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `nums` is a list, `offset` is an integer, `curr` is an integer, and `k` is a positive integer.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The condition for the loop to execute is `i < m and nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`.
2. Right before the loop, `i` is 0.
3. For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that the condition `0 < m` (since `i` is 0, `i < m` must hold true) and `nums[0] <= offset + curr * k + k` must be true.

Since `i` is already 0, we need to focus on ensuring that `m > 0` and `nums[0] <= offset + curr * k + k`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `nums[0]` must be less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`.

State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `nums[0]` must be less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`**
