The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 1, so now `i` is 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` (which is `data[1]`) must be greater than 1, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order such that \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m \leq n\), `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `data[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0, `i` is 2, and `nums[1]` is less than or equal to `2k`.**
