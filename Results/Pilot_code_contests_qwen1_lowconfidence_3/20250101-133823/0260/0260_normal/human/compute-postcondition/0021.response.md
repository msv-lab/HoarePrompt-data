Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. The initial state is defined as follows:
   - `m` is `data[1]`
   - `k` is `data[2]`
   - `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order such that \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m \leq n\)
   - `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input
   - `n` is `data[0]`
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input
   - `curr` is 0
   - `offset` is 0
   - `i` is 2
   - `op` is 0
   - `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   curr += (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k
   ```

3. Let's break down the expression `(nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k`:
   - `offset` is 0
   - `curr` is 0
   - `i` is 2
   - So, the expression simplifies to `(nums[2] - (0 + 0 * k) - 1) / k = (nums[2] - 1) / k`

4. Since `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`, we know that `nums[2] > 0 + 0 * k + k`, which means `nums[2] > k`. Let's denote `nums[2]` as `num_val`.

5. Therefore, the updated value of `curr` is:
   ```python
   curr = curr + (num_val - 1) / k
   ```
   Given `curr` was initially 0, the new value of `curr` is:
   ```python
   curr = (num_val - 1) / k
   ```

6. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is `data[1]`, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order such that \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m \leq n\), `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `data[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `curr` is `(nums[2] - 1) / k`, `offset` is 0, `i` is 2, `op` is 0, and `nums[2] > k`**
