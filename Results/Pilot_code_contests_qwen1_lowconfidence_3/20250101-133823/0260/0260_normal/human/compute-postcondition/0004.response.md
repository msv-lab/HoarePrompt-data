The code reads a line of input using `raw_input()`, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts each string to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. This means that `nums` will be assigned a list of integers based on the user's input.

Given the initial state:
- `m` is `data[1]`
- `k` is `data[2]`
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order such that \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m \leq n\)
- `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `n` is `data[0]`

After executing the code, the value of `nums` will be updated to the list of integers obtained from the user's input. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is `data[1]`, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order such that \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m \leq n\), `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `data[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input.**
