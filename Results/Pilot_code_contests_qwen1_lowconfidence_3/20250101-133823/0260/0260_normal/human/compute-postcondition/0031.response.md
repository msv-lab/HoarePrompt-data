The code assigns the value of `i` to `offset`. This means that `offset` now holds whatever value `i` held before the assignment. The value of `i` remains unchanged after this assignment. Therefore, the only change is that `offset` is now equal to `i`.

Output State: **`i` is equal to the smallest index `j` such that `nums[j] > offset + curr * k + k` or `i` equals `m`, `m` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented until `nums[i]` is no longer less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`; `offset` is equal to `i`**
