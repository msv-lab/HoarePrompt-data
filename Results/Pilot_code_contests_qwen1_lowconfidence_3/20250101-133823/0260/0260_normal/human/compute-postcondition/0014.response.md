`i` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions are that `m` must be greater than 3, `i` must be less than `m`, and `nums[3]` must be less than or equal to `2k`. After executing `i += 1`, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`, but the exact value depends on the initial value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `i` must be less than `m`, and `nums[3]` must be less than or equal to `2k`; `i` is increased by 1**
