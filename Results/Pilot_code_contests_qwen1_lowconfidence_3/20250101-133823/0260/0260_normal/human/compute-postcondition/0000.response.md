The code `data = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `data`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `p` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(10^{18}\), `m` is a positive integer not exceeding \(10^5\), `k` is a positive integer not less than 1 and not exceeding `n`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order such that \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m \leq n\), `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
