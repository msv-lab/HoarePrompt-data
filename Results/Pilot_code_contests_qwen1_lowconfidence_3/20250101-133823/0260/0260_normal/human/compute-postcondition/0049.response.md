Output State: **`m` is `data[1]`, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order such that \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m \leq n\), `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `data[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `curr` is an integer with the final value after processing all elements, `offset` is the index of the last element processed, `i` is `m`, `op` is the number of valid segments identified, if `nums[i]` is greater than `offset + curr * k + k` for all elements, then `op` is the count of valid segments and `i` is `m`, otherwise, `curr` is adjusted based on the differences between elements in `nums` and the calculated values.**
