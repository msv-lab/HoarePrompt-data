The initial state is as follows:
- `m` is a positive integer not exceeding \(10^5\)
- `k` is a positive integer not less than 1 and not exceeding `n`
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order such that \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m \leq n\)
- `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `n` is `data[0]`

The code snippet is:
```python
m = data[1]
```

This line of code updates the value of `m` to be the second element of the `data` list. Since `data[0]` is equal to `n`, the new value of `m` is `data[1]`.

Output State: **`m` is `data[1]`, `k` is a positive integer not less than 1 and not exceeding `n`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order such that \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m \leq n\), `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `data[0]`**
