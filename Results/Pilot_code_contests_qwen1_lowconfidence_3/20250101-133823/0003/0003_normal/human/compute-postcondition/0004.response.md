The code defines a lambda function `rstr_2d` which takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` strings, each obtained by reading a line from standard input using the `rstr()` function (which strips any trailing whitespace). However, the lambda function itself does not execute and does not modify the values of any variables directly. It only defines a function.

Therefore, the only change is the definition of the function `rstr_2d`. The initial conditions regarding `n`, the input edges, and the definition of `rstr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); the input consists of \(n-1\) lines, each containing two integers \(u\) and \(v\) representing an edge between nodes \(u\) and \(v\) in a tree; the lambda function `rstr_2d` is defined to read a line from standard input and strip any trailing whitespace.**
