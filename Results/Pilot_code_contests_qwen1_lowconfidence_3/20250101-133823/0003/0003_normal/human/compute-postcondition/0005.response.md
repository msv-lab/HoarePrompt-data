The provided code defines a lambda function `rint_2d` which reads `n` lines from standard input, strips any trailing whitespace from each line, and returns a list of these lines converted into lists of integers. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- The input consists of \(n-1\) lines, each containing two integers \(u\) and \(v\) representing an edge between nodes \(u\) and \(v\) in a tree
- The lambda function `rstr_2d` is defined to read a line from standard input and strip any trailing whitespace.

The lambda function `rint_2d` will read \(n\) lines of input and convert them into a list of lists of integers. However, since the actual input lines are not provided in the initial state, the specific values of the list elements cannot be determined. 

Therefore, the output state after executing the code is:
- The lambda function `rint_2d` is defined
- The variable `n` retains its initial value (an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\))
- The input is processed and converted into a list of lists of integers, but the specific contents of this list are not known.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), the lambda function `rint_2d` is defined, and the input is processed into a list of lists of integers**.
