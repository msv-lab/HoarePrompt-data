The provided code defines a lambda function `rstr` that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. This does not affect the values of any variables or the structure of the input data. The initial state includes the integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and the input consisting of n-1 lines, each containing two integers u and v representing an edge between nodes u and v in a tree.

Since no actual computation or assignment is performed on any variables within the given code snippet, the only change is the definition of the lambda function `rstr`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the input consists of n-1 lines, each containing two integers u and v representing an edge between nodes u and v in a tree. The lambda function `rstr` is defined to read a line from standard input and strip any trailing whitespace.**
