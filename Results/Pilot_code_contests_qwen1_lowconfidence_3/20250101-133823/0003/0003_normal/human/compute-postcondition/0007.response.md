The code defines a lambda function `pr` that takes two arguments: `args` and `sep`. It writes to `stdout` the `args` (which is a list or iterable) joined by `sep` followed by a newline character. 

- The lambda function `pr` is now defined.
- The lambda function `rint_2d` was initially defined, but no changes were made to it in this code snippet.
- The variable `rints_2d` remains undefined since it was not affected by the given code.

Therefore, the only change is the definition of the `pr` lambda function.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); the lambda function `pr` is defined as `pr = lambda args, sep: stdout.write(sep.join(map(str, args)) + '\n')`; `rint_2d` is defined; `rints_2d` is undefined.**
