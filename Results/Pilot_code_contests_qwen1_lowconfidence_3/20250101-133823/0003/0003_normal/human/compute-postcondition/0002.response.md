The code defines a lambda function `rint` that reads an integer from standard input (after stripping any trailing whitespace). This does not assign a value to any variable but instead creates a new function `rint` that can be called later to get an integer input.

Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the creation of the `rint` function. The value of `n` is still an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and the input consists of \(n-1\) lines, each containing two integers \(u\) and \(v\) representing an edge between nodes \(u\) and \(v\) in a tree.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); the input consists of \(n-1\) lines, each containing two integers \(u\) and \(v\) representing an edge between nodes \(u\) and \(v\) in a tree; the lambda function `rint` is defined to read a line from standard input and strip any trailing whitespace.**
