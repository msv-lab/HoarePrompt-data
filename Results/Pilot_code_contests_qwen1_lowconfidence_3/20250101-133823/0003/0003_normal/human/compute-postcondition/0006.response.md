The code defines a lambda function `rints_2d` which generates a list of lists of integers, each inner list having a length equal to `n`. However, the actual values of the integers in these lists are not determined by the given code snippet. The code does not assign any specific values to these lists, it only defines the structure.

Given the initial state where `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and the lambda function `rint_2d` is defined, the lambda function `rint_2d` is now defined but no actual list is generated or assigned to `rints_2d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), the lambda function `rint_2d` is defined, `rints_2d` is undefined.**
