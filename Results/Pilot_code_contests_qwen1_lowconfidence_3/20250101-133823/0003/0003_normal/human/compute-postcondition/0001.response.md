The given code defines a lambda function `rstrs` which reads a line from standard input, splits it into elements, and converts each element to a string. However, the lambda function itself does not execute any input operations or modify any existing variables. It only defines how the input would be processed if called.

Since no actual input is read or processed within the provided code snippet, the initial state remains unchanged. The lambda function `rstrs` is defined, but it does not affect the values of `n` or any other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the input consists of n-1 lines, each containing two integers u and v representing an edge between nodes u and v in a tree; the lambda function rstrs is defined to read a line from standard input and strip any trailing whitespace.**
