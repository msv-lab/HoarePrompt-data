The code defines a lambda function `rints` which reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. This lambda function does not change the values of `n` or any other existing variables; it merely defines a new function. Therefore, the only change is the definition of the `rints` function.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); the input consists of \(n-1\) lines, each containing two integers \(u\) and \(v\) representing an edge between nodes \(u\) and \(v\) in a tree; the lambda function `rints` is defined to read a line from standard input and strip any trailing whitespace.**
