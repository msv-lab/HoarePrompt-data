The code initializes an empty list `out`. The variables `n`, `pr`, `rint_2d`, and `rints_2d` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `out` being an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); the lambda function `pr` is defined as `pr = lambda args, sep: stdout.write(sep.join(map(str, args)) + '\n')`; `rint_2d` is defined; `rints_2d` is undefined; `out` is an empty list.**
