`delta` is assigned the value `10 - nums[i] % 10`. Since `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, the value of `nums[i]` is the last digit of the `i-th` element in `nums`. Given that `i` is 2, `nums[2]` is the third element in the list. The `%` operator calculates the remainder of `nums[2]` when divided by 10, and this value is subtracted from 10 to get `delta`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is unchanged, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `delta` is 10 - `nums[2] % 10`, `stop` is `False`.**
