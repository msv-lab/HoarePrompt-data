The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most internal if statement. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement (like an if statement) directly affecting the variables, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is less than delta, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `delta` is 10 - (`original_nums_0` + delta), and `stop` is `False`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
