The code calculates the sum of the list `nums` where each element is divided by 10 and rounded to the nearest multiple of 10. However, the code does not directly modify any variable values and only prints the result. Therefore, the values of `stop`, `k`, `nums`, and `n` remain unchanged. The code also does not have access to the actual values of `nums` elements since they are placeholders in the initial state description.

Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `k` is either `0` or less than `0`, `nums[i]` for each `i` such that `0 <= i < n` is adjusted to the nearest multiple of 10, `n` is `0`**
