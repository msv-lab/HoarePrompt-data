Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is less than delta, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `delta` is 10 - (`original_nums_0` + delta), and `stop` is `False`. If `nums[i]` is equal to 100, we continue with the next iteration of the loop or conditional block. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
