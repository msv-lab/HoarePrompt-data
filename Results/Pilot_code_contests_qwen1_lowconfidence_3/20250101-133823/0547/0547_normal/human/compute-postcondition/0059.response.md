`nums[i]` is incremented by `delta`. The value of `i` and the value of `delta` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `nums[i]`. However, we know that `nums[i]` was initially 100, and it is now increased by `delta`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`stop` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `nums[i]` is 100 + `delta`**
