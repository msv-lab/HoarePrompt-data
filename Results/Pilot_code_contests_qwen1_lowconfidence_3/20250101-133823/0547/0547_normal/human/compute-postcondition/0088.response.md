The code `break` does not affect any variables and simply breaks out of the nearest loop or match case. Since there is no loop or match case context in the initial state, the only thing that happens is breaking out of an imaginary loop or match case. The value of `k` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is an integer and its value is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or match case.**
