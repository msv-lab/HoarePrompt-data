First, let's determine the value of `delta`. From the initial state, we have:

- `delta` is `10 - (100 + delta_initial) % 10`

Given this, we need to know `delta_initial` to find `delta`. However, since `delta_initial` is not specified, let's denote it as `delta_initial`.

- `delta = 10 - (100 + delta_initial) % 10`

Next, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
nums[i] = nums[i] + delta
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `nums[i]` is `100 + delta_initial`
- `i` is 1

So, the code changes `nums[i]` to `nums[i] + delta`. Substituting the known values:

- `nums[i]` becomes `(100 + delta_initial) + (10 - (100 + delta_initial) % 10)`

Let's simplify this:

- Let `remainder = (100 + delta_initial) % 10`
- Then `delta = 10 - remainder`

Therefore, `nums[i]` becomes:

- `nums[i] = (100 + delta_initial) + (10 - remainder)`
- Since `remainder = (100 + delta_initial) % 10`, we substitute back:
- `nums[i] = (100 + delta_initial) + (10 - (100 + delta_initial) % 10)`

This simplifies to:

- `nums[i] = 110 - (100 + delta_initial) % 10`

So, the updated state is:

- `nums[i]` is `110 - (100 + delta_initial) % 10`
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`delta` is `10 - (100 + delta_initial) % 10`, `stop` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `-delta_initial`, `nums[i]` is `110 - (100 + delta_initial) % 10`, `i` is 1**
