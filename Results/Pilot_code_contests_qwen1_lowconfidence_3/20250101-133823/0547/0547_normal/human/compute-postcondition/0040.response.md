Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is unchanged, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `delta` is 10 - `nums[2] % 10`, `stop` is `False`. If `k` is less than `delta`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
