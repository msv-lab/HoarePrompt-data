The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since the `continue` statement is executed, the loop will continue its next iteration without executing any statements inside the current iteration. However, no variables are updated or affected by the `continue` statement itself.

Given the initial state and the fact that the `continue` statement does not modify any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`stop` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `-delta`, `nums[i]` is 100 + `delta`, `i` is 1.**
