First, let's understand the initial state and the code snippet:

- Initial State: `delta` is `10 - (100 + delta_initial) % 10`, `stop` is `False`, `n` is greater than `0`, `k` is `-delta_initial`, `nums[i]` is `110 - (100 + delta_initial) % 10`, `i` is `1`.
- Code Snippet: `k = k - delta`

Now, let's break down the code and its impact on the variables:

1. Calculate the initial value of `delta`:
   \[
   \text{delta} = 10 - (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10
   \]
   Let's denote \(\text{delta\_initial}\) as \(d_i\). Then,
   \[
   \text{delta} = 10 - (100 + d_i) \% 10
   \]

2. Calculate the initial value of `k`:
   \[
   k = -\text{delta\_initial} = -d_i
   \]

3. Update `k` using the code snippet:
   \[
   k = k - \text{delta} = -d_i - (10 - (100 + d_i) \% 10)
   \]

Let's simplify the expression for `k`:
   \[
   k = -d_i - 10 + (100 + d_i) \% 10
   \]
   Since \((100 + d_i) \% 10\) is the remainder when \(100 + d_i\) is divided by 10, it can take any value from 0 to 9 depending on the value of \(d_i\).

So, the updated value of `k` is:
   \[
   k = -d_i - 10 + (100 + d_i) \% 10
   \]

All other variables (`stop`, `n`, `nums[i]`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`delta` is `10 - (100 + delta_initial) % 10`, `stop` is `False`, `n` is greater than `0`, `k` is `-delta_initial - 10 + (100 + delta_initial) % 10`, `nums[i]` is `110 - (100 + delta_initial) % 10`, `i` is `1`.**
