The `break` statement does not modify any variables but indicates that the most internal loop or conditional statement is exited. Given the initial state, the variables remain unchanged after executing the `break` statement.

Output State: **`delta` is \(\text{delta\_initial} \% 10\), `stop` is `False`, `n` must be greater than `0`, `k` is \(-\text{delta\_initial} - 10 + (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\), `nums[2]` is \(110 - (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\), `i` is `2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
