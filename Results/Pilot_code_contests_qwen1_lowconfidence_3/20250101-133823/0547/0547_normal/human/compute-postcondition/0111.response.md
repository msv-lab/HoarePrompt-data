Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
     - `nums[i+1]` is updated to `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+1] + (10 - nums[i+1] % 10)`
     - `k` is `k - delta`
     - `stop` is `False`
     - `nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + delta`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(0, n)`.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range `[0, n-1]`.

3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n-1` (since the range is inclusive of 0 and exclusive of `n`).
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - `nums[i+1]` will be updated based on the value of `nums[i]` and `delta`.
   - `k` will be decremented by `delta`.
   - `stop` remains `False` unless explicitly set to `True` inside the loop body.
   - `nums[i]` will be updated based on the current value of `i`.

Given these points, at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the following states:
- Increment `i` by 1.
- Update `nums[i+1]` based on the new value of `nums[i]` and `delta`.
- Decrement `k` by `delta`.
- Ensure `stop` remains `False`.

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`nums[i+1]` is updated to `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+2] + (10 - nums[i+2] % 10)`, `k` is `k - delta`, `stop` is `False`, `nums[i+2]` is updated to `nums[i+2] + delta`**
