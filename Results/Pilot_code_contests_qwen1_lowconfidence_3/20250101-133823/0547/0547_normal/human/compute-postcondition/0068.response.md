Postcondition: ***`delta` is `10 - (100 + delta_initial) % 10`, `stop` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `-delta_initial`, `nums[i]` is `100 + delta_initial`, `i` is 1. If `k < delta`, the condition remains as is; otherwise, the condition remains unchanged since there is no else part specified.***
