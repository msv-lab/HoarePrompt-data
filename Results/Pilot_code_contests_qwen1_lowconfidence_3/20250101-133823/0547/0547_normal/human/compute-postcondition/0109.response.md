`nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + delta`. The original value of `nums[i+1]` was updated to `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+1] + (10 - nums[i+1] % 10)` and `k` was set based on whether `nums[i+1]` was 100. The value of `stop` remains `False`. Since `nums[i]` is now updated, its new value is `nums[i] + delta`.

Output State: **`nums[i+1]` is updated to `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+1] + (10 - nums[i+1] % 10)`, `k` is set to `0 - delta` if `nums[i+1]` was 100, otherwise `k` is `-delta`; `stop` is `False`, `nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + delta`.**
