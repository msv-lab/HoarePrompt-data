Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is unchanged, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `delta` is 0, `stop` is `False`. Since the condition `k == 0` is checked in the if statement and no modifications are made in either the if or else part other than the initial conditions, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
