The code `nums = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings. Since the initial values of `n` and `k` are integers, they are not affected by this operation. After executing this line of code, the `nums` variable is assigned the list of strings obtained from splitting the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `nums` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input**
