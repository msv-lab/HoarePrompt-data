The code sorts the list `nums` using a custom comparator that compares two elements `a` and `b` based on the last digit of their values (`b % 10` and `a % 10`). This means the list will be sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each element.

Given this, the output state after executing the code is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer.**
