`delta` is assigned the value `10 - nums[i] % 10`. Given that `nums[i]` is `100 + delta`, and since `delta` is a variable, let's denote the initial value of `delta` as `delta_initial`. Therefore, `nums[i]` is `100 + delta_initial`. The expression `nums[i] % 10` will give the remainder when `100 + delta_initial` is divided by 10. Since `100` ends in `0`, the remainder will depend solely on `delta_initial`.

Let's consider the value of `delta_initial`:

- If `delta_initial` is 0, then `nums[i] % 10` is 0, and `delta` becomes `10 - 0 = 10`.
- If `delta_initial` is 1, then `nums[i] % 10` is 1, and `delta` becomes `10 - 1 = 9`.
- If `delta_initial` is 2, then `nums[i] % 10` is 2, and `delta` becomes `10 - 2 = 8`.
- And so on...

In general, `delta` will be `10 - (100 + delta_initial) % 10`. However, since the exact value of `delta_initial` is not specified, we can only express `delta` in terms of `delta_initial`.

Given these considerations, the updated values are:
- `delta` is `10 - (100 + delta_initial) % 10`
- `stop` is still `False`
- `n` is still greater than 0
- `k` is still `-delta_initial`
- `nums[i]` is still `100 + delta_initial`
- `i` is still 1

Output State: **`delta` is `10 - (100 + delta_initial) % 10`, `stop` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `-delta_initial`, `nums[i]` is `100 + delta_initial`, `i` is 1**
