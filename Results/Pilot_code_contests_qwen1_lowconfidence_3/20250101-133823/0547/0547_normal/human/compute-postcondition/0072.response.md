Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `delta` is \(10 - (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\)
   - `stop` is `False`
   - `n` is greater than `0`
   - `k` is \(-\text{delta\_initial} - 10 + (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\)
   - `nums[i]` is \(110 - (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\)
   - `i` is `1`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop is defined as `for i in range(0, n)`.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently `1`, the loop will execute again if `i < n` is true.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by `1` at the start of the next iteration, so `i` will become `2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than `0`.
   - `delta`, `stop`, `k`, and `nums[i]` remain unchanged since they are not modified within the loop.

6. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `delta` is still \(10 - (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\)
   - `stop` is still `False`
   - `n` must still be greater than `0`
   - `k` is still \(-\text{delta\_initial} - 10 + (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\)
   - `nums[2]` is still \(110 - (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\) (since `nums[i]` does not change within the loop)
   - `i` is now `2`

Therefore, the adjusted state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`delta` is \(10 - (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\), `stop` is `False`, `n` must be greater than `0`, `k` is \(-\text{delta\_initial} - 10 + (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\), `nums[2]` is \(110 - (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\), `i` is `2`**
