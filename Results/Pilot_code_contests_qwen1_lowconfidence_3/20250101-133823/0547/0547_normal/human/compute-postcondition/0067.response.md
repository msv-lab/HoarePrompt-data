The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only breaks out of the current loop or block of code. Since there is no loop or block of code in the given snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`delta` is `10 - (100 + delta_initial) % 10`, `stop` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `-delta_initial`, `nums[i]` is `100 + delta_initial`, `i` is 1**
