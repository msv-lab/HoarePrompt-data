Postcondition: ***`delta` is \(10 - (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\), `stop` is `False`, `n` must be greater than `0`, `k` is \(-\text{delta\_initial} - 10 + (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\), `nums[2]` is \(110 - (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\), `i` is `2`. Since the condition `nums[i] == 100` is not met, no changes occur.***
