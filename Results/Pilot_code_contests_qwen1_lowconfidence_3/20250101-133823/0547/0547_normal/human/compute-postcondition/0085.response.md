`stop` is assigned the value `True`. This changes the value of `stop` from `False` to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `stop` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `nums[i]` for each `i` such that `0 <= i < n` is adjusted according to the rules inside the loop, `i` is `n-1`.

Output State: **`stop` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `nums[i]` for each `i` such that `0 <= i < n` is adjusted according to the rules inside the loop, `i` is `n-1`**
