Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `k` is either `0` or less than `0`, `nums[i]` for each `i` such that `0 <= i < n` is adjusted to the nearest multiple of 10, `n` is `0`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Operation**: The loop continues as long as `stop` is `False`. Inside the loop, there is a `for` loop that iterates over the list `nums` from index `0` to `n-1`.
   
2. **Break Conditions**:
   - If `k` becomes `0`, the loop breaks.
   - If the element `nums[i]` is `100`, it is skipped due to the `continue` statement.
   - If the difference between `10` and the last digit of `nums[i]` (`delta`) is greater than `k`, the loop breaks.

3. **Adjustment Process**:
   - When `delta` is less than or equal to `k`, `nums[i]` is adjusted to the nearest multiple of `10` by adding `delta` to it.
   - `k` is reduced by `delta`.
   - If `k` becomes `0` during any iteration, `stop` is set to `False` and the loop continues.

4. **Final State**:
   - Once `k` is `0` or no further adjustments can be made (i.e., all elements in `nums` are multiples of `10`), `stop` will eventually become `True` after the outer `while` loop checks its condition.
   - If `k` is `0`, it means all possible adjustments were made.
   - If `k` is less than `0`, it means not all elements could be adjusted to multiples of `10` because `k` was exhausted.
   - Since the `for` loop iterates through the entire list `nums`, `n` will be `0` once the loop exits, indicating that all elements have been processed.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - `stop` will be `True` after the loop completes.
   - `k` will be either `0` or less than `0`.
   - Each element in `nums` will be adjusted to the nearest multiple of `10`.
   - `n` will be `0` since all elements have been processed.
