To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and its behavior step-by-step.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Initial Values**: 
  - `stop` is `True`.
  - `n` is greater than 0.
  - `k` is `0`.
  - `nums[i]` for each `i` such that `0 <= i < n` is initially set to some value.
  - `i` starts at `n-1`.

- **Loop Condition**: 
  - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
  - If `k == 0`, the loop breaks immediately.
  - If `nums[i] == 100`, the loop skips this iteration using `continue`.
  - If `k < delta`, where `delta = 10 - nums[i] % 10`, the loop also breaks.
  - Otherwise, `stop` is set to `False`, `nums[i]` is updated, and `k` is decremented by `delta`.

### Observations from Example Output States:
- **After 1 Iteration**:
  - `nums[i]` becomes `nums[i] + (10 - nums[i] % 10)`.
  - `k` becomes `0 - delta` if `nums[i]` was 100, otherwise `k` is `-delta`.
  - `stop` is `False`.
  - The loop may break if `k` becomes non-positive.

- **After 2 Iterations**:
  - `nums[i+1]` becomes `nums[i+1] + (10 - nums[i+1] % 10)`.
  - `k` becomes `k - delta`.
  - `stop` is `False`.
  - `nums[i]` becomes `nums[i] + delta`.

- **After 3 Iterations**:
  - `nums[i]` becomes `nums[i] + delta`.
  - `nums[i+1]` becomes `nums[i+1] + (10 - nums[i+1] % 10)`.
  - `k` becomes `k - delta`.
  - `stop` is `False`.

### General Behavior:
- The loop iterates through `nums` starting from the last element (`i = n-1`) and works its way towards the beginning.
- If `k` becomes non-positive at any point, the loop breaks and `stop` is set to `True`.
- Each iteration updates `nums[i]` and decreases `k` by `delta` until either `k` becomes non-positive or `nums[i]` equals `100`.

### Final Output State:
- **If the loop completes all iterations**:
  - All elements in `nums` are adjusted such that `nums[i] % 10` becomes `0` (i.e., `nums[i]` is increased to the nearest multiple of `10`).
  - `k` will be `0` if all possible adjustments were made without breaking the loop.
  - `stop` will be `False`.

- **If the loop breaks early**:
  - `k` will be less than `0`.
  - Some elements in `nums` might not be fully adjusted.
  - `stop` will be `True`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`nums[i]` is adjusted to the nearest multiple of 10 for each `i` such that `0 <= i < n`, `k` is `0` if all possible adjustments were made, otherwise `k` is less than `0`, `stop` is `False` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `stop` is `True`.**
