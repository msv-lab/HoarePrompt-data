The code `nums[i] = nums[i] + delta` increments the value of `nums[i]` by `delta`. Given the initial state, the value of `nums[i]` is not explicitly stated, but it's known that if `nums[i]` is not equal to 100, `nums[i+2]` is updated to `nums[i+2] + delta`. Also, `nums[i+1]` is updated to `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+2] + (10 - nums[i+2] % 10)` and `k` is updated to `k - delta`. If `nums[i]` is 100, the state remains unchanged.

After executing the code `nums[i] = nums[i] + delta`, the value of `nums[i]` changes to its original value plus `delta`. However, since the exact value of `nums[i]` was not specified, we can only say that `nums[i]` is now `nums[i] + delta`.

The other variables `nums[i+1]`, `new_nums[i+1]`, `k`, and `stop` remain unchanged from their initial states because the code does not affect them directly.

Output State: **`nums[i]` is `nums[i] + delta`; `nums[i+1]` is updated to `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+2] + (10 - nums[i+2] % 10)`, `k` is updated to `k - delta`, `stop` is `False`. If `nums[i]` is not equal to 100, `nums[i+2]` is updated to `nums[i+2] + delta`. If `nums[i]` is 100, the state remains unchanged.**
