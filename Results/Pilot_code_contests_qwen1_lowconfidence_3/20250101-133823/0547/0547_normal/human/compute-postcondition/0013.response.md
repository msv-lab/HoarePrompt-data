The `continue` statement skips the rest of the loop body and moves to the next iteration of the loop. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, and `stop` is False. The current value of `nums[i]` is 100.**
