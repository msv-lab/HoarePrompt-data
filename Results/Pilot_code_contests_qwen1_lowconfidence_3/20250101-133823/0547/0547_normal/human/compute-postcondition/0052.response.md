The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop context, the `continue` statement does not affect any variable values and simply skips to the next iteration if it were part of a loop. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`stop` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is equal to 0, and the current value of `nums[i]` is 100**
