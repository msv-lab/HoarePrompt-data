Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The initial state includes:
   - `nums[i+1]` is updated to `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+1] + (10 - nums[i+1] % 10)`
   - `k` is set to `0 - delta` if `nums[i+1]` was 100, otherwise `k` is `-delta`
   - `stop` is `False`
   - `nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + delta`

2. The code snippet provided is `k = k - delta`. This means that the value of `k` is decreased by `delta`.

Since the initial state did not specify the exact values of `delta` or `nums[i+1]`, we will keep these as general variables.

3. After executing `k = k - delta`:
   - The value of `k` is now `k - delta` based on its initial value.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `nums[i+1]` remains unchanged from its initial state.
- `k` changes to `k - delta`.
- `stop` remains `False`.
- `nums[i]` remains unchanged from its initial state.

Output State: **`nums[i+1]` is updated to `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+1] + (10 - nums[i+1] % 10)`, `k` is `k - delta`, `stop` is `False`, `nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + delta`**
