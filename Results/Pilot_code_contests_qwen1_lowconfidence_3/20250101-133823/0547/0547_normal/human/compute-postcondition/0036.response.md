The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the execution does not change any variables or states. The only variables mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is unchanged, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `delta` is 0, `stop` is `False`.**
