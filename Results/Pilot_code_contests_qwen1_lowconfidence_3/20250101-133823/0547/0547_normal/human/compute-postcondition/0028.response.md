The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but indicates the exit from the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the only effect is the indication that we would exit the current loop or conditional block. 

Given the initial state, the variables remain unchanged except for the indication of breaking out of the loop or conditional block.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is less than `10 - nums[1] % 10`, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `delta` is `10 - nums[1] % 10`, and `stop` is `False`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
