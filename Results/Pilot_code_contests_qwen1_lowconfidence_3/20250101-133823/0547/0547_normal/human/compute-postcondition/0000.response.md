The code `n, k = raw_input().split()` takes a single line of input and splits it into two parts, assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. Since the input is split, `n` and `k` will be strings initially. However, the initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers, so the input should be converted to integers.

Given the initial state where `n` and `k` are integers, the code will convert the input strings back to integers, but since the input is expected to be integers, we'll treat the input as such during the execution.

The output state after running the code is:
- `n` and `k` are now the integers from the input, assuming the input is provided correctly as integers.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the integers from the input**
