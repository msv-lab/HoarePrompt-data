According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is currently 0.
- `k` is less than `delta`.
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer.
- `delta` is calculated as `10 - (original_nums_0 + delta)`.
- `stop` is `False`.
- `k` is decreased by `delta`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` must be greater than 0, the condition `i < n` is satisfied.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. 

Additionally, since `k` is decreased by `delta`, `k` will still be less than `delta` assuming `k` was already less than `delta` initially.

The state of `stop` remains `False`, and the state of `nums` and `delta` remain unchanged as no operations on these variables are mentioned within the loop body.

Therefore, the updated states are:

- `i` is now 1.
- `k` is still less than `delta`.
- The conditions for `n`, `stop`, `nums`, and `delta` remain the same.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is less than delta, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `delta` is 10 - (`original_nums_0` + delta), and `stop` is `False`.**
