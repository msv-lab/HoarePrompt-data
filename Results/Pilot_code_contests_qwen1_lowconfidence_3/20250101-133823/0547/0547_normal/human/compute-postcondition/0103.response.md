The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, the given code does not specify which loop this `continue` statement belongs to. Since the loop structure is not provided, we will assume that the `continue` statement is within a loop that is iterating over `nums` and checking the condition related to `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `nums[i+1]` is updated to `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+1] + (10 - nums[i+1] % 10)`
- `k` is `0 - delta` if `nums[i+1]` was 100, otherwise `k` is `-delta`
- `stop` remains `False` since there is no change in the if part and no else part to alter these conditions.

Since the `continue` statement does not change the value of `nums[i+1]`, `k`, or `stop`, and it simply skips the rest of the current iteration, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums[i+1]` is updated to `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+1] + (10 - nums[i+1] % 10)`, `k` is `0 - delta` if `nums[i+1]` was 100, otherwise `k` is `-delta`; `stop` remains `False`.**
