The `break` statement does not modify any variable values; it only breaks out of the nearest loop or match-case structure. Since there is no loop or match-case structure in the given code, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`stop` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `-delta`, `nums[i]` is 100 + `delta`, `i` is 1**
