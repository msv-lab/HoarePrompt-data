The code calculates the remainder of `nums[i]` when divided by 10 and subtracts it from 10 to find `delta`. Given the initial state, `nums[i]` is specifically 100. 

- The remainder of 100 when divided by 10 is 0.
- Therefore, `delta` is calculated as `10 - 0`, which results in `delta` being 10.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet. The preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`stop` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is equal to 0, `nums[i]` is 100, and `delta` is 10.**
