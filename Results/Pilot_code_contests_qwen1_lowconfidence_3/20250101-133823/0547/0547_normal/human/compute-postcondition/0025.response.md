The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since the code does not affect any variable values or change the conditions given, the only change is that the loop or conditional block will continue with the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is less than delta, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `delta` is 10 - (`original_nums_0` + delta), and `stop` is `False`. We continue with the next iteration of the loop or conditional block.**
