`stop` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `n`, `k`, `nums`, and the condition for `stop` being False are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is True**
