The code `nums[i] = nums[i] + delta` updates the value of `nums[i]` by adding `delta` to its current value. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10`
- If `nums[i]` is 100, then `k` is 0, otherwise `k` remains unchanged
- `stop` is False
- We break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` is less than `delta`

After executing the code, the new value of `nums[i]` will be `nums[i] + delta`. Since `delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10`, we can express `nums[i]` as `nums[i] + (10 - nums[i] % 10)`.

Let's break it down:
- If `nums[i]` is 100, `delta` is `10 - 0` which is 10, so `nums[i]` becomes 110 and `k` remains 0.
- Otherwise, `nums[i]` becomes `nums[i] + (10 - nums[i] % 10)`.

Since the exact value of `nums[i]` is not specified, let's denote the updated value of `nums[i]` as `new_nums[i] = nums[i] + (10 - nums[i] % 10)`. The value of `k` remains unchanged unless `nums[i]` was 100, in which case `k` becomes 0.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`nums[i]` is `new_nums[i] = nums[i] + (10 - nums[i] % 10)`, `k` is 0 if `nums[i]` was 100, otherwise `k` remains unchanged; `stop` is False; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` is less than `new_nums[i] - nums[i]`.**
