The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, it does not change the values of any variables; it only affects the flow control. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `nums[i+1]` is updated to `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+2] + (10 - nums[i+2] % 10)`
- `k` is `k - delta`
- `stop` is `False`
- `nums[i+2]` is updated to `nums[i+2] + delta`
- If `k == 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.

Since `continue` does not alter the values of the variables but instead skips to the next iteration, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums[i+1]` is updated to `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+2] + (10 - nums[i+2] % 10)`, `k` is `k - delta`, `stop` is `False`, `nums[i+2]` is updated to `nums[i+2] + delta`**
