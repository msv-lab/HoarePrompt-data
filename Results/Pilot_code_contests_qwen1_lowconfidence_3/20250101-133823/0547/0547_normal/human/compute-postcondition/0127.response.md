The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 10^7\). Additionally, the function takes a list `ai` which is a list of `n` integers, each satisfying \(0 \leq ai \leq 100\).

Case_1: The function returns the sum of all elements in the list `ai`.
Case_2: The function returns the maximum element in the list `ai`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept parameters `n`, `k`, and a list `ai` and return either the sum of all elements in the list `ai` or the maximum element in the list `ai`, depending on the conditions specified.
