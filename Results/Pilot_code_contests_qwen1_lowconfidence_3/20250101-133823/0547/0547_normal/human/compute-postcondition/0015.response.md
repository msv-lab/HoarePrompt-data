`delta` is assigned the value of `10 - nums[i] % 10`. Since `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, and `nums[i]` is not specifically 100 (as per the initial condition), the calculation of `delta` will proceed without any changes to the conditions stated for the other variables.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `delta` is 10 - `nums[0] % 10`, and `stop` is False.**
