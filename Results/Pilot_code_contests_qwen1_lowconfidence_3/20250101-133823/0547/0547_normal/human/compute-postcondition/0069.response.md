The code sets `stop` to `False`. This does not change the values of the other variables, so they remain as per the initial state.

Output State: **`delta` is `10 - (100 + delta_initial) % 10`, `stop` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `-delta_initial`, `nums[i]` is `100 + delta_initial`, `i` is 1**
