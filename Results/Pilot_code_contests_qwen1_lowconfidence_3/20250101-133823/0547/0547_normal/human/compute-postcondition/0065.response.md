Postcondition: ***`stop` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `-delta`, `nums[i]` is 100 + `delta`, `i` is 1. If `nums[i]` equals 100, then `stop` remains False, `n` remains greater than 0, `k` remains `-delta`, and `i` remains 1. Since there is no else part, the state does not change regardless of the condition check.***
