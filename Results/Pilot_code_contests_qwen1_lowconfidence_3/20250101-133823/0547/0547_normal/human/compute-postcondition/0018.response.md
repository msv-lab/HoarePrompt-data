Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is less than delta, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `delta` is 10 - `nums[0] % 10`, and `stop` is False. If `k` < delta, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the state remains unchanged otherwise.***
