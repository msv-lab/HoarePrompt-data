`nums[i]` is updated by adding `delta` to its current value. Given that `i` is 2, `nums[i]` refers to the third element in the list `nums`. Also, `delta` is calculated as `10 - nums[2] % 10`. Since `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, and `n` must be greater than 2, we know the initial last digit of `nums[2]` is a digit between 0 and 9 (inclusive). However, the exact value of `nums[2]` is not specified, so we keep it as `nums[2]`.

After the operation, `nums[2]` becomes `nums[2] + delta`. Since `delta` is `10 - nums[2] % 10`, we can substitute this into the equation for `nums[2]`:

- Let's denote the last digit of `nums[2]` as `d`, where `d = nums[2] % 10`.
- Then, `delta = 10 - d`.
- After the operation, `nums[2]` becomes `nums[2] + (10 - d)`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is unchanged, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `nums[2]` is `nums[2] + (10 - nums[2] % 10)`, `delta` is 10 - `nums[2] % 10`, `stop` is `False`.**
