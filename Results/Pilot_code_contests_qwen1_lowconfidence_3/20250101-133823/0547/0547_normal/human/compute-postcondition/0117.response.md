The `break` statement is encountered, which means it breaks out of the loop or conditional structure it is in. However, the code provided does not specify the context in which this `break` statement is placed. Given the initial conditions and the fact that the `break` statement does not modify any variables, the only changes that occur are due to the existing conditions before the `break` statement.

Here are the steps:

1. `nums[i+1]` is updated to `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+2] + (10 - nums[i+2] % 10)`.
2. `k` is updated to `k - delta`.
3. `stop` is set to `False`.
4. `nums[i+2]` is updated to `nums[i+2] + delta` if `nums[i]` is not equal to 100. If `nums[i]` is 100, the postcondition remains unchanged.
5. The `break` statement does not affect any of these updates.

Since the `break` statement does not change any of the variables mentioned in the initial state, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`nums[i+1]` is updated to `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+2] + (10 - nums[i+2] % 10)`, `k` is `k - delta`, `stop` is `False`, `nums[i+2]` is updated to `nums[i+2] + delta` if `nums[i]` is not equal to 100, otherwise it remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
