The variable `stop` is assigned the value `False`, but the initial value of `stop` was `False`. Since the value of `stop` does not change from its initial state, the only variable that changes is `stop`, which is now explicitly set to `False`.

Output State: **`nums[i+1]` is updated to `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+1] + (10 - nums[i+1] % 10)`, `k` is set to `0 - delta` if `nums[i+1]` was 100, otherwise `k` is `-delta`; `stop` is `False`.**
