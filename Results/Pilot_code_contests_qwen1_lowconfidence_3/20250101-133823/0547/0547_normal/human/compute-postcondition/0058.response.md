The code `stop = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `stop`. The value of `stop` was already `False` in the initial state, so it remains unchanged. All other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`stop` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `nums[i]` is 100**
