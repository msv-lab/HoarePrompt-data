The code sets the variable `stop` to `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of `delta`, `nums[i]`, `k`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of `stop`.

Output State: **`delta` is 10 - `nums[i]` % 10; if `nums[i]` is 100, then `k` is 0, otherwise `k` remains unchanged; `stop` is False; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` is less than `delta`.**
