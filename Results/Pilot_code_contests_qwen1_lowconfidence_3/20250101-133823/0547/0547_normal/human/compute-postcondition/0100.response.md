Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the Current State:**
   - `nums[i]` is set to `new_nums[i] = nums[i] + (10 - nums[i] % 10)`.
   - `k` is `0 - delta` if `nums[i]` was 100, otherwise `k` is `-delta`.
   - `stop` is `False`.
   - The loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` is less than `new_nums[i] - nums[i]`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - The value of `i` will increment by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` will increment by 1, `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - `nums[i]` will be updated based on the formula `new_nums[i] = nums[i] + (10 - nums[i] % 10)`.
   - `k` will be recalculated based on the new value of `nums[i]`.
   - `stop` remains `False` unless it is set to `True` within the loop body.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `nums[i]` will be updated according to the formula.
- `k` will be recalculated based on the new value of `nums[i]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`nums[i+1]` is `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+1] + (10 - nums[i+1] % 10)`, `k` is `0 - delta` if `nums[i+1]` was 100, otherwise `k` is `-delta`; `stop` is `False`**.
