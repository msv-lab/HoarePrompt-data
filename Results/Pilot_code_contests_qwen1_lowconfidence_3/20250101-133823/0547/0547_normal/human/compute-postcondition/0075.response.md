The `continue` statement in the given code does not affect any variable values directly; it only skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop if the condition `k == 0` is not met. Since the initial state does not specify a loop or the condition `k == 0`, the `continue` statement will be executed without affecting any variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`delta` is \(10 - (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\), `stop` is `False`, `n` must be greater than `0`, `k` is \(-\text{delta\_initial} - 10 + (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\), `nums[2]` is \(110 - (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\), `i` is `2`**
