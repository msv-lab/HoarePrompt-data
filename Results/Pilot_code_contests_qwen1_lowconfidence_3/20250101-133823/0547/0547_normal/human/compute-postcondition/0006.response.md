To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop, which is `not stop`. For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `not stop` must evaluate to `True` initially.

Let's break it down:

1. The loop condition is `not stop`.
2. The current state of `stop` is `False`.

Since `stop` is currently `False`, the condition `not stop` is already `True`. Therefore, no adjustment to any of the given states (`n`, `k`, `nums`, or `stop`) is required for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is False**
