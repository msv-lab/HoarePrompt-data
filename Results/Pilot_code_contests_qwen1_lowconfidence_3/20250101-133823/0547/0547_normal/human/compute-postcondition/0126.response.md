### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Initial State
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq 10^7\).
- `ai` (referred to as `nums` in the code) is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq \text{ai} \leq 100\).

#### Code Execution in the `try` Block
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - `n, k = raw_input().split()`: This line attempts to split the input into two strings.
   - `n, k = int(n), int(k)`: These lines convert the split strings into integers.
   - `nums = raw_input().split()`: This line reads another line of input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - `nums = [int(num) for num in nums]`: Converts the list of strings to a list of integers.

2. **Sorting:**
   - `nums.sort(cmp=lambda a, b: b % 10 - a % 10)`: Sorts the list `nums` based on the last digit of each number in descending order.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop runs until `stop` becomes `True`.
   - For each index `i` in `nums`, if `k` is zero, the loop breaks.
   - If the current element `nums[i]` is 100, the loop continues to the next iteration.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the difference between 10 and the last digit of `nums[i]` (`delta`).
   - If `k` is less than `delta`, the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, `nums[i]` is increased by `delta`, and `k` is decreased by `delta`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The sum of the quotients when each element in `nums` is divided by 10 is printed.

#### Exception Handling
- **Exception Type:** `IOError`
- **Condition:** The `IOError` can occur if there is an issue with reading from the input stream (e.g., end of file, invalid input format).

#### Output State Summary
- **Normal Execution:**
  - After sorting and adjusting the numbers in `nums`, the final state includes `stop` being `True`, `k` being `0` or less than `0`, and `nums[i]` for each `i` adjusted to the nearest multiple of 10.
  - The function prints the sum of the quotients when each element in `nums` is divided by 10.

- **Exception Execution:**
  - If an `IOError` occurs, the state of the variables `n`, `k`, and `nums` is unknown because the code inside the `try` block is not executed.
  - The `except` block handles the `IOError` by simply passing over it without any specific action, meaning the state remains unknown.

### Final Output State

**Output State:** **`n` and `k` are integers, `nums` is a list of integers, `stop` is `True`, `k` is either `0` or less than `0`, and `nums[i]` for each `i` such that `0 <= i < n` is adjusted to the nearest multiple of 10. If an `IOError` occurs, the state of the variables is unknown.**
