First, let's break down the initial state and the given code step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- `nums[i+1]` is updated to `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+2] + (10 - nums[i+2] % 10)`
- `k` is `k - delta`
- `stop` is `False`
- `nums[i+2]` is updated to `nums[i+2] + delta`
- These updates occur if and only if `nums[i]` is not equal to 100. If `nums[i]` is 100, the postcondition remains unchanged as there is no further action within the if block.

### Given Code:
```python
delta = 10 - nums[i] % 10
```

This code calculates the value of `delta` based on the value of `nums[i]`. However, this does not perform any updates to the variables mentioned in the initial state. It only assigns a new value to `delta`.

Since the code does not actually perform the updates described in the initial state (it only calculates `delta`), the initial state remains unchanged.

### Output State:
Output State: **`nums[i+1]` is updated to `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+2] + (10 - nums[i+2] % 10)`, `k` is `k - delta`, `stop` is `False`, `nums[i+2]` is updated to `nums[i+2] + delta` if `nums[i]` is not equal to 100. If `nums[i]` is 100, the postcondition remains unchanged as there is no further action within the if block.**
