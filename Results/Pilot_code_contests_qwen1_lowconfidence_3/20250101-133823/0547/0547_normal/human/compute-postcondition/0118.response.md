Postcondition: ***`nums[i+1]` is updated to `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+2] + (10 - nums[i+2] % 10)`, `k` is updated to `k - delta`, `stop` is `False`. If `nums[i]` is not equal to 100, `nums[i+2]` is updated to `nums[i+2] + delta`. If `nums[i]` is 100, the state remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
