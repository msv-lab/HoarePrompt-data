`continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop but does not change the values of variables. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the execution of `continue` does not affect any variable values. The only condition mentioned in the initial state is that if `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or match case, but this condition is not relevant here since no loop or match case is involved.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`k` is an integer, and if `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or match case. `nums[i]` equals 100.**
