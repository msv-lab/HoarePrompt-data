According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the condition `n > 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `stop` is `False`, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `-delta`, and `nums[i]` is 100 + `delta`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `i` must be incremented by 1.
2. The condition `n > 0` must still hold true.

Given that `i` was used in the last iteration and assuming it started from 0 (as per the loop range), `i` would now be 0 if it just started or would be 1 if it just finished its first iteration. For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 1, and `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, we need to update the state as follows:

State: **`stop` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `-delta`, `nums[i]` is 100 + `delta`, `i` is 1**
