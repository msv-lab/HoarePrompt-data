The code `break` is used to exit a loop, but since there is no loop in the given code snippet, it simply exits whatever block it was inside. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `k`, `nums`, `delta`, and `stop` remain unchanged. The only specific change is that the block containing this line of code is exited.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is unchanged, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `delta` is 0, `stop` is `False`.**
