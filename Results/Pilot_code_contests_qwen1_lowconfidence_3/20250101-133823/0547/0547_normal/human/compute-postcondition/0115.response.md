Postcondition: ***`nums[i+1]` is updated to `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+2] + (10 - nums[i+2] % 10)`, `k` is `k - delta`, `stop` is `False`, `nums[i+2]` is updated to `nums[i+2] + delta`. These updates occur if and only if `nums[i]` is not equal to 100. If `nums[i]` is 100, the postcondition remains unchanged as there is no further action within the if block.***
