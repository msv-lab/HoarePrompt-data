The code `break` does not change the values of any variables; it simply exits the loop or the most nested block it is in. Since the question does not specify which loop or block we are breaking out of, we will assume it is exiting the loop or block it is currently in.

The initial state is:
- `delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10`
- If `nums[i]` is 100, then `k` is 0, otherwise `k` remains unchanged.
- The current value of `k` is less than `delta`.

After executing `break`, the states of the variables remain the same because `break` does not modify any variable values. The only thing that changes is that we exit the current loop or block.

Output State: **`delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10`; if `nums[i]` is 100, then `k` is 0, otherwise `k` remains unchanged; the current value of `k` is less than `delta`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
