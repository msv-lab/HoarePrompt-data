`delta` is calculated as `delta_initial % 10`, and then `k` is updated to be `k - delta`. Given that `k` is initially `-10`, `delta` is a value between `0` and `9` (inclusive), depending on `delta_initial % 10`. After updating `k`, the new value of `k` will be `-10 - delta`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`delta` is `delta_initial % 10`, `stop` is `False`, `n` must be greater than `0`, `k` is `-10 - delta`, `nums[2]` is `10`, `i` is `2`**
