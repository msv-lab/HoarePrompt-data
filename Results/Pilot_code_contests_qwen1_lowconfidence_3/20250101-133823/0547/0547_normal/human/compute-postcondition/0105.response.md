The code calculates `delta` as `10 - nums[i] % 10`. This does not affect `nums[i+1]`, `k`, or `stop`. Therefore, the output state will keep the values of `nums[i+1]`, `k`, and `stop` as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`nums[i+1]` is updated to `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+1] + (10 - nums[i+1] % 10)`, `k` is set to `0 - delta` if `nums[i+1]` was 100, otherwise `k` is `-delta`; `stop` remains `False`.**
