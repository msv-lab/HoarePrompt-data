Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is less than `10 - nums[1] % 10`, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `delta` is `10 - nums[1] % 10`, and `stop` is `False`. If `k < delta`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part specified, so the postcondition remains unchanged for other cases.***
