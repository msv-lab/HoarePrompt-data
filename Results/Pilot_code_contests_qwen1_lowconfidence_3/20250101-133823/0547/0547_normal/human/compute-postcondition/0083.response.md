Output State: **`stop` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `nums[i]` for each `i` such that `0 <= i < n` is adjusted according to the rules inside the loop, `i` is `n-1`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Conditions and Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For each iteration, if `k == 0`, the loop breaks immediately.
   - If `nums[i] == 100`, the loop continues without modifying `k` or updating `nums[i]`.
   - Otherwise, the loop calculates `delta` as `10 - nums[i] % 10`.
   - If `k < delta`, the loop also breaks.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, `stop` is set to `False`, `nums[i]` is updated by adding `delta` to its value, and `k` is decreased by `delta`.

2. **Loop Termination**:
   - The loop will continue to execute until either `k == 0` or `nums[i] == 100` for all elements, or `k < delta` for an element.
   - Since the loop updates `k` by subtracting `delta`, eventually `k` will reach `0` if the conditions allow it to run through all iterations.

3. **Final State Analysis**:
   - After all iterations, `stop` will be `False` because the loop will only exit when `k == 0` and `stop` is explicitly set to `False` in each iteration.
   - `n` must be greater than `0` for the loop to execute at least once.
   - `k` will be `0` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking due to `k < delta`.
   - `nums[i]` will be adjusted based on the rule `nums[i] = nums[i] + delta` for each `i` such that `0 <= i < n`.
   - The final value of `i` will be `n-1` because the loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`.

4. **Non-Execution Case**:
   - If the loop does not execute (e.g., if `n == 0`), then `stop` remains `True`, `k` remains `0`, and `nums` remains unchanged.

This comprehensive state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has completed its iterations.
