The code `break` does not affect any variable values and simply breaks out of the nearest loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code snippet, it implies that the `break` statement is not affecting any variables and the program would continue executing the next line of code outside this snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `delta` is \(10 - (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\)
- `stop` is `False`
- `n` must be greater than `0`
- `k` is \(-\text{delta\_initial} - 10 + (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\)
- `nums[2]` is \(110 - (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\)
- `i` is `2`

Since the `break` statement does not change any of these values, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`delta` is \(10 - (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\), `stop` is `False`, `n` must be greater than `0`, `k` is \(-\text{delta\_initial} - 10 + (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\), `nums[2]` is \(110 - (100 + \text{delta\_initial}) \% 10\), `i` is `2`**
