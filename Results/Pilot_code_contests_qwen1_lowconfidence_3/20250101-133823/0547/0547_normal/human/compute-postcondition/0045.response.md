According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `stop`. If `stop` is `False`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `stop` was `False`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed because the condition `not stop` is still satisfied.

State: **`stop` is False**
