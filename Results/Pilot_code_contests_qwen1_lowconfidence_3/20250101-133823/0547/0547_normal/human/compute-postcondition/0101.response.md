The code `break` is used to exit a loop or the most nested block it is inside. In this case, since there is no loop or nested block affecting the variables `nums`, `k`, and `stop`, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums[i+1]` is `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+1] + (10 - nums[i+1] % 10)`, `k` is `0 - delta` if `nums[i+1]` was 100, otherwise `k` is `-delta`; `stop` is `False`**
