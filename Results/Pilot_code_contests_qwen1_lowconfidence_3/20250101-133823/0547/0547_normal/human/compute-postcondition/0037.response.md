Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is unchanged, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `delta` is 0, `stop` is `False`. If `nums[i]` equals 100, the condition remains unchanged. Since there is no modification in the else part and no else condition is provided, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
