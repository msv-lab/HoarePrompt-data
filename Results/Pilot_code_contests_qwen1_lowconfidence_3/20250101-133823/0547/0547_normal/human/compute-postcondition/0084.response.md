According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `stop`. If `stop` is `False`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `stop` is `False`, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, and `nums[i]` for each `i` such that `0 <= i < n` has been adjusted according to the rules inside the loop. The only condition that needs to be ensured for the loop to execute one more time is that `stop` remains `False`.

Since no other conditions are specified as necessary for the loop to continue, we don't need to adjust any additional states.

State: **`stop` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `nums[i]` for each `i` such that `0 <= i < n` is adjusted according to the rules inside the loop, `i` is `n-1`**
