The code updates the value of `delta` to `10 - nums[i] % 10`. Here, `nums[i] % 10` gives the last digit of `nums[i]`, and `10 - nums[i] % 10` calculates the difference between 10 and this last digit. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `k` is less than `delta`
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer
- `delta` is calculated as `10 - original_nums_0 % 10`, where `original_nums_0` is the first element of `nums`
- `stop` is `False`

After executing the line `delta = 10 - nums[i] % 10`, the new value of `delta` is `10 - nums[1] % 10`. The value of `i` remains 1, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is less than `10 - nums[1] % 10`, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `delta` is `10 - nums[1] % 10`, and `stop` is `False`.**
