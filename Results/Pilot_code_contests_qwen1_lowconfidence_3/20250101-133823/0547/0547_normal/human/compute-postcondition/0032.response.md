`k` is assigned the value of `k - delta`. The value of `delta` is `10 - nums[1] % 10`, and since `nums[1]` is updated to `nums[1] + (10 - nums[1] % 10)`, the new value of `nums[1]` is such that its last digit is now 0, making `delta` 0. Therefore, `k` becomes `k - 0`, which means `k` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is unchanged, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `delta` is 0, `stop` is `False`, `nums[1]` is updated to `nums[1] + (10 - nums[1] % 10)**
