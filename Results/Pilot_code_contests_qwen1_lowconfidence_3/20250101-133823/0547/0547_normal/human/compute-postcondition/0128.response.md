Functionality: **The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 10^7\). Additionally, the function takes a list `nums` which is a list of `n` integers, each satisfying \(0 \leq nums[i] \leq 100\). The function sorts the list `nums` in descending order based on the last digit of each number modulo 10. It then iteratively increases the value of each element in `nums` to the nearest multiple of 10, using up to `k` units of change. If `k` becomes zero or negative before processing all elements, the function stops early. After the adjustments, the function prints the sum of the elements in the modified list `nums`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is as follows:
- `nums` is a list of integers where each element is rounded to the nearest multiple of 10.
- `k` is either `0` or a negative integer, indicating the remaining change units.
- The function prints the sum of the elements in the modified list `nums`.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `k` is initially `0` or if all elements in `nums` are already multiples of 10, no changes are made, and the sum of the original list is printed.
- If `k` is sufficient to round up all elements to the next multiple of 10, the list `nums` will have all elements as multiples of 10, and the function will print their sum.
- The function does not handle cases where `nums` contains values outside the range \(0 \leq nums[i] \leq 100\). Such inputs would cause an error in the conversion to integers.**

This summary covers the actual behavior of the function based on the provided code and includes relevant edge cases and missing functionality.
