The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `nums[i+1]` or `k`. It only breaks out of the current loop or block of code. Since there are no further operations on `nums[i+1]` or `k` after the `break`, their values remain unchanged. The state of `stop` also remains `False`.

Output State: **`nums[i+1]` is updated to `new_nums[i+1] = nums[i+1] + (10 - nums[i+1] % 10)`, `k` is set to `0 - delta` if `nums[i+1]` was 100, otherwise `k` is `-delta`; `stop` remains `False`. We break out of the most internal loop or block of code.**
