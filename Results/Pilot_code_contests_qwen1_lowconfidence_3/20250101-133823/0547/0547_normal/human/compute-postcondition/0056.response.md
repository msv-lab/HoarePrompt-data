The `break` statement is used to exit a loop, but since there is no loop in this code snippet, it does not change any variable values. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`stop` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is equal to 0, `nums[i]` is 100, and `k` is less than 10.**
