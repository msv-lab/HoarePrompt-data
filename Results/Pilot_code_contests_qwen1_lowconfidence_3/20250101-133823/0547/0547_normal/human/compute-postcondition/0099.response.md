`k` is decremented by `delta`. The value of `delta` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `k`. However, we know that `k` was initially 0 if `nums[i]` was 100, otherwise `k` remained unchanged. After this operation, `k` is decreased by `delta`.

Output State: **`nums[i]` is `new_nums[i] = nums[i] + (10 - nums[i] % 10)`, `k` is `0 - delta` if `nums[i]` was 100, otherwise `k` is `-delta`; `stop` is False; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` is less than `new_nums[i] - nums[i]`.**
