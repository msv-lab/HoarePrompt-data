The code `nums = [int(num) for num in nums]` iterates over each element in the list `nums`, converts each element from a string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list back to `nums`. This means that `nums` will now contain integers instead of strings.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial State**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `nums` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
2. **Code Execution**: Each string in `nums` is converted to an integer using the `int()` function, and the updated list is assigned back to `nums`.
3. **Result**: After executing the code, `nums` will contain integers, while `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers**
