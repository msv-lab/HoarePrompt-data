`k` is decremented by `delta`. The initial value of `k` is `0`, so after subtracting `delta`, the value of `k` becomes `-delta`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `stop` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `-delta`, `nums[i]` is 100 + `delta`.

Output State: **`stop` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `-delta`, `nums[i]` is 100 + `delta`**
