You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Petya loves computer games. Finally a game that he's been waiting for so long came out!

The main character of this game has n different skills, each of which is characterized by an integer ai from 0 to 100. The higher the number ai is, the higher is the i-th skill of the character. The total rating of the character is calculated as the sum of the values ​​of <image> for all i from 1 to n. The expression ⌊ x⌋ denotes the result of rounding the number x down to the nearest integer.

At the beginning of the game Petya got k improvement units as a bonus that he can use to increase the skills of his character and his total rating. One improvement unit can increase any skill of Petya's character by exactly one. For example, if a4 = 46, after using one imporvement unit to this skill, it becomes equal to 47. A hero's skill cannot rise higher more than 100. Thus, it is permissible that some of the units will remain unused.

Your task is to determine the optimal way of using the improvement units so as to maximize the overall rating of the character. It is not necessary to use all the improvement units.

Input

The first line of the input contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ k ≤ 107) — the number of skills of the character and the number of units of improvements at Petya's disposal.

The second line of the input contains a sequence of n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100), where ai characterizes the level of the i-th skill of the character.

Output

The first line of the output should contain a single non-negative integer — the maximum total rating of the character that Petya can get using k or less improvement units.

99 100


Output

20

Note

In the first test case the optimal strategy is as follows. Petya has to improve the first skill to 10 by spending 3 improvement units, and the second skill to 10, by spending one improvement unit. Thus, Petya spends all his improvement units and the total rating of the character becomes equal to  lfloor frac{100}{10} rfloor + lfloor frac{100}{10} rfloor = 10 + 10 =  20.

In the second test the optimal strategy for Petya is to improve the first skill to 20 (by spending 3 improvement units) and to improve the third skill to 20 (in this case by spending 1 improvement units). Thus, Petya is left with 4 improvement units and he will be able to increase the second skill to 19 (which does not change the overall rating, so Petya does not necessarily have to do it). Therefore, the highest possible total rating in this example is <image>.

In the third test case the optimal strategy for Petya is to increase the first skill to 100 by spending 1 improvement unit. Thereafter, both skills of the character will be equal to 100, so Petya will not be able to spend the remaining improvement unit. So the answer is equal to <image>. 
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^7. The list ai is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ ai ≤ 100.
def func():
    try:
        n, k = raw_input().split()
        n, k = int(n), int(k)
        nums = raw_input().split()
        nums = [int(num) for num in nums]
        nums.sort(cmp=lambda a, b: b % 10 - a % 10)
        stop = False
        while not stop:
            stop = True
            
            for i in range(0, n):
                if k == 0:
                    break
                if nums[i] == 100:
                    continue
                delta = 10 - nums[i] % 10
                if k < delta:
                    break
                stop = False
                nums[i] = nums[i] + delta
                k = k - delta
            
        #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `stop` is `True`, `k` is either `0` or less than `0`, `nums[i]` for each `i` such that `0 <= i < n` is adjusted to the nearest multiple of 10, `n` is `0`.
        print(sum([(num / 10) for num in nums]))
    except (IOError):
        pass
    #State of the program after the try-except block has been executed: 
#Overall this is what the function does:- If `k` is initially `0` or if all elements in `nums` are already multiples of 10, no changes are made, and the sum of the original list is printed.
- If `k` is sufficient to round up all elements to the next multiple of 10, the list `nums` will have all elements as multiples of 10, and the function will print their sum.
- The function does not handle cases where `nums` contains values outside the range \(0 \leq nums[i] \leq 100\). Such inputs would cause an error in the conversion to integers.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
