Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not handle the case where the value of a skill is greater than or equal to 90 but less than 100. In such cases, the code only checks if the value is a multiple of 10 and does not consider the possibility of rounding up to the next multiple of 10 with the available improvement units. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 8
17 89 19
```

The expected output should be 5 because:
- Increase the first skill from 17 to 20 (using 3 improvement units).
- Increase the third skill from 19 to 20 (using 1 improvement unit).
- Use the remaining 4 improvement units to increase the second skill from 89 to 90 (no additional benefit since 90 is already the next multiple of 10).

However, the current code will only round up the second skill to 90, leaving 4 improvement units unused, resulting in a lower total rating. 

To fix this, the code needs to check if a skill is between 90 and 99 and round it up to 100 if possible with the remaining improvement units. This ensures that all possible improvements are made to maximize the total rating.
