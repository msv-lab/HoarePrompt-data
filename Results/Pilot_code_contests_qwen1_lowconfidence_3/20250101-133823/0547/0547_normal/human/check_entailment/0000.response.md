Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the total rating of the character. Specifically, the sorting logic and the way the improvement units are applied do not align with the problem description.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
3 8
17 15 19
```

According to the problem description, the optimal strategy is to:
1. Improve the first skill (17) to 20 (3 units).
2. Improve the third skill (19) to 20 (1 unit).

This would result in the skills being `[20, 15, 20]`, and the total rating would be `2 * 10 + 1 * 5 = 25`.

However, the provided program sorts the skills based on the last digit and then increments them, which might not always yield the optimal solution. For example, if the input is:

```
3 8
17 15 19
```

The program sorts the skills as `[19, 17, 15]` and then starts incrementing from the smallest last digit. This could potentially lead to suboptimal results, as it does not consider the global impact on the total rating.

Therefore, the program does not guarantee the correct solution for all inputs, making it incorrect.
