- If `k` is initially `0` or if all elements in `nums` are already multiples of 10, no changes are made, and the sum of the original list is printed.
- If `k` is sufficient to round up all elements to the next multiple of 10, the list `nums` will have all elements as multiples of 10, and the function will print their sum.
- The function does not handle cases where `nums` contains values outside the range \(0 \leq nums[i] \leq 100\). Such inputs would cause an error in the conversion to integers.
