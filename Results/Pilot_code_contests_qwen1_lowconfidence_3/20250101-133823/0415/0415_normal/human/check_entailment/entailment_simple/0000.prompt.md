You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A tree is an undirected connected graph without cycles.

Let's consider a rooted undirected tree with n vertices, numbered 1 through n. There are many ways to represent such a tree. One way is to create an array with n integers p1, p2, ..., pn, where pi denotes a parent of vertex i (here, for convenience a root is considered its own parent).

<image> For this rooted tree the array p is [2, 3, 3, 2].

Given a sequence p1, p2, ..., pn, one is able to restore a tree:

  1. There must be exactly one index r that pr = r. A vertex r is a root of the tree. 
  2. For all other n - 1 vertices i, there is an edge between vertex i and vertex pi. 



A sequence p1, p2, ..., pn is called valid if the described procedure generates some (any) rooted tree. For example, for n = 3 sequences (1,2,2), (2,3,1) and (2,1,3) are not valid.

You are given a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, not necessarily valid. Your task is to change the minimum number of elements, in order to get a valid sequence. Print the minimum number of changes and an example of a valid sequence after that number of changes. If there are many valid sequences achievable in the minimum number of changes, print any of them.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of vertices in the tree.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ n).

Output

In the first line print the minimum number of elements to change, in order to get a valid sequence.

In the second line, print any valid sequence possible to get from (a1, a2, ..., an) in the minimum number of changes. If there are many such sequences, any of them will be accepted.

Examples

Input

4
2 3 3 4


Output

1
2 3 4 4 


Input

5
3 2 2 5 3


Output

0
3 2 2 5 3 


Input

8
2 3 5 4 1 6 6 7


Output

2
2 3 7 8 1 6 6 7

Note

In the first sample, it's enough to change one element. In the provided output, a sequence represents a tree rooted in a vertex 4 (because p4 = 4), which you can see on the left drawing below. One of other correct solutions would be a sequence 2 3 3 2, representing a tree rooted in vertex 3 (right drawing below). On both drawings, roots are painted red.

In the second sample, the given sequence is already valid.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import itertools
import sys

class Solution(object):

    def find(self, ident, fa):
        if fa[ident] != ident:
            fa[ident] = self.find(fa[ident], fa)
        return fa[ident]

    def merge(self, ident_child, ident_father, fa):
        fa_child = fa[ident_child]
        fa_father = fa[ident_father]
        fa[fa_child] = fa_father

    def solve(self):
        n = self.n
        p = self.p
        issues = []
        roots = []
        fa = [i for i in xrange(n)]
        for current in xrange(n):
            parent = p[current]
            if parent == current:
                roots.append(current)
                continue
            parent_set_id = self.find(parent, fa)
            if parent_set_id == current:
                issues.append(current)
                continue
            self.merge(current, parent, fa)
        root = None
        changes = 0
        if len(roots) > 0:
            root = roots[0]
            changes = len(roots) + len(issues) - 1
        elif len(roots) == 0:
            root = roots[0] if len(roots) > 0 else issues[0]
            changes = len(roots) + len(issues)
        for ident in itertools.chain(roots, issues):
            p[ident] = root
        return (changes, p)

    def read_data(self):
        self.n = func_1()[0]
        self.p = func_1(delta=-1)

    def print_result(self, result):
        (changes, p) = result
        print(changes)
        for (idx, parent) in enumerate(p):
            sys.stdout.write(str(parent))
            if idx != len(p) - 1:
                sys.stdout.write(' ')
        sys.stdout.write('\n')

    def run(self):
        self.read_data()
        result = self.solve()
        self.print_result(result)
if len(sys.argv) > 1:
    sys.stdin = open(sys.argv[1], 'r')
    print('Redirect stdin to {0}'.format(sys.argv[1]))
Solution().run()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: delta is a list of integers with length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) where each element ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n.
def func_1(delta):
    return [(int(i) + delta) for i in raw_input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is the sum of an input integer and the corresponding element in list `delta`. The input integers are provided by the user.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
