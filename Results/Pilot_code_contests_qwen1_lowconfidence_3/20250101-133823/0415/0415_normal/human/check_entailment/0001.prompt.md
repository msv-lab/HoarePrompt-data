You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A tree is an undirected connected graph without cycles.

Let's consider a rooted undirected tree with n vertices, numbered 1 through n. There are many ways to represent such a tree. One way is to create an array with n integers p1, p2, ..., pn, where pi denotes a parent of vertex i (here, for convenience a root is considered its own parent).

<image> For this rooted tree the array p is [2, 3, 3, 2].

Given a sequence p1, p2, ..., pn, one is able to restore a tree:

  1. There must be exactly one index r that pr = r. A vertex r is a root of the tree. 
  2. For all other n - 1 vertices i, there is an edge between vertex i and vertex pi. 



A sequence p1, p2, ..., pn is called valid if the described procedure generates some (any) rooted tree. For example, for n = 3 sequences (1,2,2), (2,3,1) and (2,1,3) are not valid.

You are given a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, not necessarily valid. Your task is to change the minimum number of elements, in order to get a valid sequence. Print the minimum number of changes and an example of a valid sequence after that number of changes. If there are many valid sequences achievable in the minimum number of changes, print any of them.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of vertices in the tree.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ n).

Output

In the first line print the minimum number of elements to change, in order to get a valid sequence.

In the second line, print any valid sequence possible to get from (a1, a2, ..., an) in the minimum number of changes. If there are many such sequences, any of them will be accepted.

Examples

Input

4
2 3 3 4


Output

1
2 3 4 4 


Input

5
3 2 2 5 3


Output

0
3 2 2 5 3 


Input

8
2 3 5 4 1 6 6 7


Output

2
2 3 7 8 1 6 6 7

Note

In the first sample, it's enough to change one element. In the provided output, a sequence represents a tree rooted in a vertex 4 (because p4 = 4), which you can see on the left drawing below. One of other correct solutions would be a sequence 2 3 3 2, representing a tree rooted in vertex 3 (right drawing below). On both drawings, roots are painted red.

<image>

In the second sample, the given sequence is already valid.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
