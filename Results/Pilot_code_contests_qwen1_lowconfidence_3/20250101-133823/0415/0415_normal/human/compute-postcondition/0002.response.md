Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `delta` and expects user input in the form of a space-separated string of integers. It then processes this input by splitting the string into individual integers, converting them to integers, and adding each integer to the corresponding element in `delta`. The function returns a new list of integers, where each integer is the sum of an input integer and the corresponding element in `delta`. Potential edge cases include handling empty input strings or ensuring that the input string contains the correct number of integers to match the length of `delta`. If the input string does not contain enough integers, the function will use the remaining elements of `delta` with a value of 0 for the missing integers.**
