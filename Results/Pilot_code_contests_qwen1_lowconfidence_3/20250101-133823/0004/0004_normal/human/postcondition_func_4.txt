The function `func_5` reads a single line of input from `stdin` expecting it to contain the size of a permutation `n` followed by `n` space-separated integers representing `s_1, s_2, ..., s_n`. It then converts these integers into a map object where each element in the list is an integer. This means the function effectively transforms the input string into a map of integers. Potential edge cases include when the input does not follow the expected format (e.g., incorrect number of integers, non-integer values), in which case the function would still attempt to convert the elements but might raise a `ValueError`. However, the code does not handle such exceptions, so it is important to note that the function may fail silently in these cases.
