Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to restore the permutation based on the given `s` values. Specifically, the functions `func_2`, `func_7`, and `func_8` do not seem to handle the problem as described in the problem statement.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` returns a list of integers from the input, but the problem description specifies that the input for `s_i` values is expected to be read directly into a list of integers, not processed as a map. The function `func_2` returns a map object, which is not necessary and might lead to confusion or errors in subsequent operations.

2. **Function `func_7`:**
   - The function `func_7` is responsible for updating the Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) with the value `v` at index `i`. However, the logic for updating the BIT seems correct. The issue lies elsewhere in the overall logic of restoring the permutation.

3. **Function `func_8`:**
   - The function `func_8` is intended to find the largest index `j` such that the sum of elements in the BIT up to `j` is less than or equal to `x`. The logic here seems to be correct and aligns with the problem description.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic in the program appears to be flawed. The variable `l` is initialized with the result of `func_2`, but it should directly represent the `s` values as a list of integers. The subsequent operations, particularly the use of `func_7` and `func_8`, do not seem to correctly restore the permutation based on the `s` values.

### Example Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
3
0 1 2
```

Expected output:
```
3 2 1
```

However, the provided code does not produce the correct output. The main issue lies in the way the permutation is being restored. The functions `func_7` and `func_8` are not correctly used to update and query the BIT to restore the permutation.

To correctly solve the problem, the following steps are needed:
1. Read the `s` values correctly.
2. Use a BIT to keep track of the cumulative sums.
3. Restore the permutation using the correct logic for finding the appropriate elements.

Since the provided code does not implement the correct logic to restore the permutation, the program is incorrect.
