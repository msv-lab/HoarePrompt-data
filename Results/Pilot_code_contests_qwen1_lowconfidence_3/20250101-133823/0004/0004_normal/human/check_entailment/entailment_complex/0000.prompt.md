You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An array of integers p_{1},p_{2}, …,p_{n} is called a permutation if it contains each number from 1 to n exactly once. For example, the following arrays are permutations: [3,1,2], [1], [1,2,3,4,5] and [4,3,1,2]. The following arrays are not permutations: [2], [1,1], [2,3,4].

There is a hidden permutation of length n.

For each index i, you are given s_{i}, which equals to the sum of all p_{j} such that j < i and p_{j} < p_{i}. In other words, s_i is the sum of elements before the i-th element that are smaller than the i-th element.

Your task is to restore the permutation.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the size of the permutation.

The second line contains n integers s_{1}, s_{2}, …, s_{n} (0 ≤ s_{i} ≤ (n(n-1))/(2)).

It is guaranteed that the array s corresponds to a valid permutation of length n.

Output

Print n integers p_{1}, p_{2}, …, p_{n} — the elements of the restored permutation. We can show that the answer is always unique.

Examples

Input


3
0 0 0


Output


3 2 1


Input


2
0 1


Output


1 2


Input


5
0 1 1 1 10


Output


1 4 3 2 5

Note

In the first example for each i there is no index j satisfying both conditions, hence s_i are always 0.

In the second example for i = 2 it happens that j = 1 satisfies the conditions, so s_2 = p_1.

In the third example for i = 2, 3, 4 only j = 1 satisfies the conditions, so s_2 = s_3 = s_4 = 1. For i = 5 all j = 1, 2, 3, 4 are possible, so s_5 = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 = 10.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are provided, and the function reads input from stdin using `raw_input()`. The input consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n` representing the size of the permutation, and the second line contains `n` integers `s_1, s_2, ..., s_n` representing the sums described in the problem statement.
def func_1():
    return int(raw_input())
    #The program reads an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers from stdin, and then returns the first integer read from stdin
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` from standard input followed by a list of `n` integers, and then returns the first integer read from stdin. There are no parameters passed to the function, and the function relies solely on user input via `raw_input()`. The function does not perform any operations on the list of integers beyond returning the first integer read. No edge cases are handled within the function, and it assumes valid input will always be provided.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are provided. However, the function is expected to read input from stdin. It should read a single line containing an integer n followed by another line containing n space-separated integers representing the array s.
def func_2():
    return map(int, raw_input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers converted from n space-separated integers read from stdin
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a single line containing an integer `n` followed by another line containing `n` space-separated integers representing the array `s`. It then converts these integers into a map object and returns this object. Potential edge cases include when `n` is less than 1 or when the input does not match the expected format (e.g., non-integer values or missing lines). The function does not handle these edge cases; thus, the behavior in such scenarios is undefined.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}.
def func_3(n):
    stdout.write(str(n) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts an integer `n` within the specified range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5. It checks if `n` is within the valid range. If `n` is within the range, it prints `n` followed by a newline character. If `n` is outside the range, it does not perform any action (since no error handling is implemented in the provided code) and the function simply ends without returning anything. Therefore, the function either prints the integer `n` or does nothing if `n` is out of the specified range.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n integers representing the values of s_1, s_2, ..., s_n, where 0 ≤ s_i ≤ (n(n-1))/2 and it corresponds to a valid permutation of length n.
def func_4(arr):
    pr(' '.join(map(str, arr)) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a list `arr` of `n` integers and returns `True` if the list satisfies the condition that each element `s_i` in `arr` is within the range `0 ≤ s_i ≤ \frac{n(n-1)}{2}` and corresponds to a valid permutation of length `n`. The function does not modify the input list. If the list does not meet these conditions, the function returns `False`.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no parameter passed to the function `func_5`. The function reads input from `stdin`, which is expected to be a single line containing `n` (the size of the permutation) followed by `n` space-separated integers representing `s_1, s_2, ..., s_n`.
def func_5():
    return map(int, stdin.read().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts each element in the list of space-separated integers read from stdin to an integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reads a single line of input from `stdin` expecting it to contain the size of a permutation `n` followed by `n` space-separated integers representing `s_1, s_2, ..., s_n`. It then converts these integers into a map object where each element in the list is an integer. This means the function effectively transforms the input string into a map of integers. Potential edge cases include when the input does not follow the expected format (e.g., incorrect number of integers, non-integer values), in which case the function would still attempt to convert the elements but might raise a `ValueError`. However, the code does not handle such exceptions, so it is important to note that the function may fail silently in these cases.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 1 <= i <= n, and BITTree is a Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) that has been previously constructed and updated according to the rules of the permutation restoration problem.
def func_6(i):
    s = 0
    i = i + 1
    while i > 0:
        s += BITTree[i]
        
        i -= i & -i
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'i' is 0, 's' is the sum of all values in the BITTree from index 1 to the highest index where 'i' was originally set to 1.
    return s
    #The program returns 0, since 'i' is originally set to 0 and there is no index where 'i' was set to 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts an integer `i` within the range [1, n] and returns the sum of all values in the Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) from index 1 up to the highest index where `i` was originally set to 1. The function iterates through the BITTree, updating `i` in each iteration until `i` becomes 0. If `i` is never set to 1 during the iteration, the function returns 0.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 0 <= i <= n, and v is an integer representing the value to be added to the Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) at index i.
def func_7(i, v):
    i += 1
    while i <= n:
        BITTree[i] += v
        
        i += i & -i
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is the smallest power of 2 greater than `n`, `v` is the integer representing the value to be added to the BITTree at the final index, `n` remains unchanged, and `BITTree[j]` is updated for all indices `j` such that `1 <= j <= n` and `j` is affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` updates a Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) by incrementing the value at a specific index `i` by `v`. The function starts by incrementing `i` by 1. Then, it enters a loop where it updates the BITTree by adding `v` to the element at the current index `i` and then moves to the next relevant index using `i += i & -i`. This process continues until `i` exceeds `n`. After the loop, `i` will be the smallest power of 2 greater than `n`, `v` will be the value that was added during the last update, `n` remains unchanged, and the BITTree will have been updated for all indices `j` such that `1 <= j <= n` and `j` is affected by the loop. If `i` is already greater than `n` initially, the BITTree will only be updated once at index `i-1`. If `i` is equal to `n` initially, the BITTree will be updated for all indices up to `n`.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 0 <= x <= (n*(n-1))//2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 21, and BITTree is a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) of size at least n + 1 initialized with zeros.
def func_8(x):
    ret = 0
    sm = 0
    for i in range(21, -1, -1):
        pw = 1 << i
        
        if ret + pw <= n and sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x:
            ret += pw
            sm += BITTree[ret]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ret` is the largest integer `j` such that `sm + BITTree[j] <= x` and `j \leq n`, `sm` is the sum of `BITTree` values up to `ret`, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros, and `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
    return ret
    #The program returns ret, which is the largest integer j such that sm + BITTree[j] <= x and j <= n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts an integer `x` such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n \cdot (n-1)}{2}\), where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21, and `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros. The function iterates over the bits of `n` in reverse order, starting from \(2^{20}\) down to \(2^0\). For each bit position, it checks if adding the corresponding power of two to `ret` and updating `sm` with the value from `BITTree` keeps `sm + BITTree[ret]` less than or equal to `x`. If so, it updates `ret` and `sm`. After the loop, the function returns `ret`, which is the largest integer `j` such that `sm + BITTree[j] <= x` and `j <= n`.

The function handles the following edge cases:
1. If `x` is 0, the function will set `ret` to 0 and `sm` to 0, and then return 0.
2. If `BITTree` does not contain any values that satisfy the condition `sm + BITTree[j] <= x`, `ret` will remain 0 after the loop, and the function will return 0.

There are no missing functionalities mentioned in the provided code or annotations. The function correctly implements the described behavior and handles the specified constraints and conditions.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
