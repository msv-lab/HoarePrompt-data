Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not implement the logic to restore the permutation based on the given `s` values. The code includes several placeholder functions (`func_1` to `func_8`) that do not contribute to solving the problem. The problem requires a specific algorithm to restore the permutation, and none of the provided functions contain this logic. The output hints describe the behavior of one of the placeholder functions (`func_8`), but they do not relate to the actual problem-solving logic needed to restore the permutation. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and cannot be considered correct.
