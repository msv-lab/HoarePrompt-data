You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An array of integers p_{1},p_{2}, …,p_{n} is called a permutation if it contains each number from 1 to n exactly once. For example, the following arrays are permutations: [3,1,2], [1], [1,2,3,4,5] and [4,3,1,2]. The following arrays are not permutations: [2], [1,1], [2,3,4].

There is a hidden permutation of length n.

For each index i, you are given s_{i}, which equals to the sum of all p_{j} such that j < i and p_{j} < p_{i}. In other words, s_i is the sum of elements before the i-th element that are smaller than the i-th element.

Your task is to restore the permutation.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the size of the permutation.

The second line contains n integers s_{1}, s_{2}, …, s_{n} (0 ≤ s_{i} ≤ (n(n-1))/(2)).

It is guaranteed that the array s corresponds to a valid permutation of length n.

Output

Print n integers p_{1}, p_{2}, …, p_{n} — the elements of the restored permutation. We can show that the answer is always unique.

Examples

Input


3
0 0 0


Output


3 2 1


Input


2
0 1


Output


1 2


Input


5
0 1 1 1 10


Output


1 4 3 2 5

Note

In the first example for each i there is no index j satisfying both conditions, hence s_i are always 0.

In the second example for i = 2 it happens that j = 1 satisfies the conditions, so s_2 = p_1.

In the third example for i = 2, 3, 4 only j = 1 satisfies the conditions, so s_2 = s_3 = s_4 = 1. For i = 5 all j = 1, 2, 3, 4 are possible, so s_5 = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 = 10.

    ret = 0
    sm = 0
    for i in range(21, -1, -1):
        pw = 1 << i
        if ret + pw <= n and sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x:
            ret += pw
            sm += BITTree[ret]
    return ret

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the logic to restore the permutation based on the given `s` values. Instead, it contains several placeholder functions that do not contribute to solving the problem. Specifically, the code includes functions like `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`, and `func_8`, but none of these functions contain the necessary logic to solve the problem as described.

To correctly solve this problem, the code should involve identifying the smallest number that can fit at each position in the permutation based on the `s` values. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def restore_permutation(n, s):
    permutation = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        count = 0
        for j in range(1, i + 1):
            if s[i] >= s[j - 1]:
                count += 1
            else:
                break
        permutation[i] = count + 1
        s[i] -= count
    return permutation

# Reading input
n = int(input())
s = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Restoring the permutation
permutation = restore_permutation(n, s)

# Printing the result
print(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
```

This corrected code implements the logic to restore the permutation correctly based on the `s` values. It iterates through each position and finds the smallest number that fits the condition, updating the `s` values accordingly. This ensures that the permutation is restored correctly for any valid input.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 8 : The function `func_8` accepts an integer `x` such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n \cdot (n-1)}{2}\), where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21, and `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros. The function iterates over the bits of `n` in reverse order, starting from \(2^{20}\) down to \(2^0\). For each bit position, it checks if adding the corresponding power of two to `ret` and updating `sm` with the value from `BITTree` keeps `sm + BITTree[ret]` less than or equal to `x`. If so, it updates `ret` and `sm`. After the loop, the function returns `ret`, which is the largest integer `j` such that `sm + BITTree[j] <= x` and `j <= n`.

The function handles the following edge cases:
1. If `x` is 0, the function will set `ret` to 0 and `sm` to 0, and then return 0.
2. If `BITTree` does not contain any values that satisfy the condition `sm + BITTree[j] <= x`, `ret` will remain 0 after the loop, and the function will return 0.

There are no missing functionalities mentioned in the provided code or annotations. The function correctly implements the described behavior and handles the specified constraints and conditions.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
