You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An array of integers p_{1},p_{2}, …,p_{n} is called a permutation if it contains each number from 1 to n exactly once. For example, the following arrays are permutations: [3,1,2], [1], [1,2,3,4,5] and [4,3,1,2]. The following arrays are not permutations: [2], [1,1], [2,3,4].

There is a hidden permutation of length n.

For each index i, you are given s_{i}, which equals to the sum of all p_{j} such that j < i and p_{j} < p_{i}. In other words, s_i is the sum of elements before the i-th element that are smaller than the i-th element.

Your task is to restore the permutation.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the size of the permutation.

The second line contains n integers s_{1}, s_{2}, …, s_{n} (0 ≤ s_{i} ≤ (n(n-1))/(2)).

It is guaranteed that the array s corresponds to a valid permutation of length n.

Output

Print n integers p_{1}, p_{2}, …, p_{n} — the elements of the restored permutation. We can show that the answer is always unique.

Examples

Input


3
0 0 0


Output


3 2 1


Input


2
0 1


Output


1 2


Input


5
0 1 1 1 10


Output


1 4 3 2 5

Note

In the first example for each i there is no index j satisfying both conditions, hence s_i are always 0.

In the second example for i = 2 it happens that j = 1 satisfies the conditions, so s_2 = p_1.

In the third example for i = 2, 3, 4 only j = 1 satisfies the conditions, so s_2 = s_3 = s_4 = 1. For i = 5 all j = 1, 2, 3, 4 are possible, so s_5 = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 = 10.
Functions with output description for each function:
from sys import stdin, stdout
from collections import Counter, defaultdict
from itertools import permutations, combinations

raw_input = stdin.readline
pr = stdout.write
mod = 10 ** 9 + 7
range = xrange
n = func_1()
BITTree = [0] * (n + 1)
l = func_2()
for i in range(n):
    func_7(i, i)
ans = [0] * n
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    ans[i] = func_8(l[i])
    func_7(ans[i], -ans[i])
func_4(ans)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(raw_input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function reads an integer `n` from standard input followed by a list of `n` integers, and then returns the first integer read from stdin. There are no parameters passed to the function, and the function relies solely on user input via `raw_input()`. The function does not perform any operations on the list of integers beyond returning the first integer read. No edge cases are handled within the function, and it assumes valid input will always be provided.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, raw_input().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function reads a single line containing an integer `n` followed by another line containing `n` space-separated integers representing the array `s`. It then converts these integers into a map object and returns this object. Potential edge cases include when `n` is less than 1 or when the input does not match the expected format (e.g., non-integer values or missing lines). The function does not handle these edge cases; thus, the behavior in such scenarios is undefined.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(n):
    stdout.write(str(n) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts an integer `n` within the specified range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5. It checks if `n` is within the valid range. If `n` is within the range, it prints `n` followed by a newline character. If `n` is outside the range, it does not perform any action (since no error handling is implemented in the provided code) and the function simply ends without returning anything. Therefore, the function either prints the integer `n` or does nothing if `n` is out of the specified range.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(arr):
    pr(' '.join(map(str, arr)) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a list `arr` of `n` integers and returns `True` if the list satisfies the condition that each element `s_i` in `arr` is within the range `0 ≤ s_i ≤ \frac{n(n-1)}{2}` and corresponds to a valid permutation of length `n`. The function does not modify the input list. If the list does not meet these conditions, the function returns `False`.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return map(int, stdin.read().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` reads a single line of input from `stdin` expecting it to contain the size of a permutation `n` followed by `n` space-separated integers representing `s_1, s_2, ..., s_n`. It then converts these integers into a map object where each element in the list is an integer. This means the function effectively transforms the input string into a map of integers. Potential edge cases include when the input does not follow the expected format (e.g., incorrect number of integers, non-integer values), in which case the function would still attempt to convert the elements but might raise a `ValueError`. However, the code does not handle such exceptions, so it is important to note that the function may fail silently in these cases.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(i):
    s = 0
    i = i + 1
    while i > 0:
        s += BITTree[i]
        i -= i & -i
    return s
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts an integer `i` within the range [1, n] and returns the sum of all values in the Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) from index 1 up to the highest index where `i` was originally set to 1. The function iterates through the BITTree, updating `i` in each iteration until `i` becomes 0. If `i` is never set to 1 during the iteration, the function returns 0.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(i, v):
    i += 1
    while i <= n:
        BITTree[i] += v
        i += i & -i
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` updates a Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) by incrementing the value at a specific index `i` by `v`. The function starts by incrementing `i` by 1. Then, it enters a loop where it updates the BITTree by adding `v` to the element at the current index `i` and then moves to the next relevant index using `i += i & -i`. This process continues until `i` exceeds `n`. After the loop, `i` will be the smallest power of 2 greater than `n`, `v` will be the value that was added during the last update, `n` remains unchanged, and the BITTree will have been updated for all indices `j` such that `1 <= j <= n` and `j` is affected by the loop. If `i` is already greater than `n` initially, the BITTree will only be updated once at index `i-1`. If `i` is equal to `n` initially, the BITTree will be updated for all indices up to `n`.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(x):
    ret = 0
    sm = 0
    for i in range(21, -1, -1):
        pw = 1 << i
        if ret + pw <= n and sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x:
            ret += pw
            sm += BITTree[ret]
    return ret
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts an integer `x` such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n \cdot (n-1)}{2}\), where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21, and `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros. The function iterates over the bits of `n` in reverse order, starting from \(2^{20}\) down to \(2^0\). For each bit position, it checks if adding the corresponding power of two to `ret` and updating `sm` with the value from `BITTree` keeps `sm + BITTree[ret]` less than or equal to `x`. If so, it updates `ret` and `sm`. After the loop, the function returns `ret`, which is the largest integer `j` such that `sm + BITTree[j] <= x` and `j <= n`.

The function handles the following edge cases:
1. If `x` is 0, the function will set `ret` to 0 and `sm` to 0, and then return 0.
2. If `BITTree` does not contain any values that satisfy the condition `sm + BITTree[j] <= x`, `ret` will remain 0 after the loop, and the function will return 0.

There are no missing functionalities mentioned in the provided code or annotations. The function correctly implements the described behavior and handles the specified constraints and conditions.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
