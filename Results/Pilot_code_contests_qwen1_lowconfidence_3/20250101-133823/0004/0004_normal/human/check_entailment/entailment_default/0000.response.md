Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to restore the permutation based on the given `s` values. Specifically, the functions `func_7` and `func_8` are used to manipulate and query a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), but the main logic to restore the permutation is missing. 

The code reads the input and initializes the BIT, but it does not construct the permutation according to the problem description. The function `func_8` is designed to find the appropriate index for each element of the permutation, but it does not properly integrate this into the restoration process. 

Given the problem description and the hints provided, the code does not handle the construction of the permutation correctly. It lacks the necessary steps to iterate over the `s` values and place each element in the correct position to ensure the permutation property is maintained. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence is considered incorrect.
