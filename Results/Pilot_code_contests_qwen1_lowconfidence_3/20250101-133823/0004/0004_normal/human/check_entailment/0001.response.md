Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the logic to restore the permutation based on the given `s` values. The functions defined do not contribute to solving the problem as described. Specifically, the problem requires constructing a permutation `p` such that for each index `i`, `s_i` is the sum of all `p_j` where `j < i` and `p_j < p_i`. However, the code snippet provided does not contain any function that addresses this requirement. 

For instance, consider the following input:

```
3
0 0 0
```

The expected output is `[3, 2, 1]`, but the provided code does not have any functionality to generate this permutation based on the `s` values. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
