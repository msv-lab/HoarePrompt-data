You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: An array of integers p_{1},p_{2}, …,p_{n} is called a permutation if it contains each number from 1 to n exactly once. For example, the following arrays are permutations: [3,1,2], [1], [1,2,3,4,5] and [4,3,1,2]. The following arrays are not permutations: [2], [1,1], [2,3,4].

There is a hidden permutation of length n.

For each index i, you are given s_{i}, which equals to the sum of all p_{j} such that j < i and p_{j} < p_{i}. In other words, s_i is the sum of elements before the i-th element that are smaller than the i-th element.

Your task is to restore the permutation.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the size of the permutation.

The second line contains n integers s_{1}, s_{2}, …, s_{n} (0 ≤ s_{i} ≤ (n(n-1))/(2)).

It is guaranteed that the array s corresponds to a valid permutation of length n.

Output

Print n integers p_{1}, p_{2}, …, p_{n} — the elements of the restored permutation. We can show that the answer is always unique.

Examples

Input


3
0 0 0


Output


3 2 1


Input


2
0 1


Output


1 2


Input


5
0 1 1 1 10


Output


1 4 3 2 5

Note

In the first example for each i there is no index j satisfying both conditions, hence s_i are always 0.

In the second example for i = 2 it happens that j = 1 satisfies the conditions, so s_2 = p_1.

In the third example for i = 2, 3, 4 only j = 1 satisfies the conditions, so s_2 = s_3 = s_4 = 1. For i = 5 all j = 1, 2, 3, 4 are possible, so s_5 = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 = 10.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout
from collections import Counter, defaultdict
from itertools import permutations, combinations

raw_input = stdin.readline
pr = stdout.write
mod = 10 ** 9 + 7
range = xrange
n = func_1()
BITTree = [0] * (n + 1)
l = func_2()
for i in range(n):
    func_7(i, i)
ans = [0] * n
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    ans[i] = func_8(l[i])
    func_7(ans[i], -ans[i])
func_4(ans)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are provided, and the function reads input from stdin using `raw_input()`. The input consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n` representing the size of the permutation, and the second line contains `n` integers `s_1, s_2, ..., s_n` representing the sums described in the problem statement.
def func_1():
    return int(raw_input())
    #The program reads an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers from stdin, and then returns the first integer read from stdin

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are provided. However, the function is expected to read input from stdin. It should read a single line containing an integer n followed by another line containing n space-separated integers representing the array s.
def func_2():
    return map(int, raw_input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers converted from n space-separated integers read from stdin

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}.
def func_3(n):
    stdout.write(str(n) + '\n')

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n integers representing the values of s_1, s_2, ..., s_n, where 0 ≤ s_i ≤ (n(n-1))/2 and it corresponds to a valid permutation of length n.
def func_4(arr):
    pr(' '.join(map(str, arr)) + '\n')

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no parameter passed to the function `func_5`. The function reads input from `stdin`, which is expected to be a single line containing `n` (the size of the permutation) followed by `n` space-separated integers representing `s_1, s_2, ..., s_n`.
def func_5():
    return map(int, stdin.read().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts each element in the list of space-separated integers read from stdin to an integer

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 1 <= i <= n, and BITTree is a Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) that has been previously constructed and updated according to the rules of the permutation restoration problem.
def func_6(i):
    s = 0
    i = i + 1
    while i > 0:
        s += BITTree[i]
        
        i -= i & -i
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'i' is 0, 's' is the sum of all values in the BITTree from index 1 to the highest index where 'i' was originally set to 1.
    return s
    #The program returns 0, since 'i' is originally set to 0 and there is no index where 'i' was set to 1

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 0 <= i <= n, and v is an integer representing the value to be added to the Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) at index i.
def func_7(i, v):
    i += 1
    while i <= n:
        BITTree[i] += v
        
        i += i & -i
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is the smallest power of 2 greater than `n`, `v` is the integer representing the value to be added to the BITTree at the final index, `n` remains unchanged, and `BITTree[j]` is updated for all indices `j` such that `1 <= j <= n` and `j` is affected by the loop.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 0 <= x <= (n*(n-1))//2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 21, and BITTree is a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) of size at least n + 1 initialized with zeros.
def func_8(x):
    ret = 0
    sm = 0
    for i in range(21, -1, -1):
        pw = 1 << i
        
        if ret + pw <= n and sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x:
            ret += pw
            sm += BITTree[ret]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ret` is the largest integer `j` such that `sm + BITTree[j] <= x` and `j \leq n`, `sm` is the sum of `BITTree` values up to `ret`, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros, and `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
    return ret
    #The program returns ret, which is the largest integer j such that sm + BITTree[j] <= x and j <= n


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
