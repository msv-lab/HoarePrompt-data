The function `func_8` accepts an integer `x` such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n \cdot (n-1)}{2}\), where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21, and `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros. The function iterates over the bits of `n` in reverse order, starting from \(2^{20}\) down to \(2^0\). For each bit position, it checks if adding the corresponding power of two to `ret` and updating `sm` with the value from `BITTree` keeps `sm + BITTree[ret]` less than or equal to `x`. If so, it updates `ret` and `sm`. After the loop, the function returns `ret`, which is the largest integer `j` such that `sm + BITTree[j] <= x` and `j <= n`.

The function handles the following edge cases:
1. If `x` is 0, the function will set `ret` to 0 and `sm` to 0, and then return 0.
2. If `BITTree` does not contain any values that satisfy the condition `sm + BITTree[j] <= x`, `ret` will remain 0 after the loop, and the function will return 0.

There are no missing functionalities mentioned in the provided code or annotations. The function correctly implements the described behavior and handles the specified constraints and conditions.
