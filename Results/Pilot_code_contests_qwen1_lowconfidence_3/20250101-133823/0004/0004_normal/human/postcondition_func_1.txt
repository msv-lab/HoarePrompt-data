The function reads a single line containing an integer `n` followed by another line containing `n` space-separated integers representing the array `s`. It then converts these integers into a map object and returns this object. Potential edge cases include when `n` is less than 1 or when the input does not match the expected format (e.g., non-integer values or missing lines). The function does not handle these edge cases; thus, the behavior in such scenarios is undefined.
