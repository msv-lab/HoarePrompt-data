Postcondition: ***`i` is 21, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `ret` is 0, `sm` is 0, `pw` is 2^21. The current value of `ret + pw` is less than or equal to `n`, and the current value of `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]` is less than or equal to `x`***
