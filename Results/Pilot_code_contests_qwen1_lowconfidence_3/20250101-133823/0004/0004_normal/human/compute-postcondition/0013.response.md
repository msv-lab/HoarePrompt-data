Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 20
   - `pw` is 1048576
   - `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21
   - `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros
   - `ret` is either `ret + 1048576` or the same as before
   - `sm` is the previous value of `sm` plus `BITTree[ret]` if `ret + pw <= n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x`, otherwise `ret` and `sm` remain unchanged

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 21 to -1 (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.

3. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 20.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1, making it 19.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `i` is now 19, no changes are needed for `i`.
   - `pw` remains the same (1048576).
   - `n` remains the same (an integer greater than or equal to 21).
   - `BITTree` remains the same (Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros).
   - `ret` and `sm` will depend on the condition inside the loop, but since we are only adjusting the state for the next iteration, we assume they remain as they were before unless explicitly modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 19, `pw` is 1048576, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `ret` is either `ret + 1048576` or the same as before, `sm` is the previous value of `sm` plus `BITTree[ret]` if `ret + pw <= n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x`, otherwise `ret` and `sm` remain unchanged.**
