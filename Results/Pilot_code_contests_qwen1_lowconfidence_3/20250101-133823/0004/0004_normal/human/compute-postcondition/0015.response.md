`ret` is incremented by `pw`. The previous value of `ret` is `n`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 21. After adding `pw` (which is 524288) to `ret`, the new value of `ret` becomes `n + 524288`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `pw`, `n`, `BITTree`, `ret`, and `sm`) are not directly affected in terms of their relationships or conditions, except for `ret` which now holds the updated value.

Output State: **`i` is 19; `pw` is 524288; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21; `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros; `ret` is `n + 524288`; `sm` is the previous value of `sm` plus `BITTree[ret]` if `ret + pw <= n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x`, otherwise `ret` and `sm` remain unchanged.**
