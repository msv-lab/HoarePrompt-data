The code initializes `sm` to 0, which does not affect the values of `x`, `n`, `BITTree`, or `ret`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros, and `ret` is 0; `sm` is 0.**
