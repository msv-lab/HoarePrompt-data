Postcondition: ***`i` is 19; `pw` is 524288; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21; `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros; if `ret + pw <= n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x`, then `ret` is updated to `n + 524288` and `sm` is updated to the previous value of `sm` plus `BITTree[n + 524288]`. Otherwise, `ret` and `sm` remain unchanged.***
