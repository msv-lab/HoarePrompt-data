Postcondition: ***`i` is 21, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `ret` is either `ret + 2^{21}` or the same as before, `sm` is the same as before, `pw` is \(2^{21}\), and `ret + pw` is less than or equal to `n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]` is less than or equal to `x` if the if condition is met, otherwise `ret` remains unchanged.***
