According to the code, the loop iterates from 21 down to 0. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are true:
- `i` is 21
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21
- `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros
- `ret` is either `ret + 2^21` or the same as before
- `sm` is the same as before
- `pw` is \(2^{21}\)
- `ret + pw` is less than or equal to `n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]` is less than or equal to `x` if the if condition is met, otherwise `ret` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 20. The other variables (`n`, `BITTree`, `ret`, `sm`, and `pw`) remain unchanged unless specified otherwise within the loop body, but based on the given information, they are not modified in the loop header or footer.

So, at the start of the next iteration, the following states need to be adjusted:

State: **`i` is 20, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `ret` is either `ret + 2^21` or the same as before, `sm` is the same as before, `pw` is \(2^{20}\), and `ret + pw` is less than or equal to `n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]` is less than or equal to `x` if the if condition is met, otherwise `ret` remains unchanged.**
