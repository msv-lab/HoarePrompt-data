The code snippet `pw = 1 << i` shifts the value of `1` left by `i` positions, which means `pw` is assigned the value \(2^i\). Given that `i` is 20, `pw` becomes \(2^{20}\).

Here's the breakdown:

- Initially, `i` is 20.
- The value of `pw` is updated to \(2^{20}\), which is 1048576.

All other variables (`n`, `BITTree`, `ret`, `sm`, and the condition involving `pw`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 20; `pw` is 1048576; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21; `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros; `ret` is either `ret + 2^21` or the same as before; `sm` is the same as before; `ret + pw` is less than or equal to `n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]` is less than or equal to `x` if the if condition is met, otherwise `ret` remains unchanged.**
