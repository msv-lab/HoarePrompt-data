The code `sm += BITTree[ret]` increments `sm` by the value of `BITTree[ret]`. Given the initial conditions:

- `ret + pw` is less than or equal to `n`
- `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]` is less than or equal to `x`

Since `pw` is \(2^{21}\) and `ret` is `ret + pw - pw`, the value of `BITTree[ret]` is the same as `BITTree[ret + pw - pw]`, which simplifies to `BITTree[ret + pw - pw]`.

Given that `BITTree` is initialized with zeros, `BITTree[ret]` will remain unchanged from its initial value (0) unless previously modified. However, since no modifications are mentioned before this line, we assume `BITTree[ret]` remains 0.

Therefore, the operation `sm += BITTree[ret]` translates to `sm += 0`, meaning `sm` does not change.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `BITTree`, `ret`, `sm`, `pw`) remain in their initial states as no other operations modify them.

Output State: **`i` is 21, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `ret` is `ret + 2^{21}`, `sm` is the same as before, `pw` is \(2^{21}\), the current value of `ret + pw` is less than or equal to `n`, and the current value of `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]` is less than or equal to `x`**.
