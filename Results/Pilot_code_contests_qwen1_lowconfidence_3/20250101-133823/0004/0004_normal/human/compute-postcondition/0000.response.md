The variable `ret` is assigned the value `0`. The initial values of `x` and `BITTree` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros, and `ret` is 0.
