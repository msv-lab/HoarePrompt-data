The code `pw = 1 << i` shifts the bit of `1` `i` positions to the left. Given that `i` is initially 21, shifting `1` 21 positions to the left results in `pw` being equal to `2^21`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is an integer greater than or equal to 21, `BITTree` remains a Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros, and `ret` and `sm` remain unchanged as they are both initialized to 0.

Output State: **`i` is 21, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `ret` is 0, `sm` is 0, `pw` is 2^21**
