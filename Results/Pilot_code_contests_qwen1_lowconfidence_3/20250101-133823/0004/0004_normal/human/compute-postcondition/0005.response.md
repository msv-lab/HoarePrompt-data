The code `ret += pw` increments the value of `ret` by `pw`. Given the initial state where `ret + pw` is less than or equal to `n`, and `pw` is equal to \(2^{21}\), after executing this line of code, `ret` will be updated to `ret + 2^{21}`.

Since the precondition states that `ret + pw` is less than or equal to `n`, and `pw` is \(2^{21}\), the new value of `ret` must also satisfy the condition that `ret + 2^{21}` is less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `i` is 21
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21
- `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros
- `ret` is updated to `ret + 2^{21}`
- `sm` is 0
- `pw` is \(2^{21}\)
- The current value of `ret + pw` is still less than or equal to `n`
- The current value of `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]` is still less than or equal to `x`

Output State: **`i` is 21, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `ret` is `ret + 2^{21}`, `sm` is 0, `pw` is \(2^{21}\), the current value of `ret + pw` is less than or equal to `n`, and the current value of `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]` is less than or equal to `x`**
