Postcondition: ***`i` is 20, `pw` is 1048576, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `ret` is either `ret + 1048576` or the same as before, `sm` is the previous value of `sm` plus `BITTree[ret]` if `ret + pw <= n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x`, otherwise `ret` and `sm` remain unchanged.***
