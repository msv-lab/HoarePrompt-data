The code `ret += pw` increments the value of `ret` by `pw`. Given the initial state, `pw` is 1048576, so `ret` is incremented by 1048576. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 20; `pw` is 1048576; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21; `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros; `ret` is `ret + 1048576`; `sm` is the same as before; `ret + pw` is less than or equal to `n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]` is less than or equal to `x` if the if condition is met, otherwise `ret` remains unchanged.**
