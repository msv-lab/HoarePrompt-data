The code `pw = 1 << i` shifts the value of `i` to the left by one bit, which effectively multiplies `i` by 2. Given that the initial state of `i` is 19, shifting it left by one bit results in `pw` being \(2^{19}\), which is 524288.

The other variables (`n`, `BITTree`, `ret`, and `sm`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 19; `pw` is 524288; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21; `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros; `ret` is either `ret + 1048576` or the same as before; `sm` is the previous value of `sm` plus `BITTree[ret]` if `ret + pw <= n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x`, otherwise `ret` and `sm` remain unchanged.**
