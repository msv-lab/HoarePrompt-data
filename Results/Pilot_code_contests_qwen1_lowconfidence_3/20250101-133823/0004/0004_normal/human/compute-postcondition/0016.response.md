`sm` is incremented by the value of `BITTree[ret]`. The value of `ret` is `n + 524288`, so the code updates `sm` by `BITTree[n + 524288]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 19; `pw` is 524288; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21; `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros; `ret` is `n + 524288`; `sm` is the previous value of `sm` plus `BITTree[n + 524288]`**
