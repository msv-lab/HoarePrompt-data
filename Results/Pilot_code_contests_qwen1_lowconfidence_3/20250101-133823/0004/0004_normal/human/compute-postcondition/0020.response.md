The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n \cdot (n-1)}{2}\), where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21, and `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros.

The function returns `ret`, which is the largest integer `j` such that `sm + BITTree[j] <= x` and `j <= n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_8` is to accept an integer `x` and return the largest integer `j` satisfying the given conditions.
