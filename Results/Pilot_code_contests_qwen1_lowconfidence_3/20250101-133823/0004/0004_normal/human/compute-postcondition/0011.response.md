`sm` is incremented by `BITTree[ret]`. The value of `ret` remains unchanged, and the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated value of `sm` is the previous value of `sm` plus the value of `BITTree[ret]`.

Output State: **`i` is 20, `pw` is 1048576, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `ret` is `ret + 1048576`, `sm` is the previous value of `sm` plus `BITTree[ret]`**
