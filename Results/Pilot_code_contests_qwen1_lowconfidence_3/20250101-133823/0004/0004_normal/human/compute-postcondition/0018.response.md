To determine the final state of the variables after the loop completes, let's analyze the loop code and the conditions under which the loop iterates. The loop runs in reverse order from 21 to 0, updating `ret` and `sm` based on the conditions inside the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21.
   - `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros.
   - `ret` is 0.
   - `sm` is 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration, the loop checks if adding the power of 2 (`pw`) to `ret` and the corresponding value in `BITTree` to `sm` keeps them within the constraints specified by `x` and `n`.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, `ret` is updated to `ret + pw`, and `sm` is updated to `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]`.

3. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop completes, `ret` will be the largest integer `j` such that `sm + BITTree[j] <= x` and `j \leq n`.
   - The value of `sm` will be the sum of `BITTree` values up to `ret`.

4. **Case when the Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If the loop does not execute at all (which happens if no bit positions satisfy the conditions), `ret` remains 0 and `sm` remains 0.

### Final Output State:

Given the analysis, we can conclude that after the loop finishes executing, `ret` and `sm` will be determined by the conditions checked within the loop. The value of `i` will be the last index of the loop, which will be 0 when the loop ends.

Output State: **`ret` is the largest integer `j` such that `sm + BITTree[j] <= x` and `j \leq n`, `sm` is the sum of `BITTree` values up to `ret`, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 21, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree of size at least `n + 1` initialized with zeros, and `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).**
