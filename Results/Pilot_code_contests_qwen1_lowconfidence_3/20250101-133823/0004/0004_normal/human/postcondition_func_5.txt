The function `func_6` accepts an integer `i` within the range [1, n] and returns the sum of all values in the Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) from index 1 up to the highest index where `i` was originally set to 1. The function iterates through the BITTree, updating `i` in each iteration until `i` becomes 0. If `i` is never set to 1 during the iteration, the function returns 0.
