The function reads an integer `n` from standard input followed by a list of `n` integers, and then returns the first integer read from stdin. There are no parameters passed to the function, and the function relies solely on user input via `raw_input()`. The function does not perform any operations on the list of integers beyond returning the first integer read. No edge cases are handled within the function, and it assumes valid input will always be provided.
