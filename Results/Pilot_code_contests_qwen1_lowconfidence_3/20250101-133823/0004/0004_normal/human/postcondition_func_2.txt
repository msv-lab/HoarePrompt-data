The function `func_3` accepts an integer `n` within the specified range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5. It checks if `n` is within the valid range. If `n` is within the range, it prints `n` followed by a newline character. If `n` is outside the range, it does not perform any action (since no error handling is implemented in the provided code) and the function simply ends without returning anything. Therefore, the function either prints the integer `n` or does nothing if `n` is out of the specified range.
