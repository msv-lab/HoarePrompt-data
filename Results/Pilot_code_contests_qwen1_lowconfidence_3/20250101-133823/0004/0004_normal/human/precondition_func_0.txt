None of the variables in the function signature are provided, and the function reads input from stdin using `raw_input()`. The input consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n` representing the size of the permutation, and the second line contains `n` integers `s_1, s_2, ..., s_n` representing the sums described in the problem statement.
