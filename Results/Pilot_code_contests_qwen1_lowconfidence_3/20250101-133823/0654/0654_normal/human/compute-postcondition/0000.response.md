The provided code snippet is a docstring for a function and does not actually perform any actions that would change the values of variables. It sets up a function with an argument `sync` which is expected to be a boolean value indicating whether the standard Python streams should be synchronized, but no such synchronization is performed here. Therefore, the value of `sync` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`sync` is a boolean value indicating whether to synchronize the standard Python streams.**
