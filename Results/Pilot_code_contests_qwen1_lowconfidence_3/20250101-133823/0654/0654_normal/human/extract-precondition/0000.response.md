Precondition: **sync is a boolean value indicating whether to synchronize the standard Python streams.** 

However, based on the problem description and the given function, it seems that `func_1` does not directly relate to the problem of counting the number of ways to paint the bricks. It appears to be a utility function for handling input/output buffering in Python. Therefore, the precondition described here is not relevant to the main problem and is more related to the internal workings of the provided code snippet.
