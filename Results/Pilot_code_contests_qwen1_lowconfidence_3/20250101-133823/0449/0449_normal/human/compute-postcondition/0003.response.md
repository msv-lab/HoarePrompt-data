The code `sys.exit()` will terminate the program immediately, without further execution of any subsequent statements. Given the initial state and the fact that `sys.stdout.write('0\n')` has already been executed, the only variables that were affected before the exit are `nCircles` and `ri`. However, since the program terminates, no new operations can alter these variables.

Output State: **`nCircles` is an integer between 1 and 100, `ri` is a list of `nCircles` unique integers between 1 and 1000, a value '0' has been written to stdout.**
