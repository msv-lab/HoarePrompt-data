Output State: **`nCircles` is an integer, `ri` is a list of `nCircles` unique integers, `areas` is a list containing the squares of all radii in `ri`, `input` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each radius provided in the input string.
- Each radius is converted to an integer, squared, and appended to the `areas` list.
- The loop will execute exactly `nCircles` times because there are `nCircles` unique radii in the list `ri`.
- After the loop completes, `areas` will contain the squares of all radii from `ri`.
- The `input` variable will eventually become an empty string once all radii have been processed and the input is no longer needed.

This output state covers all the necessary conditions and final values of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.
