The code initializes an empty list called `areas`. This does not change the value of `nCircles` or the contents of the `ri` list. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`nCircles` is an integer, and `ri` is a list of `nCircles` unique integers; `areas` is an empty list**
