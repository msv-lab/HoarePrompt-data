Postcondition: ***`nCircles` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `ri` is a list of `nCircles` unique integers, `areas` is a list containing the squares of all radii in `ri` sorted in ascending order and must have at least one element, `input` is an empty string, `totalArea` is the first element of `areas` if `index` is 0, otherwise `totalArea` is either `a3^2 - a2^2` if `index % 2 == 0`, `totalArea` remains unchanged if `index % 2 != 0`, `index` is 2 if `index % 2 == 0`, and `area` is the fourth element of `areas` if `index` is 2.***
