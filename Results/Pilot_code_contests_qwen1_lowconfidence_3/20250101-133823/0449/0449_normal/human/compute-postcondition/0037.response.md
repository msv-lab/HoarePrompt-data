The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user, which consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of concentric circles. The second line contains `n` space-separated integers `ri` (1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000), representing the radii of the circles, where each `ri` is unique. Based on the input, the function does not return any value but processes the data. However, since the question asks for the parameters and return value, we can describe the expected input format and the absence of a return value.
