Postcondition: ***The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer `nCircles` (1 ≤ nCircles ≤ 100), representing the number of concentric circles. The second line contains `nCircles` space-separated integers `ri` (1 ≤ `ri` ≤ 1000), representing the radii of the circles, where each `ri` is unique. The condition `nCircles < 1` is true.***
