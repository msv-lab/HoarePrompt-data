Functionality: **The function reads two lines of input from stdin. The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of concentric circles. The second line contains `n` space-separated integers `ri` (1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000), representing the radii of the circles, where each `ri` is unique. It then calculates the sum of the areas of these concentric circles, considering only the difference between consecutive radii squared multiplied by π. If `n` is less than 1, it outputs 0. The function writes the final calculated area to stdout.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is less than 1, the function correctly outputs 0 and exits.
- If `n` is 1, the function calculates the area using the given radius and multiplies it by π.
- If the radii are not provided in ascending order, the function still sorts them before calculating the differences.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code assumes that the input radii are unique, which is not explicitly checked. While the code sorts the radii, it does not handle duplicate radii as part of the problem statement. However, since the problem statement mentions that each `ri` is unique, this check might be implicit.
- There is no handling for invalid input formats, such as non-integer values or non-space-separated values in the second line of input.
