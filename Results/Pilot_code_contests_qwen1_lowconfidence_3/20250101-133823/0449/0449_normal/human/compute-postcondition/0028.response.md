Postcondition: ***`nCircles` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `ri` is a list of `nCircles` unique integers, `areas` is a list containing the squares of all radii in `ri` sorted in ascending order, `input` is an empty string, `totalArea` is the sum of the first and fourth elements of `areas` if `index` is 0, otherwise `totalArea` remains `a1 + (a4 - a3)`, `index` is 3, and `area` is the fifth element of `areas`.***
