The `sort()` method is called on the `areas` list, which sorts the elements in ascending order. The sorting does not affect the values of `nCircles`, `ri`, or `input`. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`nCircles` is an integer, `ri` is a list of `nCircles` unique integers, `areas` is a list containing the squares of all radii in `ri` sorted in ascending order, `input` is an empty string.**
