The code `areas.append(int(radius) * int(radius))` appends the square of the integer converted from the `radius` (which is part of the `input` string) to the `areas` list. 

Let's break down the impact:

- `areas` was initially a list containing the squares of the first radius in `ri` and the radius from the input string. After executing the code, the last element in `areas` will be updated to the square of the integer extracted from the `radius` in the input string.

Since the exact value of `radius` is not specified, let's denote it as `r`. Therefore, the last element of the `areas` list will be `r * r`.

The initial state variables remain unchanged except for the `areas` list.

Output State: **`nCircles` is an integer, `ri` is a list of `nCircles` unique integers, `areas` is a list containing the squares of the first radius in `ri` and the square of the integer from the input string, `input` is a string containing at least one more space-separated integer value**
