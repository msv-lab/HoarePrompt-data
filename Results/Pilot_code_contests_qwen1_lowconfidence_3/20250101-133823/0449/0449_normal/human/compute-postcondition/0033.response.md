Postcondition: ***`nCircles` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `ri` is a list of `nCircles` unique integers, `areas` is a list containing the squares of all radii in `ri` sorted in ascending order, `input` is an empty string, `totalArea` is `a1 + (a4 - a3) + areas[5]` if `index == 0`, otherwise `totalArea` is either `a1 + (a4 - a3) + (areas[4] - areas[3])` or `a1 + (a4 - a3)`, depending on whether `index % 2 == 0` is true, `index` is 4, and `area` is the sixth element of `areas`.***
