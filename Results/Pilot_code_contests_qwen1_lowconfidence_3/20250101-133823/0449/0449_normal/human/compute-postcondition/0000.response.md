The code reads an integer `nCircles` from standard input, which represents the number of concentric circles. This affects the variable `nCircles` by assigning it the value of the first line of input. The second line of input, which contains the radii of the circles, remains unaffected.

Output State: **The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of concentric circles. The second line contains n space-separated integers ri (1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000), representing the radii of the circles, where each ri is unique; `nCircles` is the integer value from the first line of input.**
