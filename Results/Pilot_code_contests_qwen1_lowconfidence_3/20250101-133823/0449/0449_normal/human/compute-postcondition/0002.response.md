The code `sys.stdout.write('0\n')` writes the string '0' to the standard output, but this does not affect the variables `nCircles` or `ri`. The precondition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nCircles` is an integer between 1 and 100, `ri` is a list of `nCircles` unique integers between 1 and 1000, `sys.stdout.write('0\n')` has been executed.**
