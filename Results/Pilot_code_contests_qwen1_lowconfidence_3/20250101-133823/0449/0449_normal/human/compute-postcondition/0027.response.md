Postcondition: ***`nCircles` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `ri` is a list of `nCircles` unique integers, `areas` is a list containing the squares of all radii in `ri` sorted in ascending order, `input` is an empty string, `totalArea` is `a1 + (a4 - a3)` if `index % 2 == 0`, and `index` is 3, `area` is the fifth element of `areas`. Otherwise, `totalArea` remains `a1 + (a4 - a3)` and `area` remains the fifth element of `areas`.***
