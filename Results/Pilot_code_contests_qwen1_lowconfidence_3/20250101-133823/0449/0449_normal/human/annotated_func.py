#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of concentric circles. The second line contains n space-separated integers ri (1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000), representing the radii of the circles, where each ri is unique.
def func():
    nCircles = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    if (nCircles < 1) :
        sys.stdout.write('0\n')
        sys.exit()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nCircles` is an integer, and `ri` is a list of `nCircles` unique integers. If `nCircles` is less than 1, the function writes '0' to stdout. Otherwise, no change is made to the program state.
    areas = []
    input = sys.stdin.readline()
    for radius in input.split(' '):
        areas.append(int(radius) * int(radius))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nCircles` is an integer, `ri` is a list of `nCircles` unique integers, `areas` is a list containing the squares of all radii in `ri`, `input` is an empty string.
    areas.sort()
    totalArea = 0
    for (index, area) in enumerate(areas):
        if index == 0:
            totalArea += area
        elif index % 2 == 0:
            totalArea += areas[index] - areas[index - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nCircles` is an integer, `ri` is a list of `nCircles` unique integers, `areas` is a list containing the squares of all radii in `ri` sorted in ascending order, `input` is an empty string, `totalArea` is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in `areas` starting from the first element, `index` is `nCircles` if the loop executed, otherwise `index` is 0 and `totalArea` is still 0.
    totalArea *= math.pi
    sys.stdout.write(str(totalArea) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two lines of input from stdin. The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of concentric circles. The second line contains `n` space-separated integers `ri` (1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000), representing the radii of the circles, where each `ri` is unique. It then calculates the sum of the areas of these concentric circles, considering only the difference between consecutive radii squared multiplied by π. If `n` is less than 1, it outputs 0. The function writes the final calculated area to stdout.
