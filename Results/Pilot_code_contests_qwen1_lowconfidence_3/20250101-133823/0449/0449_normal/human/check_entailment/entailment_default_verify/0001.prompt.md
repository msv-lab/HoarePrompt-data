You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, as Sherlock Holmes was tracking down one very important criminal, he found a wonderful painting on the wall. This wall could be represented as a plane. The painting had several concentric circles that divided the wall into several parts. Some parts were painted red and all the other were painted blue. Besides, any two neighboring parts were painted different colors, that is, the red and the blue color were alternating, i. e. followed one after the other. The outer area of the wall (the area that lied outside all circles) was painted blue. Help Sherlock Holmes determine the total area of red parts of the wall.

Let us remind you that two circles are called concentric if their centers coincide. Several circles are called concentric if any two of them are concentric.

Input

The first line contains the single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line contains n space-separated integers ri (1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000) — the circles' radii. It is guaranteed that all circles are different.

Output

Print the single real number — total area of the part of the wall that is painted red. The answer is accepted if absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 4.

Note

In the first sample the picture is just one circle of radius 1. Inner part of the circle is painted red. The area of the red part equals π × 12 = π.

In the second sample there are three circles of radii 1, 4 and 2. Outside part of the second circle is painted blue. Part between the second and the third circles is painted red. Part between the first and the third is painted blue. And, finally, the inner part of the first circle is painted red. Overall there are two red parts: the ring between the second and the third circles and the inner part of the first circle. Total area of the red parts is equal (π × 42 - π × 22) + π × 12 = π × 12 + π = 13π
Program:
```
import sys
import math

def func():
    nCircles = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    if nCircles < 1:
        sys.stdout.write('0\n')
        sys.exit()
    areas = []
    input = sys.stdin.readline()
    for radius in input.split(' '):
        areas.append(int(radius) * int(radius))
    areas.sort()
    totalArea = 0
    for (index, area) in enumerate(areas):
        if index == 0:
            totalArea += area
        elif index % 2 == 0:
            totalArea += areas[index] - areas[index - 1]
    totalArea *= math.pi
    sys.stdout.write(str(totalArea) + '\n')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly calculates the total area of the red parts of the wall based on the given problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of circles (`nCircles`) and their radii from the standard input. It ensures `nCircles` is at least 1, which is a valid constraint.

2. **Area Calculation**: The program computes the areas of the squares of the radii and sorts them. It then iterates through these areas, adding the appropriate segments based on whether the segment is red or blue. For odd indices, it adds the difference between consecutive areas; for even indices (starting from the first), it simply adds the area.

3. **Red Area Calculation**: The program correctly identifies the areas to be added as red by considering the alternating nature of the colors. It adds the area of the smallest circle and the difference between consecutive circles for even indices.

4. **Output**: The final total area is multiplied by `π` and printed with the required precision.

Since the program handles all described cases correctly and no potential edge cases or examples contradict its functionality, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two lines of input from stdin. The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of concentric circles. The second line contains `n` space-separated integers `ri` (1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000), representing the radii of the circles, where each `ri` is unique. It then calculates the sum of the areas of these concentric circles, considering only the difference between consecutive radii squared multiplied by π. If `n` is less than 1, it outputs 0. The function writes the final calculated area to stdout.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
