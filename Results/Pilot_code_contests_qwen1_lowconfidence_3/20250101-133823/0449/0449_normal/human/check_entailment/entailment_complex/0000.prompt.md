You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: One day, as Sherlock Holmes was tracking down one very important criminal, he found a wonderful painting on the wall. This wall could be represented as a plane. The painting had several concentric circles that divided the wall into several parts. Some parts were painted red and all the other were painted blue. Besides, any two neighboring parts were painted different colors, that is, the red and the blue color were alternating, i. e. followed one after the other. The outer area of the wall (the area that lied outside all circles) was painted blue. Help Sherlock Holmes determine the total area of red parts of the wall.

Let us remind you that two circles are called concentric if their centers coincide. Several circles are called concentric if any two of them are concentric.

Input

The first line contains the single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line contains n space-separated integers ri (1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000) — the circles' radii. It is guaranteed that all circles are different.

Output

Print the single real number — total area of the part of the wall that is painted red. The answer is accepted if absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 4.

Note

In the first sample the picture is just one circle of radius 1. Inner part of the circle is painted red. The area of the red part equals π × 12 = π.

In the second sample there are three circles of radii 1, 4 and 2. Outside part of the second circle is painted blue. Part between the second and the third circles is painted red. Part between the first and the third is painted blue. And, finally, the inner part of the first circle is painted red. Overall there are two red parts: the ring between the second and the third circles and the inner part of the first circle. Total area of the red parts is equal (π × 42 - π × 22) + π × 12 = π × 12 + π = 13π
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of concentric circles. The second line contains n space-separated integers ri (1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000), representing the radii of the circles, where each ri is unique.
def func():
    nCircles = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    if (nCircles < 1) :
        sys.stdout.write('0\n')
        sys.exit()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nCircles` is an integer, and `ri` is a list of `nCircles` unique integers. If `nCircles` is less than 1, the function writes '0' to stdout. Otherwise, no change is made to the program state.
    areas = []
    input = sys.stdin.readline()
    for radius in input.split(' '):
        areas.append(int(radius) * int(radius))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nCircles` is an integer, `ri` is a list of `nCircles` unique integers, `areas` is a list containing the squares of all radii in `ri`, `input` is an empty string.
    areas.sort()
    totalArea = 0
    for (index, area) in enumerate(areas):
        if index == 0:
            totalArea += area
        elif index % 2 == 0:
            totalArea += areas[index] - areas[index - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nCircles` is an integer, `ri` is a list of `nCircles` unique integers, `areas` is a list containing the squares of all radii in `ri` sorted in ascending order, `input` is an empty string, `totalArea` is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in `areas` starting from the first element, `index` is `nCircles` if the loop executed, otherwise `index` is 0 and `totalArea` is still 0.
    totalArea *= math.pi
    sys.stdout.write(str(totalArea) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two lines of input from stdin. The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of concentric circles. The second line contains `n` space-separated integers `ri` (1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000), representing the radii of the circles, where each `ri` is unique. It then calculates the sum of the areas of these concentric circles, considering only the difference between consecutive radii squared multiplied by π. If `n` is less than 1, it outputs 0. The function writes the final calculated area to stdout.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
