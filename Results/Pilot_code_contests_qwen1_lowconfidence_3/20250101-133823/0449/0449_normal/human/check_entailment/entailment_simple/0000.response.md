Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of circles (`nCircles`) and their radii from standard input.
   - It checks if `nCircles` is less than 1 and handles this case by printing `0` and exiting. This is consistent with the problem description which states that the input should be valid (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

2. **Calculating Areas:**
   - The program stores the squared values of the radii in the `areas` list.
   - These squared values represent the areas of the circles if they were painted blue.

3. **Sorting Areas:**
   - The `areas` list is sorted in ascending order. This is necessary because the problem requires alternating colors, starting with the outermost area being blue.

4. **Calculating Red Area:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted `areas` list and calculates the total area of the red parts.
   - For the first element, it adds the area directly.
   - For subsequent elements, it adds the difference between the current area and the previous area if the index is even (since even indices correspond to red areas according to the problem statement).

5. **Multiplying by Pi:**
   - After calculating the total red area in square units, the program multiplies it by `math.pi` to get the actual area in terms of π.

6. **Output:**
   - The result is printed to the standard output with the appropriate formatting.

Given these steps, the program accurately follows the problem description and performs the necessary calculations to determine the total area of the red parts of the wall. Therefore, the program is correct.
