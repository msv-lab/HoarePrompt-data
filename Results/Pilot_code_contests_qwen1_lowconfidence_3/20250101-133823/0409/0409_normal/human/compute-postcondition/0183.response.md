`magic_tick` is assigned the value `marks[i] + shift_x`. The values of `i` and `j` are not affected by this operation since the condition `i >= n or j >= n` prevents any changes to `i` and `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` and `j` are integers; `magic_tick` is `marks[i] + shift_x`.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are integers; `magic_tick` is `marks[i] + shift_x`**
