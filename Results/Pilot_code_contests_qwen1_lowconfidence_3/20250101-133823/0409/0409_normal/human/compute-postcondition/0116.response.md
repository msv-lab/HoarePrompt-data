`j` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains 1, and the condition `(marks[i] + shift_x < 0 or marks[i] + shift_x > l)` is still true. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `(marks[i] + shift_x < 0 or marks[i] + shift_x > l)` is true.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `(marks[i] + shift_x < 0 or marks[i] + shift_x > l)` is true**
