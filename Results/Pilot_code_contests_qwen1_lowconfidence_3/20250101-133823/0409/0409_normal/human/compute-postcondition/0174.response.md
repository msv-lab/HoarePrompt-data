`j` is incremented by 1. The initial condition states that either `i + 1 >= n` or `j >= n` is still true. Since `j` was already greater than or equal to `n`, incrementing `j` by 1 will make `j` one more than `n`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `magic_tick` also remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, `magic_tick` remains either undefined or set to `marks[0] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[0] + shift_x <= l`.**
