`magic_tick` is assigned the value `marks[i] + shift_x`. Based on the initial state, `marks[i] + shift_x` is within the range [0, l] and `marks[i] + shift_x <= l`. No other variables are affected. 

Output State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `magic_tick` is `marks[i] + shift_x`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`, `marks[i] + shift_x` is within the range [0, l], and `marks[i] + shift_x <= l`.**
