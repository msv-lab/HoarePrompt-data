The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition. Therefore, the updated state is as follows:

- `res_x` and `res_y` are within the range [0, n-1]
- `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False`
- `i` is now `i + 1` (since `i` was initially either `n+1` or greater than or equal to `n`)
- `j` is either `n` or remains `j` (initially greater than or equal to `n`)
- `mark` is `marks[n-1]`
- `x` is `res_x`
- `y` is `res_y`
- The condition `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y` still holds.

Output State: **`res_x` and `res_y` are within the range [0, n-1]; `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False`; `i` is `i + 1`; `j` is either `n` or remains `j` (initially greater than or equal to `n`); `mark` is `marks[n-1]`; `x` is `res_x`; `y` is `res_y`; the condition `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y` still holds.**
