Postcondition: **`i` and `j` are integers such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is still true; `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`. If the condition `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` is met, `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and `magic_tick` remains unchanged as either undefined or set to `marks[0] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[0] + shift_x <= l`.**
