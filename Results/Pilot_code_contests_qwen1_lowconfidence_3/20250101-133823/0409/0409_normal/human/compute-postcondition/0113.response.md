The `break` statement is used to exit the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block directly associated with the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not alter the values of any variables. It simply indicates that the execution would exit the current context, but no actual changes are made to the variables.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `marks[i] + shift_x` is within the range `[0, l]`, `magic_tick` is equal to `marks[i] + shift_x`, and `(marks[i] + shift_x >= marks[j] + shift_y)` is true.**
