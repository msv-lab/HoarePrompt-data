The code snippet `print(1)` prints the number 1 to the console. This does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`res_x` and `res_y` are within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False`, `i` and `j` are indices such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is true, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `x` is `res_x` and `y` is `res_y`, `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` if a valid solution is found, otherwise `magic_tick` is `None`, and the number 1 is printed to the console.**
