The code `print(x)` prints the value of the variable `x`. However, in the initial state, `x` is not defined directly. We only know about `res_x` which is within the range [0, n-1]. Since the code simply prints `x` without reassigning it, the value of `x` printed will be the same as the value of `res_x`.

Output State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` is True, `y_solved` is False, `i` is `n`, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `magic_tick` is None, print output is `res_x`**
