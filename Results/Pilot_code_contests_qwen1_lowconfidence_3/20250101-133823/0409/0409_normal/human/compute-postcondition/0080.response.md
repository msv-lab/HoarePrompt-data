The code `break` is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where it was defined. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned in the provided code snippet, we assume it is breaking out of a loop or conditional block.

The variables `res_x`, `res_y`, `x_solved`, `y_solved`, `i`, `j`, `mark`, `x`, `y`, and `magic_tick` are not directly modified by the `break` statement. Therefore, their states remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the loop or conditional block.

Output State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`, `magic_tick` is `marks[i] + shift_x`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
