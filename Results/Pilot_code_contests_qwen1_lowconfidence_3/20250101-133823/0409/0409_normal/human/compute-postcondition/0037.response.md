The code sets `x_solved` to `True`. This does not affect the values of `res_x`, `i`, `mark`, `res_y`, `y_solved`, or the ranges in which they exist. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `i` is 2, `mark` is `marks[1]`, `res_y` is the minimum of the maximum of 0 and the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(marks, mark + y, lo=i)`, `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], and `x_solved` is `True`, `y_solved` remains as per the precondition.**
