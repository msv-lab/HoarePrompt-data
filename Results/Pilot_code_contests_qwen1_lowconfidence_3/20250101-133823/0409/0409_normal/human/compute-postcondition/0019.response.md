Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop iterates over the `marks` list using `enumerate`.
- The loop variable `i` represents the index, and `mark` represents the value at that index.
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is as follows:
  - `res_y` is the minimum of the maximum of 0 and `res_y`, and `n - 1`.
  - If `marks[res_y]` equals `mark + y`, then `x_solved` and `y_solved` are both set to `True`.
  - Otherwise, the values of `x_solved` and `y_solved` remain unchanged.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is based on the index `i`, which starts from 0 and goes up to the length of the `marks` list minus one (`len(marks) - 1`).
2. **Current Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `res_y` is updated to be the minimum of the maximum of 0 and `res_y`, and `n - 1`.
   - Depending on the current `mark`, either `x_solved` and `y_solved` are set to `True` or remain unchanged.

### Steps to Determine the Next Iteration State:
1. **Determine the Next Index**: The next index `i` for the loop will be `previous_i + 1`.
2. **Determine the Next `mark`**: The next `mark` will be `marks[previous_i + 1]`.
3. **Update `res_y`**: The new value of `res_y` will depend on the maximum of 0 and `res_y` from the previous iteration, and `n - 1`.

Since we do not have the exact value of `res_y` from the previous iteration, we only know its range:
- `res_y` is the minimum of the maximum of 0 and `res_y`, and `n - 1`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time:
- The loop index `i` will be incremented by 1.
- The `mark` for the next iteration will be `marks[i]`.

Given that no specific values of `res_y`, `x_solved`, and `y_solved` were mentioned, they remain unchanged unless explicitly set to `True` inside the loop.

### Final Answer:
State: **`res_y` is the minimum of the maximum of 0 and `res_y`, and `n - 1`; if `marks[res_y]` equals `mark + y`, then `x_solved` and `y_solved` are both True. Otherwise, the values of `x_solved` and `y_solved` remain unchanged; `i` is increased by 1; `mark` is `marks[i]`**.

In simpler terms:
State: **`res_y` is the minimum of the maximum of 0 and `res_y`, and `n - 1`; `i` is 0 (or previous_i + 1), `mark` is `marks[i]`**.

Note: The exact initial values of `res_y`, `x_solved`, and `y_solved` would be needed to provide a precise numerical state, but the structure remains the same.
