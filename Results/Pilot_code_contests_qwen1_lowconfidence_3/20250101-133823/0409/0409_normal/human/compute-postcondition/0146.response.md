The initial state is defined such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n`, and `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`. The code snippet sets `i` and `j` to `0`.

- `i` is initially either greater than or equal to `n`, but now it is explicitly set to `0`.
- `j` is initially either greater than or equal to `n`, but now it is explicitly set to `0`.
- The value of `magic_tick` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is still true, `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[0] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[0] + shift_x <= l`.**
