Postcondition: ***`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `i` is 2, `mark` is `marks[1]`, and `res_y` is the minimum of the maximum of 0 and `res_y`, and `n - 1`. If `mark + x > l`, then `y_solved` is True if `marks[res_y] == mark + x` otherwise False, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `y_solved` remains as per the precondition.***
