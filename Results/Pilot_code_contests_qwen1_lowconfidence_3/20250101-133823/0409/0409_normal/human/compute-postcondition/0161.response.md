The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 0, so after incrementing, `i` becomes 1. The conditions `either i >= n or j >= n` and the value of `magic_tick` remain unchanged since no operations affecting these variables are performed. The condition `(0 <= marks[i] + shift_x > l)` is true, which implies that `i` was already 0, and thus this condition still holds true for `i` now being 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0, either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is still true, `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[0] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[0] + shift_x <= l`, and the condition `(0 <= marks[i] + shift_x > l)` is true.**
