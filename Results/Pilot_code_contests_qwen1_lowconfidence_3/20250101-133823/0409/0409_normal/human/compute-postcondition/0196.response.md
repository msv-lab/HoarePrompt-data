The code `print(2)` does not affect any of the variables listed in the initial state. It only prints the number 2 to the console. The output of the print statement is shown but does not change any of the variables.

Output State: **`res_x` and `res_y` are within the range `[0, n-1]`, `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False`, `i` and `j` are indices such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is true, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `x` is `res_x` and `y` is `res_y`, `magic_tick` is `None`.**
