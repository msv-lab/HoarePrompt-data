The code prints the values of `x` and `y`. Given the initial state, `x` is equal to `res_x` and `y` is equal to `res_y`. After printing, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, but they are now known to be within the range `[0, n-1]`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`res_x` and `res_y` are within the range `[0, n-1]`, `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False`, `i` and `j` are indices such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is true, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`, `magic_tick` is `None`, and the output of the print statement is `%i %i` where `%i` represents the values of `res_x` and `res_y`.
