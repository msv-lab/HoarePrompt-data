The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is initially greater than or equal to `n`. After incrementing, `i` will still be greater than or equal to `n` because adding 1 to a number that is already greater than or equal to `n` will still keep it greater than or equal to `n`.

The values of the other variables (`res_x`, `res_y`, `x_solved`, `y_solved`, `j`, `mark`, `magic_tick`, `x`, `y`, and the condition `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `i` is greater than or equal to `n` + 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `magic_tick` is `None`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`, and `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`**.
