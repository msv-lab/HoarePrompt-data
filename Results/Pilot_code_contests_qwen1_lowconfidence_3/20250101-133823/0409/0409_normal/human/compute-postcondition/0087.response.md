The code `break` is used to exit a loop, but in this context, there is no loop present. The `break` statement does not change any variable values and simply indicates the end of a loop or conditional block. Since no loop or conditional block is specified, the variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`res_x` and `res_y` are within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False`, `i` is either `n+1` or remains `i` (initially greater than or equal to `n`), `j` is either `n` or remains `j` (initially greater than or equal to `n`), `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`, and `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`.**
