The code `magic_tick = marks[i] + shift_x` assigns the value of `marks[i] + shift_x` to the variable `magic_tick`. Given that `i >= n` and `j >= n` always evaluate to true, the value of `i` and `j` do not affect the current variables. The only variable directly modified is `magic_tick`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`, `magic_tick` is `marks[i] + shift_x**
