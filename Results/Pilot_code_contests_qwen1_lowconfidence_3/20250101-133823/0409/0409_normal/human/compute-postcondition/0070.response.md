`j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `n+1` to `n+2`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `i` is `n+1`, `j` is `n+2`, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `magic_tick` is `None`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
