The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 0, so after executing `i += 1`, `i` becomes 1. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0, either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is still true, `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[0] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[0] + shift_x <= l`, the condition `(marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y)` is true.**
