The code `x_solved = True` simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `x_solved`. This does not affect the values of `res_y` or `marks[res_x]`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`res_y` is the minimum of the maximum of 0 and `res_y`, and `n - 1`; `marks[res_x]` is equal to `mark + x`; `x_solved` is True.**
