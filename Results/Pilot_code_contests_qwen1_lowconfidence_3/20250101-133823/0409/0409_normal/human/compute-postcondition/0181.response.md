`j` is incremented by 1, meaning its new value is its previous value plus 1. The condition given in the initial state ensures that `i` and `j` are not modified if they meet certain criteria. Thus, the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are integers; `j` is increased by 1**
