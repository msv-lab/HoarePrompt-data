`j` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition for breaking out of the loop (if `i >= n` or `j >= n`) is not evaluated or affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` and `j` are indices; `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are indices; `j` is increased by 1**
