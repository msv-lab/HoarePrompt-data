Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is 0, either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is still true, `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[0] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[0] + shift_x <= l`. If `i >= n` or `j >= n` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block. There is no other change in the state of the program.***
