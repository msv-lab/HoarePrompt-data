Postcondition: ***`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`. If `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, no changes occur. Otherwise, if `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is incremented to `n+1` and `j` is set to `n`.***
