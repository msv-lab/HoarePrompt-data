`y_solved` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `res_y`, `n`, `marks`, `res_y`, `mark`, and `y_solved` are updated. The value of `x_solved` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`res_y` is the minimum of the maximum of 0 and `res_y`, and `n - 1`; `marks[res_y]` is equal to `mark + y`; `x_solved` is True if `marks[res_y]` equals `mark + y`; `y_solved` is True**
