`j` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is `i + 1`, which means it was already incremented before this line of code. The other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions. Therefore, the output state is: `res_x` and `res_y` are within the range [0, n-1]; `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False`; `i` is `i + 1`; `j` is `j + 1` (initially greater than or equal to `n`); `mark` is `marks[n-1]`; `x` is `res_x`; `y` is `res_y`; the condition `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y` still holds.

Output State: **`res_x` and `res_y` are within the range [0, n-1]; `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False`; `i` is `i + 1`; `j` is `j + 1` (initially greater than or equal to `n`); `mark` is `marks[n-1]`; `x` is `res_x`; `y` is `res_y`; the condition `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y` still holds.**
