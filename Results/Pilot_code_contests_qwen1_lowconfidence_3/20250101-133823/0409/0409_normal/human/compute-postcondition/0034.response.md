Output State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `i` is 2, `mark` is `marks[1]`, `res_y` is the minimum of the maximum of 0 and the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(marks, mark + y, lo=i)`, `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is updated to the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(marks, mark + x, lo=i, hi=min(res_y + 1, n))`, and `y_solved` remains as per the precondition.**
