The code sets `y_solved` to `True`. This means that regardless of its previous value, `y_solved` is now explicitly set to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `i` is 2, `mark` is `marks[1]`, `res_y` is the minimum of the maximum of 0 and the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(marks, mark + y, lo=i)`, `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `y_solved` is `True`, and `x_solved` remains unchanged.**
