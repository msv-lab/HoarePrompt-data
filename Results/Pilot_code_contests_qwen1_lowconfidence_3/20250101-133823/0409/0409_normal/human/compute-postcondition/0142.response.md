Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are integers. If the condition `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y` is true, then `i` is incremented by 1, `j` remains unchanged, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n` remains the same. Otherwise, if `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, then `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x`. If this condition is not met, both `i` and `j` are incremented by 1.***

This postcondition captures both the if and else cases, ensuring that the relationships and values of the variables `i`, `j`, `marks`, `shift_x`, `shift_y`, `l`, and `magic_tick` are correctly described after the execution of the if-else block.
