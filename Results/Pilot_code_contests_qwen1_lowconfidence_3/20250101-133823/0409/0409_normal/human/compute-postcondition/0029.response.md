Postcondition: ***`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `i` is 1, `mark` is `marks[0]`, and `res_y` is the minimum of the maximum of 0 and `res_y`, and `n - 1`. If `marks[res_y] == mark + y`, then both `x_solved` and `y_solved` are True. Otherwise, the values of `res_x`, `i`, `mark`, `res_y`, and `y_solved` remain as per the precondition.***
