Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are integers. If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, then `j` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is incremented by 1, `j` remains unchanged, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n` remains the same. If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, then `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x`. Otherwise, both `i` and `j` are incremented by 1. Either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n` remains the same.***
