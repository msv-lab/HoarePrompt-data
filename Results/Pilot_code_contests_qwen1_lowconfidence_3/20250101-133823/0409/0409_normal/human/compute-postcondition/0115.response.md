`i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 0, so after executing `i += 1`, the value of `i` becomes 1. The other variables (`j` and the condition involving `marks[i] + shift_x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `(marks[i] + shift_x < 0 or marks[i] + shift_x > l)`**
