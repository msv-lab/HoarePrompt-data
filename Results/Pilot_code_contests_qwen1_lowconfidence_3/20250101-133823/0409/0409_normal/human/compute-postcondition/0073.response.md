Postcondition: ***`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`. If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, then nothing changes. Otherwise, if `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is greater than or equal to `n` + 1. If `marks[i] + shift_x` is within the range [0, l] and `marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, then `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x`; otherwise, `magic_tick` remains `None`.***
