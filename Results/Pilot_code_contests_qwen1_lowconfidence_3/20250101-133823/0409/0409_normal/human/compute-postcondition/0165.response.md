Postcondition: **`i` and `j` are integers such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is still true, and `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[0] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[0] + shift_x <= l`. If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 1. If `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is set to 1 and `j` is set to 0, and `magic_tick` remains either undefined or set to `marks[0] + shift_x`. If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, then `magic_tick` is equal to `marks[i] + shift_x` and `marks[i] + shift_x == marks[j] + shift_y`. Otherwise, `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and `magic_tick` remains either undefined or set to `marks[0] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[0] + shift_x <= l`.**
