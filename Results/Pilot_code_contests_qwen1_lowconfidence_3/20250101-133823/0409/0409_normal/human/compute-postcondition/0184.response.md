The code `break` does not change the values of any variables; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code, it simply ends the current context (implied to be within a loop or conditional block).

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are integers; `magic_tick` is `marks[i] + shift_x`.**
