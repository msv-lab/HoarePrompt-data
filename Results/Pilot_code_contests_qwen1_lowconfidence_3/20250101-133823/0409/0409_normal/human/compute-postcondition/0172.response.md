The code `break` does not modify any variables and is used to exit a loop or match statement. Since there is no loop or match statement currently active, the variables `i`, `j`, and `magic_tick` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are integers such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is still true; `magic_tick` is now `marks[i] + shift_x`.**
