The code assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `x_solved`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `marks`). Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is assigned values read from input, `l` is assigned values read from input, `x` is assigned values read from input, `y` is assigned values read from input, `marks` is a map object of integers read from the next line of input split and converted to integers, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; `x_solved` is False.**
