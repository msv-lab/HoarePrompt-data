Output State: **'i' and 'j' are indices such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n`, `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as both `i` and `j` are less than `n`.
- The loop increments `i` or `j` based on the comparison between `marks[i] + shift_x` and `marks[j] + shift_y`.
- If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, then `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x` and the loop breaks.
- If the condition `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` is never met, the loop will continue until either `i` or `j` reaches `n`, causing the loop to terminate.
- After the loop ends, `i` and `j` will satisfy the condition `i >= n` or `j >= n`. `magic_tick` will be defined only if the condition `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` was met during the loop execution.
