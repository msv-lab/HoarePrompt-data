`i` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` and the condition `either i >= n or j >= n` are not affected. The value of `magic_tick` remains either undefined or set to `marks[0] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[0] + shift_x <= l`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `j` is an integer such that either `i + 1 >= n` or `j >= n` is still true, and `magic_tick` remains either undefined or set to `marks[0] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[0] + shift_x <= l`.**
