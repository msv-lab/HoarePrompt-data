Postcondition: **`i` and `j` are indices. If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, then `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is increased by 1, `j` remains unchanged. If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, then `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x`. If neither condition is met, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1, and the loop or if statement may be broken if either `i >= n` or `j >= n`.**
