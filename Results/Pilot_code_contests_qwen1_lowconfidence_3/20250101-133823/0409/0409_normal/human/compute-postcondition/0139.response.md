`i` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` remains unchanged, and the condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement based on `i` or `j` being greater than or equal to `n` might or might not be met depending on the new value of `i`. However, since no explicit check or action related to this condition is performed in the given code snippet, the condition's validity remains as per the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `j` is unchanged**
