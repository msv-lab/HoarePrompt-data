The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged since no operation affects it. The condition to break out of the loop or if statement still holds based on the initial state.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are integers; `j` is increased by 1; if either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
