`i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The state of `j` remains unchanged, and the condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement (if `i >= n` or `j >= n`) still applies. 

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `j` is unchanged, and we may break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `i >= n` or `j >= n`.**
