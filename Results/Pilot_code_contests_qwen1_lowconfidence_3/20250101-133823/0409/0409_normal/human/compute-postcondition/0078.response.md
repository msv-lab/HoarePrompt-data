The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from being greater than or equal to `n` to now being `i = n + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code.

Output State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`.**
