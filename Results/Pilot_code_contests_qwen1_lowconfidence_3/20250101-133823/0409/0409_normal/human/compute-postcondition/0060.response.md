`j` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is as follows: `res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, `j` is greater than or equal to `n` plus 1, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `magic_tick` is `None`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`, and the condition `(marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y)` is no longer true because `j` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1]; `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1]; `x_solved` is `False`; `y_solved` is `False`; `i` is greater than or equal to `n`; `j` is greater than or equal to `n` plus 1; `mark` is `marks[n-1]`; `magic_tick` is `None`; `x` is `res_x`; `y` is `res_y`; the condition `(marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y)` is false.**
