Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are integers such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is still true, and `magic_tick` remains either undefined or set to `marks[0] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[0] + shift_x <= l`. If `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x` if the condition `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` is met, otherwise `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is incremented by 1.***
