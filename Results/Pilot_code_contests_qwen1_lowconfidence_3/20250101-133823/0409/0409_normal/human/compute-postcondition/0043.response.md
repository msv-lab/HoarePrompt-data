The code `print(0)` does not affect any variables directly. It only prints the integer `0` to the console. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` and `y_solved` are both True, `i` is `n`, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `magic_tick` is None, print statement outputs `0`**
