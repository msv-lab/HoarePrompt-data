You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for completing the overall postcondition of Hoare triples for if statements based on the postconditions of the if and the else part. In addition to the Hoare triples, you will also see the postconditions for the if and else parts. Each Hoare triple is made up of three components: a precondition, a program fragment, and a postcondition. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before the execution of the program fragment. This description should only include the values of the variables, without detailing the operational aspects of the program.

Program Fragment: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This contains the condition of the if statement and if there is an else part there will also be an else: in the program fragment.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the program fragment with the initial state described in the precondition. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. You need to strictly follow the format and summarize the if statement in a coherent paragraph, rather than discussing it in separate paragraphs.

The if part : the postcondition of the if part

The else part : the postcondition of the else part

Combine the postconditions of the if and else part(if an else exists), taking into account the if condition,  to get the overall postcondition of the if else block

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
Program Fragment:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```
If part: `str` is a string with lenght less than 3, the function returns None
Else part: there is no else part in the code

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, if the length of `str` is less then 3, the function return None***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
Program Fragment:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
    
else:
    
```

If part: n is an integer of any value and the function returns `n`
Else part: n can have any value except an integer one and the function returns `int(n)`

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***if `n` is integer, then the function returns `n` itself. Otherwise, the function return `int(n)`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
Program Fragment:
```
if x < 2:
   
else:
    
```

If part: `x` is an positive integer less than 2, the function returns False
Else part: `x` is an positive integer larger or equal to 2 and the function returns True

Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive integer, if x is less then 2, the function return False. Otherwise, the function return True***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer
Program Fragment:
```
if n < 0:
    
else:
    
```
if part: the integer n was originally negative and `n` is updated to its negation. Integer `m` is increased by 1
else part: if n is 0 then return m , otherwise the integer `n` is decreased by 13. Integer `m` is increased by 1

Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. If n < 0, `m` is increased by 1 and `n` is negated. If n == 0, the function returns `m`. Otherwise, `n` is decreased by 13 and `m` is increased by 1.***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, y is zero.
Program Fragment:
```
if x > 0:
```
If part: `x` is a positive integer, if `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. Otherwise, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.
Else part: there is no else part in the code

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer. If `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. If x is larger than 0 but lower than 10, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.***

Your Task:
Precondition: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step and consider the possible outcomes based on the loop structure and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

### Loop Analysis

1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `shift_x`, `shift_y` being set to `(res_x, res_y)`, `(-res_x, res_y)`, `(res_x, -res_y)`, or `(res_x, res_y)` respectively. This means `i` and `j` are reset to 0 for each iteration.

2. **Inner Loop Execution**:
   - The inner `while` loop runs as long as both `i` and `j` are less than `n`.
   - The conditions inside the `while` loop involve comparing `marks[i] + shift_x` and `marks[j] + shift_y`.
   - If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, `j` is incremented.
   - If `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, `i` is incremented.
   - If `marks[i] + shift_x == marks[j] + shift_y` and `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, `magic_tick` is set to this value and the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, both `i` and `j` are incremented.

3. **Outer Loop Execution**:
   - The outer loop runs through all four combinations of `shift_x` and `shift_y`.

### Considering the Provided Output States

- After the first iteration of the outer loop:
  - `res_x` and `res_y` are within the range `[0, n-1]`.
  - `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False`.
  - Either `i` and `j` are `n` or one of them is `n`.
  - `mark` is `marks[n-1]`.
  - `x` is `res_x` and `y` is `res_y`.
  - `magic_tick` is either set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` or `None`.

- After the second iteration of the outer loop:
  - `i` and `j` are indices such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n`.
  - `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`.

- After the third iteration of the outer loop:
  - Either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is true.
  - `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` and `marks[i] + shift_x == marks[j] + shift_y`.

### Final Output State

From the above analysis, we can deduce the following:

- If the loop completes all its iterations, it will have checked all possible shifts `(res_x, res_y)`, `(-res_x, res_y)`, `(res_x, -res_y)`, and `(res_x, res_y)`.
- If `magic_tick` is set during any of these iterations, it means a valid `magic_tick` was found.
- If no valid `magic_tick` is found after all iterations, `magic_tick` will remain `None`.

Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, we can conclude:

**Output State:**
- `res_x` and `res_y` are within the range `[0, n-1]`.
- `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False` until a valid solution is found.
- `i` and `j` are indices such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is true.
- `mark` is `marks[n-1]`.
- `x` is `res_x` and `y` is `res_y`.
- `magic_tick` is either set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` or `None` if no such value is found.

This covers the state of all variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.
Program Fragment:
```
if magic_tick:
else:

```
if part: `res_x` and `res_y` are within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False`, `i` and `j` are indices such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is true, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `x` is `res_x` and `y` is `res_y`, `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` if a valid solution is found, otherwise `magic_tick` is `None`, and `1` is printed to the console.
else part: The code prints the values of `x` and `y`. Given the initial state, `x` is equal to `res_x` and `y` is equal to `res_y`. After printing, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, but they are now known to be within the range `[0, n-1]`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`res_x` and `res_y` are within the range `[0, n-1]`, `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False`, `i` and `j` are indices such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is true, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`, `magic_tick` is `None`, and the output of the print statement is `%i %i` where `%i` represents the values of `res_x` and `res_y`.

Your task is to complete the overall postcondition of the whole if else block. Summarise all the cases and give the overall state of the program after the if else executes. Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**
