The code reads four integers from standard input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`. These values are split from a single line of input using `map(int, sys.stdin.next().split())`. Since the exact values of these variables are not specified in the initial state, we will represent them as the values read from the input.

The initial conditions are that `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are positive integers with the constraints \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), and \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\). After executing the code, these constraints are still valid, but the actual values of the variables are now defined by the input.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values read from the input, and they satisfy the conditions 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l.**
