Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are integers such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is still true. `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[0] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[0] + shift_x <= l`. If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, then `magic_tick` is equal to `marks[i] + shift_x` and `(marks[i] + shift_x == marks[j] + shift_y)` is true. Otherwise, `i` is set to 1, `j` is set to 1, and `magic_tick` remains either undefined or set to `marks[0] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[0] + shift_x <= l`.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts and their respective conditions.
