Let's analyze the given program state and the `while True` loop to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once.

### Given State Before the Loop:
- `res_x` is within the range [0, n-1]
- `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1]
- `x_solved` is `False`
- `y_solved` is `False`
- `i` is `0`
- `j` is `0`
- `mark` is `marks[n-1]`
- `magic_tick` is `None`
- `x` is `res_x`
- `y` is `res_y`

### Analysis:
The `while True` loop will continue indefinitely as long as it is not explicitly broken out of. Therefore, we don't need to adjust any specific state for the loop to execute at least once. The loop will always execute because it is a `while True` loop.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute at least one time regardless of the current state. Thus, no adjustments to the states are necessary.

### Answer:
State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `0`, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `magic_tick` is `None`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`**
