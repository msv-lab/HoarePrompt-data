To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will continue executing.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` and `j` are indices such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n`.
   - `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over tuples `(shift_x, shift_y)` defined as `[(x, y), (-x, y), (x, -y), (x, y)]`.

3. **Determine the Next Tuple:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over a fixed set of tuples, the loop will continue if the current tuple has not been fully processed yet.
   - There are 4 tuples in the list: `(x, y)`, `(-x, y)`, `(x, -y)`, `(x, y)`. The loop will repeat until all these tuples are exhausted.

4. **Condition for Loop Continuation:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are more tuples in the list to process.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since the loop is dependent on the tuples in the list, the only thing that changes between iterations is the current tuple being processed.
   - After processing one tuple, the loop will move to the next tuple in the list.

6. **New State:**
   - The state remains the same for `i` and `j` because the problem does not specify any change in these indices within the loop.
   - `magic_tick` remains the same unless it is updated within the loop body, but since the problem does not mention updating `magic_tick`, it remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:
The state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is the same as the end of the previous iteration because no new information about `i`, `j`, or `magic_tick` is provided. The only thing that changes is the tuple being processed.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` and `j` are indices such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n`, `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`.**

This indicates that the loop can continue because there are still tuples to process in the list.
