The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or block. Since there is no loop or block context in the given code snippet, the values of `i`, `j`, and `magic_tick` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are integers such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is still true, and `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[0] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[0] + shift_x <= l`.**
