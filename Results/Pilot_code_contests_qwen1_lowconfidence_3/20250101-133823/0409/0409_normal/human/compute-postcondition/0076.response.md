Postcondition: ***`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`. Since the condition `i >= n or j >= n` always evaluates to true, the if part is executed and no changes occur in the variables.***
