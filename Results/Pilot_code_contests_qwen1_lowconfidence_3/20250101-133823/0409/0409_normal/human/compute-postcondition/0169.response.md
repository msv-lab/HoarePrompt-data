The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` and the condition that either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is still true remain unchanged. The value of `magic_tick` also remains unchanged, either being undefined or set to `marks[0] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[0] + shift_x <= l`.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are integers such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is still true, `j` is increased by 1, and `magic_tick` remains either undefined or set to `marks[0] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[0] + shift_x <= l`.**
