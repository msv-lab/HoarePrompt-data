The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` is greater than or equal to `n`. After incrementing, `i` will be exactly `n+1` since `i` was initially at least `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `i` is `n+1`, `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `magic_tick` is `None`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `marks[i] + shift_x > l` or `marks[i] + shift_x < 0`**
