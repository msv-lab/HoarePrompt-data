The code snippet `res_y = min(max(0, res_y), n - 1)` impacts the variable `res_y`. It ensures that `res_y` is clamped between 0 and `n - 1`. Since the initial state specifies that `res_y` is the minimum of the maximum of 0 and `res_y`, and `n - 1`, this operation does not change the value of `res_y` because it was already within the range [0, n-1].

Therefore, the value of `res_y` remains unchanged. All other variables (`res_x`, `i`, and `mark`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `i` is 1, `mark` is `marks[0]`, and `res_y` is the minimum of the maximum of 0 and `res_y`, and `n - 1`.**
