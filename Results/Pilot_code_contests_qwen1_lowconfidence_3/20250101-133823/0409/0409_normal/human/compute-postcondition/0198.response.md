Postcondition: **`res_x` and `res_y` are within the range `[0, n-1]`, `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False`, `i` and `j` are indices such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is true, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `x` is `res_x` and `y` is `res_y`. If a valid `magic_tick` is found, `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` and `1` is printed to the console. Otherwise, `magic_tick` remains `None` and the values of `x` and `y` are printed to the console.**
