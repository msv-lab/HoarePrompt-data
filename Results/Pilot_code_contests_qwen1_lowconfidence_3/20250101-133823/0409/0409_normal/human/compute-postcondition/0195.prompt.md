You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an else statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account that the program does not enter the if block and goes to the lese block instead. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement. WE DO NOT FOLLOW THE IF CONDITION IN THIS CASE. WE ENTER THE ELSE BLOCK.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after not entering the if block and instead enetering the else block . So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is false. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is more than or equal to 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` can have any value except an integer one`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive larger or equal to 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, a is a list of integers
if condition:
```
if n <=0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. n is larger than 0, a is a list of integers***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step and consider the possible outcomes based on the loop structure and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

### Loop Analysis

1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `shift_x`, `shift_y` being set to `(res_x, res_y)`, `(-res_x, res_y)`, `(res_x, -res_y)`, or `(res_x, res_y)` respectively. This means `i` and `j` are reset to 0 for each iteration.

2. **Inner Loop Execution**:
   - The inner `while` loop runs as long as both `i` and `j` are less than `n`.
   - The conditions inside the `while` loop involve comparing `marks[i] + shift_x` and `marks[j] + shift_y`.
   - If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, `j` is incremented.
   - If `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, `i` is incremented.
   - If `marks[i] + shift_x == marks[j] + shift_y` and `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, `magic_tick` is set to this value and the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, both `i` and `j` are incremented.

3. **Outer Loop Execution**:
   - The outer loop runs through all four combinations of `shift_x` and `shift_y`.

### Considering the Provided Output States

- After the first iteration of the outer loop:
  - `res_x` and `res_y` are within the range `[0, n-1]`.
  - `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False`.
  - Either `i` and `j` are `n` or one of them is `n`.
  - `mark` is `marks[n-1]`.
  - `x` is `res_x` and `y` is `res_y`.
  - `magic_tick` is either set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` or `None`.

- After the second iteration of the outer loop:
  - `i` and `j` are indices such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n`.
  - `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`.

- After the third iteration of the outer loop:
  - Either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is true.
  - `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` and `marks[i] + shift_x == marks[j] + shift_y`.

### Final Output State

From the above analysis, we can deduce the following:

- If the loop completes all its iterations, it will have checked all possible shifts `(res_x, res_y)`, `(-res_x, res_y)`, `(res_x, -res_y)`, and `(res_x, res_y)`.
- If `magic_tick` is set during any of these iterations, it means a valid `magic_tick` was found.
- If no valid `magic_tick` is found after all iterations, `magic_tick` will remain `None`.

Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, we can conclude:

**Output State:**
- `res_x` and `res_y` are within the range `[0, n-1]`.
- `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False` until a valid solution is found.
- `i` and `j` are indices such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is true.
- `mark` is `marks[n-1]`.
- `x` is `res_x` and `y` is `res_y`.
- `magic_tick` is either set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` or `None` if no such value is found.

This covers the state of all variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.
if condition:
```
if (magic_tick):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition .All the information of the precondition must be included in the postcondition and additionally the negation of the if condition must also be included. Give the overall state of the program for the program after it does not enter the if condition and instead enters the else.
