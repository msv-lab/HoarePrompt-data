`i` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `i` is greater than or equal to `n+1`, `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`.

Output State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `i` is greater than or equal to `n+1`, `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`.**
