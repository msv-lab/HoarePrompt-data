`y_solved` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of `res_x`, `i`, `mark`, or `res_y`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `i` is 1, `mark` is `marks[0]`, and `res_y` is the minimum of the maximum of 0 and `res_y`, and `n - 1`. If `marks[res_x] == mark + x`, then `x_solved` is True. `y_solved` is True.**
