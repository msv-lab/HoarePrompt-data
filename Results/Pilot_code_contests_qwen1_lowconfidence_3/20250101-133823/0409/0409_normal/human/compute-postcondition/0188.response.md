Postcondition: **`i` and `j` are integers. If `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, the function does not change `i` and `j`. If `marks[i] + shift_x` is out of the range `[0, l]`, both `i` and `j` are incremented by 1.**
