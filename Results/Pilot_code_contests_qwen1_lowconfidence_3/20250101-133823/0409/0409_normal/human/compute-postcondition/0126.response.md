The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `j`, or `magic_tick`. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match-case statement. Since there is no such structure in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are indices; `magic_tick` is equal to `marks[i] + shift_x`**
