The code `print(y)` simply prints the value of `y`. However, there is no assignment or modification to `y` in the given code snippet. Therefore, the value of `y` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` is True, `y_solved` is False, `i` is `n`, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `magic_tick` is None, `y` is its original value**
