The variable `x_solved` is set to `True`, but none of the other variables (`res_x`, `i`, `mark`, `res_y`) are directly affected by this line of code. The values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `i` is 1, `mark` is `marks[0]`, and `res_y` is the minimum of the maximum of 0 and `res_y`, and `n - 1`; `x_solved` is True.**
