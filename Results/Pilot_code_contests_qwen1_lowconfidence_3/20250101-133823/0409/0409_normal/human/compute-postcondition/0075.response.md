The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most nested loop or structure it is inside. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional structure immediately preceding the `break` statement in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not affect any variable values and simply exits the nearest enclosing loop or structure. 

Given the initial state and the fact that no operations are performed on the variables, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`**
