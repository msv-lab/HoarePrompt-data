Output State: **`res_y` is the minimum of the maximum of 0 and `res_y`, and `n - 1`; `i` is 1 (since `i` is 0 before and it is incremented by 1); `mark` is `marks[0]`; `res_y` is the index in `marks` where `mark + y` would be inserted to keep the list sorted.**

Explanation:
- `res_y` is updated using `bisect.bisect_left(marks, mark + y, lo=i)`. Here, `mark` is `marks[0]` because `i` is 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so now `i` is 1.
- `mark` remains `marks[0]`.
- The value of `res_y` is the index in `marks` where `mark + y` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order, but it also satisfies the condition of being the minimum of the maximum of 0 and `res_y`, and `n - 1`.
