Output State: **either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is true, `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` and `marks[i] + shift_x == marks[j] + shift_y`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to run until either `i` or `j` reaches `n`.
- During each iteration, the loop compares `marks[i] + shift_x` with `marks[j] + shift_y` and adjusts `i` and `j` accordingly.
- If `marks[i] + shift_x` equals `marks[j] + shift_y` and falls within the valid range `[0, l]`, `magic_tick` is updated to this value.
- The loop terminates when either `i` or `j` exceeds `n-1`.

Thus, after the loop has executed, `i` and `j` will be such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n` holds true. If `magic_tick` has been set during the loop, it will hold the value of `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` and `marks[i] + shift_x == marks[j] + shift_y`. Otherwise, `magic_tick` will remain undefined.
