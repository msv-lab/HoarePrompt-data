`res_y` is assigned the value of `bisect.bisect_left(marks, mark + y, lo=i)`. This function returns the index where `mark + y` should be inserted in order to keep `marks` sorted, and the comparison starts from index `i`. Since `i` is 2, the search starts from index 2.

Given the initial state:
- `res_x` is within the range [0, n-1]
- `i` is 2
- `mark` is `marks[1]`
- `res_y` is the minimum of the maximum of 0 and `res_y`, and `n - 1`

After executing the code, `res_y` will be updated based on the bisect_left operation. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
**`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `i` is 2, `mark` is `marks[1]`, `res_y` is the minimum of the maximum of 0 and the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(marks, mark + y, lo=i)`, and `y_solved` remains as per the precondition.**
