The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 0, so the new value of `i` is 1. The values of `j`, `marks[i] + shift_x`, and `marks[j] + shift_y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the current value of `(marks[i] + shift_x)` is less than the current value of `(marks[j] + shift_y)`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the current value of `(marks[i] + shift_x)` is less than the current value of `(marks[j] + shift_y)`**
