Postcondition: ***`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `i` is 2, `mark` is `marks[1]`, `res_y` is the minimum of the maximum of 0 and the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(marks, mark + y, lo=i)`, `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `y_solved` is `True`, and `x_solved` remains unchanged. If `marks[res_y] == mark + y`, then `y_solved` is `True` and `x_solved` remains unchanged; otherwise, the state of `y_solved` remains unchanged.***
