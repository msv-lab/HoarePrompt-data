Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are indices, `shift_x` and `shift_y` are constants, and `marks` is an array. If `marks[i] + shift_x` is greater than `marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 1. Otherwise, if `marks[i] + shift_x` is less than `marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is 0. If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, then `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `magic_tick` is equal to `marks[i] + shift_x`. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, and either `marks[i] + shift_x < 0` or `marks[i] + shift_x > l` is true.***
