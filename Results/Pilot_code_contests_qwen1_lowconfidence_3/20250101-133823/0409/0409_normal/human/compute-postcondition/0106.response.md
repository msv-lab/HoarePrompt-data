`j` is incremented by 1, which means `j += 1`. Initially, `j` was 0, so after executing this line, `j` becomes 1. The other variables (`i` and the condition involving `marks[i] + shift_x` and `marks[j] + shift_y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `marks[i] + shift_x` is greater than `marks[j] + shift_y`.**
