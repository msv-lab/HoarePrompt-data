The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but rather breaks out of the loop or conditional block. Given the initial state, the conditions `i >= n` or `j >= n` are true, and `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[0] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[0] + shift_x <= l`. The `break` statement will exit the current loop or conditional block without changing any of the variable values.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is still true, `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[0] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[0] + shift_x <= l`. We break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.**
