The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or conditional block it is inside. In this case, since the condition `i >= n` or `j >= n` is already met in the initial state, the `break` statement will simply cause the program to exit the loop or conditional block without changing the values of `i` or `j`. Therefore, the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0**
