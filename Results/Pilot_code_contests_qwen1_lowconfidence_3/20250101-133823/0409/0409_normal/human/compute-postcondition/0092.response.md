The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a nested structure but does not change the values of variables outside of that context. In this case, the `break` statement is not inside any loop or nested structure, so it simply exits the implied context without changing any variable values. The conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`res_x` and `res_y` are within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False`, `i` is either `n+1` or remains `i` (initially greater than or equal to `n`), `j` is either `n` or remains `j` (initially greater than or equal to `n`), `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`, `magic_tick` is `marks[i] + shift_x`, and the condition `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y` still holds.**
