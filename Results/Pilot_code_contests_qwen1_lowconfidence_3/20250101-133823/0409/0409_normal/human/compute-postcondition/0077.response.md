The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The conditions `i >= n` and `j >= n` still evaluate to true, so the if part of the code does not change any variables. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, `j` is greater than or equal to `n+1`, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`.**
