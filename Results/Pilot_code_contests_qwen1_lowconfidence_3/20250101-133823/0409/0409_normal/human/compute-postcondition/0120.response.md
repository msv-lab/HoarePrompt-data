To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the `while True` loop continues.

Given the loop condition `while True:` indicates that the loop will always continue unless explicitly broken. Therefore, no changes to the program state are required to ensure the loop executes another iteration. The state from the end of the previous iteration should remain unchanged.

However, for clarity and completeness, let's list the current state:

- `i` and `j` are indices.
- `shift_x` and `shift_y` are constants.
- `marks` is an array.

The specific conditions given are:
- If `marks[i] + shift_x` is greater than `marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 1.
- If `marks[i] + shift_x` is less than `marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is 0.
- If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, then `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `magic_tick` is equal to `marks[i] + shift_x`.
- Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, and either `marks[i] + shift_x < 0` or `marks[i] + shift_x > l` is true.

Since the loop is `while True`, it will always continue executing as long as the loop is not manually broken. Therefore, no modifications to the state are needed.

**State:**
**`i` and `j` are indices, `shift_x` and `shift_y` are constants, and `marks` is an array.**
