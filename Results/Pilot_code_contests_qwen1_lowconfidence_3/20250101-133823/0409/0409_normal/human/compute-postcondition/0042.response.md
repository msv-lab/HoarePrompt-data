Postcondition: ***`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` and `y_solved` are both True, `i` is `n`, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `magic_tick` is None***

This postcondition includes all the information from the precondition and adds the condition that both `x_solved` and `y_solved` are True, as specified by the if condition.
