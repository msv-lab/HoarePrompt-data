The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `i` remains unknown because the initial value of `i` was not specified. However, since the initial state mentions that `i` is an integer and the condition for `j` (if either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`) does not change `i` or `j`, `j` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is an integer increased by 1, `j` is an integer.

Output State: **`i` is an integer increased by 1, `j` is an integer**
