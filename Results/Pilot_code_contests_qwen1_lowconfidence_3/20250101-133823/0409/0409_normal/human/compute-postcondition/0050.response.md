The code `print(1)` does not affect any variables or their states; it simply prints the number 1. Therefore, the only change is that the number 1 is printed. All other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` is True, `y_solved` is False, `i` is `n`, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `magic_tick` is None, print output is 1**
