The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a nested structure like an `if` statement. In this case, since there is no loop or nested structure context provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the variables `i`, `j`, and `magic_tick` remain unchanged. The `break` statement does not alter the values of these variables.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are integers; `magic_tick` is equal to `marks[i] + shift_x`.**
