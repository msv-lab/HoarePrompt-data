`j` is incremented by 1, which means its value is now one more than its previous value. The value of `i` remains the same as before, and we may still break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `i >= n` or `j >= n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1, and we may break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `i >= n` or `j >= n`.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1, and we may break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `i >= n` or `j >= n.`**
