`magic_tick` is assigned the value of `marks[i] + shift_x`. The values of `i` and `j` are not affected by this operation, and the condition that either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n` will determine whether a break occurs, but the break itself does not change the values of `i` and `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` and `j` are integers; `magic_tick` is equal to `marks[i] + shift_x`.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are integers; `magic_tick` is equal to `marks[i] + shift_x`**
