Postcondition: ***`res_x` and `res_y` are within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` and `y_solved` are boolean flags indicating whether `x` and `y` have been solved, `i` and `j` are indices, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `magic_tick` is either set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` or remains `None`. If a valid `magic_tick` is found, `1` is printed to the console. Otherwise, the values of `x` and `y` are printed to the console.***

**Explanation:**
- The if condition is always false (`not x_solved and x_solved` evaluates to false because `x_solved` cannot be both False and True simultaneously).
- Therefore, the else part of the if-else block is executed.
- In the else part, the overall postcondition includes the constraints on `res_x` and `res_y`, the status of `x_solved` and `y_solved`, the indices `i` and `j`, the value of `mark`, and the possible assignment of `magic_tick`.
- If a valid `magic_tick` is found, `1` is printed. Otherwise, the values of `x` and `y` (which are `res_x` and `res_y`) are printed.
