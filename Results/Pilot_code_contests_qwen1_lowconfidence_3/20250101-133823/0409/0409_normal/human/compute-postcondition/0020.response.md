The code `break` does not change any variable values but indicates the exit from the current loop or conditional block. The states of `res_y`, `i`, and `mark` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res_y` is the minimum of the maximum of 0 and `res_y`, and `n - 1`; `i` is 0 (or previous_i + 1); `mark` is `marks[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
