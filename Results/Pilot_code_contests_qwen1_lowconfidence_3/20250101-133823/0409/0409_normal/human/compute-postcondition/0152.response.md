The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The initial values of `i` and `magic_tick` remain unchanged. The conditions `i >= n` or `j >= n` still hold true. The inequality `marks[0] + shift_x > marks[0] + shift_y` also remains valid.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[0] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[0] + shift_x <= l`, either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is still true, and `marks[0] + shift_x > marks[0] + shift_y`**
