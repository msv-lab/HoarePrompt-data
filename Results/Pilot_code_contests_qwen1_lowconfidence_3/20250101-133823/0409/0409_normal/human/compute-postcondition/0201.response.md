Postcondition: **`res_x` and `res_y` are within the range [0, n-1]. `x_solved` and `y_solved` are boolean flags indicating whether `x` and `y` have been solved. `i` is `n`, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, and `magic_tick` is either set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` or remains `None`. If a valid `magic_tick` is found, `1` is printed to the console. Otherwise, the values of `x` and `y` are printed to the console. If `x_solved` and `y_solved` are both True, the print statement outputs `0`.**
