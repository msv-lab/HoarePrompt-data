`i` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` remains unchanged, and the condition that either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n` might or might not be true after the increment. However, since no loop or if statement is explicitly mentioned to be broken, the condition itself does not change.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `j` is the same as before, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n` is the same as before.**
