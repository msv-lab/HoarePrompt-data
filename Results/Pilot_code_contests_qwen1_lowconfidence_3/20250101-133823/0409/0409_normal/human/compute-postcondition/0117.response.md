Postcondition: **`i` and `j` are indices, and `shift_x` and `shift_y` are constants. If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, then `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `magic_tick` is equal to `marks[i] + shift_x`, and `(marks[i] + shift_x >= marks[j] + shift_y)` is true. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `(marks[i] + shift_x < 0 or marks[i] + shift_x > l)` is true.**
