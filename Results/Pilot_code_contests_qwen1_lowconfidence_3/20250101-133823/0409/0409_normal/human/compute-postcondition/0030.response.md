According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `mark`. At the end of the previous iteration, we have the following states:
- `res_x` is within the range [0, n-1]
- `i` is 1
- `mark` is `marks[0]`
- `res_y` is the minimum of the maximum of 0 and `res_y`, and `n - 1`
- If `marks[res_y] == mark + y`, then both `x_solved` and `y_solved` are True. Otherwise, the values of `res_x`, `i`, `mark`, `res_y`, and `y_solved` remain as per the precondition.

For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes `i = 2`. The variable `mark` will now be the value of `marks[1]`.

The other variables (`res_x`, `res_y`, and `y_solved`) remain unchanged because they were only updated under specific conditions that did not occur during the previous iteration.

State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `i` is 2, `mark` is `marks[1]`, and `res_y` is the minimum of the maximum of 0 and `res_y`, and `n - 1`. If `marks[res_y] == mark + y`, then both `x_solved` and `y_solved` are True. Otherwise, the values of `res_x`, `i`, `mark`, `res_y`, and `y_solved` remain as per the precondition.**
