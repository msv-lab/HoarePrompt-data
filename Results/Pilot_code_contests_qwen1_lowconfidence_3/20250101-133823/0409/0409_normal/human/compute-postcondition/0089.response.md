The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Based on the initial state, `j` was either `n` or initially greater than or equal to `n`. After executing the code, the value of `j` will be updated to `j + 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `res_x` and `res_y` are within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False`, `i` is either `n+1` or remains `i` (initially greater than or equal to `n`), `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`, and the condition `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y` still holds.

Output State: **`res_x` and `res_y` are within the range [0, n-1]; `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False`; `i` is either `n+1` or remains `i` (initially greater than or equal to `n`); `j` is `j + 1`; `mark` is `marks[n-1]`; `x` is `res_x`; `y` is `res_y`; the condition `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y` still holds.**
