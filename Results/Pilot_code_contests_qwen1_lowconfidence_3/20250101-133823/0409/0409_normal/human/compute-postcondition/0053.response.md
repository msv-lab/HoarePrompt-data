Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over the tuple pairs `[(x, y), (-x, y), (x, -y), (x, y)]`.
   - Each pair `(shift_x, shift_y)` is assigned to `(x, y)` within the loop.
   - The loop will execute if the tuple pairs are valid and can be assigned to `(x, y)`.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `res_x` is within the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - `res_y` is within the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - `x_solved` is `False`.
   - `y_solved` is `False`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `mark` is `marks[n-1]`.
   - `magic_tick` is `None`.

3. **Loop Execution Requirements:**
   - For each iteration, `(x, y)` will take one of the values from the tuple pairs.
   - The initial values of `x` and `y` need to be defined or assigned before the loop starts.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop will assign each value of the tuple pairs to `(x, y)`, we need to ensure that `x` and `y` are correctly initialized or set before the loop starts.
   - The initial values of `x` and `y` should be such that they cover all possible values in the tuples `(x, y), (-x, y), (x, -y), (x, y)`.

Given the initial conditions, we need to ensure that `x` and `y` are properly set. Since `res_x` and `res_y` are already within the required ranges, we can use them directly. However, since `x` and `y` are not explicitly mentioned, we assume they are derived from `res_x` and `res_y`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `x` and `y` are correctly set.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` is False, `y_solved` is False, `i` is `n`, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `magic_tick` is `None`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`**
