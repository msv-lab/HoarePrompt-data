`j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 0, so now `j` is 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 1, either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is still true, `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[0] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[0] + shift_x <= l`, and the condition `(0 <= marks[i] + shift_x > l)` is true.
