`marks` is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function over the next line of input split into individual integers. The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are unchanged. The precondition that `n` values are read and converted to integers is now part of the state.

Output State: **`n` is assigned values read from input, `l` is assigned values read from input, `x` is assigned values read from input, `y` is assigned values read from input, `marks` is a map object of integers read from the next line of input split and converted to integers, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l.**
