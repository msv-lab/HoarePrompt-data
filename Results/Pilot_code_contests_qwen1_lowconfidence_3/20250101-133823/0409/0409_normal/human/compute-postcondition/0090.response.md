The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given that `i` was initially either `n+1` or greater than or equal to `n`, after the increment, `i` will be one more than its initial value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the provided initial state.

Output State: **`res_x` and `res_y` are within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False`, `i` is either `n+2` or one more than its initial value (which was >= `n`), `j` is either `n` or remains `j` (initially >= `n`), `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`, and the condition `marks[i-1] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y` still holds.**
