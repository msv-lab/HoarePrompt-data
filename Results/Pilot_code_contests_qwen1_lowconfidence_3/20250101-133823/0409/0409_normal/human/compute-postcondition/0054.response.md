The code initializes two variables `i` and `j` to 0. This affects the values of `i` and `j` but does not change the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], `res_y` is within the range [0, n-1], `x_solved` is False, `y_solved` is False, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `mark` is `marks[n-1]`, `magic_tick` is `None`, `x` is `res_x`, `y` is `res_y`**
