You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a1 = 0, an = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, aj - ai = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.

Input

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 2 ≤ l ≤ 109, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 = a1 < a2 < ... < an = l), where ai shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.

Output

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p1, p2, ..., pv (0 ≤ pi ≤ l). Number pi means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of pi centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Examples

Input

3 250 185 230
0 185 250


Output

1
230


Input

4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250


Output

0


Input

2 300 185 230
0 300


Output

2
185 230

Note

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

                #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step and consider the possible outcomes based on the loop structure and the provided output states for the first few iterations.
                #
                #### Loop Analysis
                #
                #1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `shift_x`, `shift_y` being set to `(res_x, res_y)`, `(-res_x, res_y)`, `(res_x, -res_y)`, or `(res_x, res_y)` respectively. This means `i` and `j` are reset to 0 for each iteration.
                #
                #2. **Inner Loop Execution**:
                #   - The inner `while` loop runs as long as both `i` and `j` are less than `n`.
                #   - The conditions inside the `while` loop involve comparing `marks[i] + shift_x` and `marks[j] + shift_y`.
                #   - If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, `j` is incremented.
                #   - If `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, `i` is incremented.
                #   - If `marks[i] + shift_x == marks[j] + shift_y` and `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, `magic_tick` is set to this value and the loop breaks.
                #   - Otherwise, both `i` and `j` are incremented.
                #
                #3. **Outer Loop Execution**:
                #   - The outer loop runs through all four combinations of `shift_x` and `shift_y`.
                #
                #### Considering the Provided Output States
                #
                #- After the first iteration of the outer loop:
                #  - `res_x` and `res_y` are within the range `[0, n-1]`.
                #  - `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False`.
                #  - Either `i` and `j` are `n` or one of them is `n`.
                #  - `mark` is `marks[n-1]`.
                #  - `x` is `res_x` and `y` is `res_y`.
                #  - `magic_tick` is either set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` or `None`.
                #
                #- After the second iteration of the outer loop:
                #  - `i` and `j` are indices such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n`.
                #  - `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`.
                #
                #- After the third iteration of the outer loop:
                #  - Either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is true.
                #  - `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` and `marks[i] + shift_x == marks[j] + shift_y`.
                #
                #### Final Output State
                #
                #From the above analysis, we can deduce the following:
                #
                #- If the loop completes all its iterations, it will have checked all possible shifts `(res_x, res_y)`, `(-res_x, res_y)`, `(res_x, -res_y)`, and `(res_x, res_y)`.
                #- If `magic_tick` is set during any of these iterations, it means a valid `magic_tick` was found.
                #- If no valid `magic_tick` is found after all iterations, `magic_tick` will remain `None`.
                #
                #Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, we can conclude:
                #
                #**Output State:**
                #- `res_x` and `res_y` are within the range `[0, n-1]`.
                #- `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False` until a valid solution is found.
                #- `i` and `j` are indices such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is true.
                #- `mark` is `marks[n-1]`.
                #- `x` is `res_x` and `y` is `res_y`.
                #- `magic_tick` is either set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` or `None` if no such value is found.
                #
                #This covers the state of all variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.

                    print(1)
                    print(magic_tick)

If a valid `magic_tick` is found, `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` and `1` is printed to the console.

If a valid `magic_tick` is found, `1` is printed to the console. Otherwise, the values of `x` and `y` are printed to the console. If `x_solved` is True and `y_solved` is False, `y` retains its original value.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
