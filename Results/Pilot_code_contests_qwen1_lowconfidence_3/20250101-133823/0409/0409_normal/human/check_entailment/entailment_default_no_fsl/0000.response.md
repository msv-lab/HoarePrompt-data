Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code fails to properly check for the existence of marks that can measure both \(x\) and \(y\) distances when the input sequence is not strictly increasing. Hereâ€™s an example that highlights this issue:

Consider the input:
```
3 250 185 230
0 185 250
```

In this case, the input sequence `[0, 185, 250]` is strictly increasing, and the code correctly identifies that adding a mark at `230` would allow measuring `230`. However, if the sequence were not strictly increasing, for instance:
```
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250
```

Here, the sequence is not strictly increasing because `20` comes before `185`. The code does not account for this scenario, leading to potential incorrect results. Since the code does not handle this edge case, it does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
