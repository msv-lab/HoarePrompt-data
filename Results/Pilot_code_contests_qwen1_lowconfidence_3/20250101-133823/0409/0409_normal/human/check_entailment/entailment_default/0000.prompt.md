You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

Output hints: The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation:The code originally looks correct. The function hints agree with the code and with their help we determine that the code indeed follows the problem description. the function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints: The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect and not follow the problem description. We also see that the output hints agree with the code and they also help prove that the code is incorrect.  The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Output hints: The function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. If the taget is at the last index it wont be found as the loop will break before reaching the last index.

Example answer 3:
Explanation: Originnaly the code looks correct but after confirming that the output hints agree with the code,we can see the function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the list. However, the termination condition of the while loop is `left < right`, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely when `left` is equal to `right`. This condition can lead to missing the target element if it is at the last index of the list. Also when left and right are adjacent then mid will always be left leading to infinate loop.
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a1 = 0, an = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, aj - ai = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.

Input

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 2 ≤ l ≤ 109, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 = a1 < a2 < ... < an = l), where ai shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.

Output

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p1, p2, ..., pv (0 ≤ pi ≤ l). Number pi means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of pi centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Examples

Input

3 250 185 230
0 185 250


Output

1
230


Input

4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250


Output

0


Input

2 300 185 230
0 300


Output

2
185 230

Note

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.

def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, sys.stdin.next().split())
    marks = map(int, sys.stdin.next().split())
    x_solved = False
    y_solved = False

            while True:
                if i >= n or j >= n:
                    break
                if marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y:
                    j += 1
                elif marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y:
                    i += 1
                elif 0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l:
                    magic_tick = marks[i] + shift_x
                    break
                else:
                    i += 1
                    j += 1

```
Output hints: Functionality: The function processes a sequence of integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(0 = a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n = l\). It checks for the existence of elements in the sequence such that the sum of an element and a given value \(x\) or \(y\) lies within the bounds \([0, l]\). The function then determines and prints the appropriate output based on the following criteria:

1. If both \(x\) and \(y\) can be found in the sequence such that \(a_{res_x} + x\) and \(a_{res_y} + y\) lie within the bounds, the function prints `0`.
2. If only \(x\) can be found, the function prints `1` followed by the value of \(y\).
3. If only \(y\) can be found, the function prints `1` followed by the value of \(x\).
4. If neither \(x\) nor \(y\) can be found, the function checks for the smallest integer \(magic\_tick\) in the sequence such that \(a_i + x\) or \(a_j + y\) equals \(magic\_tick\) and \(0 \leq magic\_tick \leq l\). If such an integer is found, it prints `1` followed by \(magic\_tick\); otherwise, it prints `2` followed by the original values of \(x\) and \(y\).

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that the input sequence is strictly increasing, but the code does not explicitly check for this condition.
- The function does not handle cases where the input sequence is not strictly increasing, which could lead to incorrect results.
- The function uses `map(int, sys.stdin.next().split())` to read input, which may raise exceptions if the input format is incorrect or incomplete.
- The function does not validate the ranges for \(n\), \(l\), \(x\), and \(y\), which could lead to runtime errors if the values are out of the specified bounds.

Final state after the function concludes:
- The function sets several boolean flags (`x_solved`, `y_solved`) and computes indices (`res_x`, `res_y`) to indicate whether certain values can be found in the sequence.
- Depending on the conditions met, the function prints one of the following outputs:
  - `0`: Both \(x\) and \(y\) are found.
  - `1 <value>`: Only one of \(x\) or \(y\) is found, where `<value>` is the other value.
  - `1 <magic_tick>`: A valid `magic_tick` is found.
  - `2 <x> <y>`: Neither \(x\) nor \(y\) can be found, and `magic_tick` is not set.

The function ensures that all necessary conditions are checked and prints the appropriate output based on the findings.

Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
