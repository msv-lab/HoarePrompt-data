You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a1 = 0, an = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, aj - ai = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.

Input

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 2 ≤ l ≤ 109, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 = a1 < a2 < ... < an = l), where ai shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.

Output

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p1, p2, ..., pv (0 ≤ pi ≤ l). Number pi means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of pi centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Examples

Input

3 250 185 230
0 185 250


Output

1
230


Input

4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250


Output

0


Input

2 300 185 230
0 300


Output

2
185 230

Note

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to correctly identify and add the necessary marks when the initial marks do not allow measuring both `x` and `y` distances directly or indirectly.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
3 250 185 230
0 200 250
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
230
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0
```

In this case, the initial marks are at 0 and 200, and the length of the ruler is 250. Neither `x=185` nor `y=230` can be measured directly or indirectly using these marks. However, the program incorrectly outputs `0`, indicating that no additional marks are needed, which is not correct.

The program checks for the presence of `x` and `y` in the existing marks but does not account for the scenario where neither `x` nor `y` can be derived from the existing marks through addition or subtraction. It also does not correctly handle the logic for finding a common mark that can satisfy both `x` and `y`.

To fix this, the program needs to properly handle scenarios where neither `x` nor `y` can be derived directly or indirectly from the existing marks.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Functionality: The function processes a sequence of integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(0 = a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n = l\). It checks for the existence of elements in the sequence such that the sum of an element and a given value \(x\) or \(y\) lies within the bounds \([0, l]\). The function then determines and prints the appropriate output based on the following criteria:

1. If both \(x\) and \(y\) can be found in the sequence such that \(a_{res_x} + x\) and \(a_{res_y} + y\) lie within the bounds, the function prints `0`.
2. If only \(x\) can be found, the function prints `1` followed by the value of \(y\).
3. If only \(y\) can be found, the function prints `1` followed by the value of \(x\).
4. If neither \(x\) nor \(y\) can be found, the function checks for the smallest integer \(magic\_tick\) in the sequence such that \(a_i + x\) or \(a_j + y\) equals \(magic\_tick\) and \(0 \leq magic\_tick \leq l\). If such an integer is found, it prints `1` followed by \(magic\_tick\); otherwise, it prints `2` followed by the original values of \(x\) and \(y\).

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that the input sequence is strictly increasing, but the code does not explicitly check for this condition.
- The function does not handle cases where the input sequence is not strictly increasing, which could lead to incorrect results.
- The function uses `map(int, sys.stdin.next().split())` to read input, which may raise exceptions if the input format is incorrect or incomplete.
- The function does not validate the ranges for \(n\), \(l\), \(x\), and \(y\), which could lead to runtime errors if the values are out of the specified bounds.

Final state after the function concludes:
- The function sets several boolean flags (`x_solved`, `y_solved`) and computes indices (`res_x`, `res_y`) to indicate whether certain values can be found in the sequence.
- Depending on the conditions met, the function prints one of the following outputs:
  - `0`: Both \(x\) and \(y\) are found.
  - `1 <value>`: Only one of \(x\) or \(y\) is found, where `<value>` is the other value.
  - `1 <magic_tick>`: A valid `magic_tick` is found.
  - `2 <x> <y>`: Neither \(x\) nor \(y\) can be found, and `magic_tick` is not set.

The function ensures that all necessary conditions are checked and prints the appropriate output based on the findings.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
