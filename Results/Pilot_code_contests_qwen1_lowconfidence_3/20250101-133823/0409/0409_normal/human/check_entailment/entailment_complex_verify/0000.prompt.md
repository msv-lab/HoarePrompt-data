You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a1 = 0, an = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, aj - ai = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.

Input

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 2 ≤ l ≤ 109, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 = a1 < a2 < ... < an = l), where ai shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.

Output

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p1, p2, ..., pv (0 ≤ pi ≤ l). Number pi means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of pi centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Examples

Input

3 250 185 230
0 185 250


Output

1
230


Input

4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250


Output

0


Input

2 300 185 230
0 300


Output

2
185 230

Note

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure both distances \(x\) and \(y\) is flawed.

One critical issue is in the handling of the `bisect_left` function. The program attempts to find indices where the sum of the current mark and either \(x\) or \(y\) can be found in the existing marks. However, this approach does not guarantee finding the exact positions needed to measure both distances.

Consider the following input:

```
3 250 185 230
0 185 250
```

- The program should output `1 230` because adding a mark at 230 cm would allow measuring both 185 cm and 230 cm.
- However, the current implementation may fail to correctly identify this solution.

To illustrate, let's walk through the logic step-by-step for the given input:

1. The program iterates over each mark and checks if \(mark + x\) or \(mark + y\) exists in the remaining marks.
2. For the mark at 185 cm:
   - It checks if 185 + 185 (370) or 185 + 230 (415) exists in the list. Neither exist.
3. For the mark at 250 cm:
   - It checks if 250 + 185 (435) or 250 + 230 (480) exists in the list. Neither exist.
4. Since it fails to find a solution, it enters the loop to find a magic tick manually but incorrectly.

The program should handle cases where the direct check using `bisect_left` might not yield the correct result. A more robust approach would involve explicitly checking all possible combinations of marks and their offsets to ensure both distances can be measured.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and hence is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

                #
                #### Loop Analysis
                #
                #1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `shift_x`, `shift_y` being set to `(res_x, res_y)`, `(-res_x, res_y)`, `(res_x, -res_y)`, or `(res_x, res_y)` respectively. This means `i` and `j` are reset to 0 for each iteration.
                #
                #2. **Inner Loop Execution**:
                #   - The inner `while` loop runs as long as both `i` and `j` are less than `n`.
                #   - The conditions inside the `while` loop involve comparing `marks[i] + shift_x` and `marks[j] + shift_y`.
                #   - If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, `j` is incremented.
                #   - If `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, `i` is incremented.
                #   - If `marks[i] + shift_x == marks[j] + shift_y` and `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, `magic_tick` is set to this value and the loop breaks.
                #   - Otherwise, both `i` and `j` are incremented.
                #
                #3. **Outer Loop Execution**:
                #   - The outer loop runs through all four combinations of `shift_x` and `shift_y`.
                #
                #### Considering the Provided Output States
                #
                #- After the first iteration of the outer loop:
                #  - `res_x` and `res_y` are within the range `[0, n-1]`.
                #  - `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False`.
                #  - Either `i` and `j` are `n` or one of them is `n`.
                #  - `mark` is `marks[n-1]`.
                #  - `x` is `res_x` and `y` is `res_y`.
                #  - `magic_tick` is either set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` or `None`.
                #
                #- After the second iteration of the outer loop:
                #  - `i` and `j` are indices such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n`.
                #  - `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`.
                #
                #- After the third iteration of the outer loop:
                #  - Either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is true.
                #  - `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` and `marks[i] + shift_x == marks[j] + shift_y`.
                #
                #### Final Output State
                #
                #From the above analysis, we can deduce the following:
                #
                #- If the loop completes all its iterations, it will have checked all possible shifts `(res_x, res_y)`, `(-res_x, res_y)`, `(res_x, -res_y)`, and `(res_x, res_y)`.
                #- If `magic_tick` is set during any of these iterations, it means a valid `magic_tick` was found.
                #- If no valid `magic_tick` is found after all iterations, `magic_tick` will remain `None`.
                #
                #Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, we can conclude:
                #
                #**Output State:**
                #- `res_x` and `res_y` are within the range `[0, n-1]`.
                #- `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False` until a valid solution is found.
                #- `i` and `j` are indices such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is true.
                #- `mark` is `marks[n-1]`.
                #- `x` is `res_x` and `y` is `res_y`.
                #- `magic_tick` is either set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` or `None` if no such value is found.
                #
                #This covers the state of all variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function processes a sequence of integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(0 = a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n = l\). It checks for the existence of elements in the sequence such that the sum of an element and a given value \(x\) or \(y\) lies within the bounds \([0, l]\). The function then determines and prints the appropriate output based on the following criteria:

1. If both \(x\) and \(y\) can be found in the sequence such that \(a_{res_x} + x\) and \(a_{res_y} + y\) lie within the bounds, the function prints `0`.
2. If only \(x\) can be found, the function prints `1` followed by the value of \(y\).
3. If only \(y\) can be found, the function prints `1` followed by the value of \(x\).
4. If neither \(x\) nor \(y\) can be found, the function checks for the smallest integer \(magic\_tick\) in the sequence such that \(a_i + x\) or \(a_j + y\) equals \(magic\_tick\) and \(0 \leq magic\_tick \leq l\). If such an integer is found, it prints `1` followed by \(magic\_tick\); otherwise, it prints `2` followed by the original values of \(x\) and \(y\).

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that the input sequence is strictly increasing, but the code does not explicitly check for this condition.
- The function does not handle cases where the input sequence is not strictly increasing, which could lead to incorrect results.
- The function uses `map(int, sys.stdin.next().split())` to read input, which may raise exceptions if the input format is incorrect or incomplete.
- The function does not validate the ranges for \(n\), \(l\), \(x\), and \(y\), which could lead to runtime errors if the values are out of the specified bounds.

Final state after the function concludes:
- The function sets several boolean flags (`x_solved`, `y_solved`) and computes indices (`res_x`, `res_y`) to indicate whether certain values can be found in the sequence.
- Depending on the conditions met, the function prints one of the following outputs:
  - `0`: Both \(x\) and \(y\) are found.
  - `1 <value>`: Only one of \(x\) or \(y\) is found, where `<value>` is the other value.
  - `1 <magic_tick>`: A valid `magic_tick` is found.
  - `2 <x> <y>`: Neither \(x\) nor \(y\) can be found, and `magic_tick` is not set.

The function ensures that all necessary conditions are checked and prints the appropriate output based on the findings.
