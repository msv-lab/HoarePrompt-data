Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the logic for determining the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure both distances \(x\) and \(y\) is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, especially when the direct check using `bisect_left` might not yield the correct result. The loop to find a magic tick also does not cover all necessary conditions to ensure both distances can be measured. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
