                #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step and consider the possible outcomes based on the loop structure and the provided output states for the first few iterations.
                #
                #### Loop Analysis
                #
                #1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `shift_x`, `shift_y` being set to `(res_x, res_y)`, `(-res_x, res_y)`, `(res_x, -res_y)`, or `(res_x, res_y)` respectively. This means `i` and `j` are reset to 0 for each iteration.
                #
                #2. **Inner Loop Execution**:
                #   - The inner `while` loop runs as long as both `i` and `j` are less than `n`.
                #   - The conditions inside the `while` loop involve comparing `marks[i] + shift_x` and `marks[j] + shift_y`.
                #   - If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, `j` is incremented.
                #   - If `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, `i` is incremented.
                #   - If `marks[i] + shift_x == marks[j] + shift_y` and `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, `magic_tick` is set to this value and the loop breaks.
                #   - Otherwise, both `i` and `j` are incremented.
                #
                #3. **Outer Loop Execution**:
                #   - The outer loop runs through all four combinations of `shift_x` and `shift_y`.
                #
                #### Considering the Provided Output States
                #
                #- After the first iteration of the outer loop:
                #  - `res_x` and `res_y` are within the range `[0, n-1]`.
                #  - `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False`.
                #  - Either `i` and `j` are `n` or one of them is `n`.
                #  - `mark` is `marks[n-1]`.
                #  - `x` is `res_x` and `y` is `res_y`.
                #  - `magic_tick` is either set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` or `None`.
                #
                #- After the second iteration of the outer loop:
                #  - `i` and `j` are indices such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n`.
                #  - `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`.
                #
                #- After the third iteration of the outer loop:
                #  - Either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is true.
                #  - `magic_tick` is either undefined or set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` and `marks[i] + shift_x == marks[j] + shift_y`.
                #
                #### Final Output State
                #
                #From the above analysis, we can deduce the following:
                #
                #- If the loop completes all its iterations, it will have checked all possible shifts `(res_x, res_y)`, `(-res_x, res_y)`, `(res_x, -res_y)`, and `(res_x, res_y)`.
                #- If `magic_tick` is set during any of these iterations, it means a valid `magic_tick` was found.
                #- If no valid `magic_tick` is found after all iterations, `magic_tick` will remain `None`.
                #
                #Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, we can conclude:
                #
                #**Output State:**
                #- `res_x` and `res_y` are within the range `[0, n-1]`.
                #- `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `False` until a valid solution is found.
                #- `i` and `j` are indices such that either `i >= n` or `j >= n` is true.
                #- `mark` is `marks[n-1]`.
                #- `x` is `res_x` and `y` is `res_y`.
                #- `magic_tick` is either set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` or `None` if no such value is found.
                #
                #This covers the state of all variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.

                    print(1)
                    print(magic_tick)

If a valid `magic_tick` is found, `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x` where `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` and `1` is printed to the console.

If a valid `magic_tick` is found, `1` is printed to the console. Otherwise, the values of `x` and `y` are printed to the console. If `x_solved` is True and `y_solved` is False, `y` retains its original value.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function processes a sequence of integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(0 = a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n = l\). It checks for the existence of elements in the sequence such that the sum of an element and a given value \(x\) or \(y\) lies within the bounds \([0, l]\). The function then determines and prints the appropriate output based on the following criteria:

1. If both \(x\) and \(y\) can be found in the sequence such that \(a_{res_x} + x\) and \(a_{res_y} + y\) lie within the bounds, the function prints `0`.
2. If only \(x\) can be found, the function prints `1` followed by the value of \(y\).
3. If only \(y\) can be found, the function prints `1` followed by the value of \(x\).
4. If neither \(x\) nor \(y\) can be found, the function checks for the smallest integer \(magic\_tick\) in the sequence such that \(a_i + x\) or \(a_j + y\) equals \(magic\_tick\) and \(0 \leq magic\_tick \leq l\). If such an integer is found, it prints `1` followed by \(magic\_tick\); otherwise, it prints `2` followed by the original values of \(x\) and \(y\).

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that the input sequence is strictly increasing, but the code does not explicitly check for this condition.
- The function does not handle cases where the input sequence is not strictly increasing, which could lead to incorrect results.
- The function uses `map(int, sys.stdin.next().split())` to read input, which may raise exceptions if the input format is incorrect or incomplete.
- The function does not validate the ranges for \(n\), \(l\), \(x\), and \(y\), which could lead to runtime errors if the values are out of the specified bounds.

Final state after the function concludes:
- The function sets several boolean flags (`x_solved`, `y_solved`) and computes indices (`res_x`, `res_y`) to indicate whether certain values can be found in the sequence.
- Depending on the conditions met, the function prints one of the following outputs:
  - `0`: Both \(x\) and \(y\) are found.
  - `1 <value>`: Only one of \(x\) or \(y\) is found, where `<value>` is the other value.
  - `1 <magic_tick>`: A valid `magic_tick` is found.
  - `2 <x> <y>`: Neither \(x\) nor \(y\) can be found, and `magic_tick` is not set.

The function ensures that all necessary conditions are checked and prints the appropriate output based on the findings.
