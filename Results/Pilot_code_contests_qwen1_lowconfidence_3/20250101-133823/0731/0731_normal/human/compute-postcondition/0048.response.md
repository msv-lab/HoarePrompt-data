Postcondition: ***`H` is as per the precondition, `W` is as per the precondition, `N` is as per the precondition, `sr` is as per the precondition, `sc` is as per the precondition, `S` is as per the precondition, `T` is as per the precondition, `flag` is 1, `i` is N-2, and `AO[2]` is max(1, `AO[2] - 1`), if `T[i]` is 'D'. Otherwise, the variables retain their pre-execution states.***
