`AO[3]` is decremented by 1. The value of `T[i]` remains unchanged if it is not 'U', and `AO[0]` remains unchanged, `AO[1]` remains unchanged, and `AO[3]` remains unchanged, meaning only `AO[3]` is updated. The initial value of `S[i]` is 'D', which remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`H` is as per the precondition, `W` is as per the precondition, `N` is as per the precondition, `sr` is as per the precondition, `sc` is as per the precondition, `S` is as per the precondition, `T` is as per the precondition, `AO[0]` is as per the precondition, `AO[1]` is as per the precondition, `AO[3]` is `AO[3] - 1`, `flag` is as per the precondition, and `S[i]` is 'D'.**
