Postcondition: **`H`, `W`, `N`, `sr`, `sc`, `S`, `T`, `AO`, and `flag` are as per the precondition. If `T[i]` is 'L' and the current value of `i` is equal to `N - 1`, then `AO[0]` is updated to 1, `AO[1]` is updated to `min(W, 2)`, and `AO[3]` remains unchanged. Given that the if condition is `S[i] == 'L'`, the current value of `i` is `N - 1`, and therefore `AO[0]` is updated to 1, `AO[1]` is updated to `min(W, 2)`, and `AO[3]` remains unchanged.**
