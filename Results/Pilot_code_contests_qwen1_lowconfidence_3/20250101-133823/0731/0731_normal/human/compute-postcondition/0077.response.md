`AO[3]` is decremented by 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`H`, `W`, `N`, `sr`, `sc`, `S`, `T`, `flag` are as per the precondition; `i` is 0; `AO[0]` is decreased by 1 but not below 1; `AO[1]` is `min(W, AO[1] + 1)` if `T[0] == 'L'`; `AO[2]` is either decremented by 1 (if it was initially greater than 1) or remains unchanged (if it was 1, 0, or less); `AO[3]` is decreased by 1.**
