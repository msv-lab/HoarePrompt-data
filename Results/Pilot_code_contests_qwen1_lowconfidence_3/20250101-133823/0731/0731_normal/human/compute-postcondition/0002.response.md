The code `S = raw_input()` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `S`. The initial values of `H`, `W`, `N`, `sr`, `sc`, `S`, and `T` are not known, but the type and range constraints for these variables remain unchanged. The variable `S` is now assigned the value of the user's input.

Output State: **`H` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `W` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `N` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `sr` is an integer between 1 and `H`, `sc` is an integer between 1 and `W`, `S` is the input string from the user, `T` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D'.**
