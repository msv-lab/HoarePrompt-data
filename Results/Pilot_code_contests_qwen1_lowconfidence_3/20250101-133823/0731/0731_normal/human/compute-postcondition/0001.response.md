The code `sr, sc = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to `sr` and `sc`. However, since the initial values of `H`, `W`, `N`, `s_r`, `s_c`, `S`, and `T` are not specified, we only know the constraints for these variables.

- `H` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\).
- `W` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\).
- `N` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\).
- `s_r` is an integer between 1 and `H`.
- `s_c` is an integer between 1 and `W`.
- `S` and `T` are strings of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D'.

After executing the code, the values of `s_r` and `s_c` are no longer relevant because they are replaced by `sr` and `sc`. Therefore, the updated variables are `sr` and `sc`.

Output State: **`H` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `W` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `N` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `sr` is an integer between 1 and `H`, `sc` is an integer between 1 and `W`; `S` and `T` are strings of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D'.**
