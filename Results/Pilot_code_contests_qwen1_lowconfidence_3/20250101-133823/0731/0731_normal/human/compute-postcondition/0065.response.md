`AO[1]` is assigned the value of `min(W, AO[1] + 1)`. This means that `AO[1]` will take the minimum value between `W` and `AO[1] + 1`. The other variables are not affected.

Since `AO[1]` is updated based on the values of `W` and `AO[1]`, the updated value of `AO[1]` will be the smaller of these two values. However, without specific values for `W` and `AO[1]`, we can express the new value of `AO[1]` as `min(W, AO[1] + 1)`.

Output State: **`H`, `W`, `N`, `sr`, `sc`, `S`, `T`, `flag` are as per the precondition, `i` is 0, `AO[1]` is `min(W, AO[1] + 1)`.**
