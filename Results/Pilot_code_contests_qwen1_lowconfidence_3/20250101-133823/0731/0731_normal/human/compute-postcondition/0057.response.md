Postcondition: ***`H` is as per the precondition, `W` is as per the precondition, `N` is as per the precondition, `sr` is as per the precondition, `sc` is as per the precondition, `S` is as per the precondition, `T` is as per the precondition, `flag` is 1, `i` is `N-2`. If `S[i] == 'D'`, then `AO[3]` is decremented by 1. In all cases, the variables retain their pre-execution states unless modified by the specific condition in the if part.***
