The code `AO[3] -= 1` decrements the value of `AO[3]` by 1. The value of `AO[3]` was previously determined by one of the conditions in the if statement (either `AO[3] = min(H, AO[3] + 1)` if `T[i]` is 'U', or it was set to some other value initially). Since the exact value of `AO[3]` before this line of code is not specified, we can only say that it has been decreased by 1.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`H` is as per the precondition, `W` is as per the precondition, `N` is as per the precondition, `sr` is as per the precondition, `sc` is as per the precondition, `S` is as per the precondition, `T` is as per the precondition, `flag` is 1, `i` is `N-2`, `AO[3]` is `AO[3] - 1`.**
