Postcondition: **`H` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `W` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `N` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\) and must be greater than or equal to 1, `sr` is an integer between 1 and `H`, `sc` is an integer between 1 and `W`, `S` is the input string from the user, `T` is the string input by the user, `AO` is `[1, W, 1, H]`, `flag` is 0, and the condition `i` is not equal to `N - 1`, if `T[i]` is 'D', the value of `T[i]` remains 'D'. There is no change in other variables as there is no else part in the code.**
