Postcondition: ***`H`, `W`, `N`, `sr`, `sc`, `S`, `T`, `flag`, and `i` remain unchanged. `AO[0]` is decreased by 1 but not below 1. `AO[1]` is `min(W, AO[1] + 1)` if `T[0] == 'L'`. `AO[2]` is either decremented by 1 (if it was initially greater than 1) or remains unchanged (if it was 1, 0, or less). `AO[3]` is decreased by 1 if `S[0] == 'D'`. If `S[0] == 'U'`, `AO[2]` is increased by 1.***

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts while maintaining the integrity of the variables' states as described.
