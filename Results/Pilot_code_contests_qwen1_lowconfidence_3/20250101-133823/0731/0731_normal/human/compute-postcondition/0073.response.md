Postcondition: ***`H`, `W`, `N`, `sr`, `sc`, `S`, `T`, `flag` are as per the precondition. `i` is 0. If `T[0] == 'L'`, then `AO[1]` is `min(W, AO[1] + 1)`. Otherwise, `AO[0]` is decreased by 1 but not below 1. If `T[0] == 'U'`, then `AO[3]` is `min(H, AO[3]_initial + 1)`. Otherwise, `AO[2]` is either decremented by 1 (if it was initially greater than 1) or remains unchanged (if it was 1, 0, or less). `AO[0]`, `AO[1]`, `AO[2]`, `AO[3]` retain their pre-execution states unless modified by the specific condition in the if part.***
