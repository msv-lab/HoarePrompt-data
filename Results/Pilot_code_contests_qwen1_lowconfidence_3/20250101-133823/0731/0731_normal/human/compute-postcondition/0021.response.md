Postcondition: ***`H`, `W`, `N`, `sr`, `sc`, `S`, `T`, `AO`, and `flag` are as per the precondition. If `T[i]` is 'R', `AO[0]` is updated to 1. If `T[i]` is 'U', `AO[3]` is updated to `H`. If `T[i]` is 'D', the value of `T[i]` remains 'D'.***

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes of the if-else block, ensuring that all variables retain their constraints and that the specific updates to `AO` based on the value of `T[i]` are included.
