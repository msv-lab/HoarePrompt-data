Postcondition: ***`H`, `W`, `N`, `sr`, `sc`, `S`, `T`, `flag`, `i`, `AO[0]`, `AO[1]`, `AO[2]`, `AO[3]` are as per the precondition. If `S[i]` is 'L', `AO[1]` is the minimum of `W` and `AO[1] + 1`. If `S[i]` is 'R', `AO[1]` is `AO[1] - 1`. If `S[i]` is 'U', `AO[3]` is `min(H, AO[3] + 1)` and `AO[2]` is increased by 1. If `S[i]` is 'D', `AO[3]` is `AO[3] - 1` and `AO[2]` is at least 1. In all other cases, the variables retain their pre-execution states unless modified by the specific condition in the if part.***
