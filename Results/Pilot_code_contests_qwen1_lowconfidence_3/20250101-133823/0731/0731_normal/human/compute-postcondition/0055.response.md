The code `AO[2] += 1` increments the value of `AO[2]` by 1. Given the initial state, no other variables are affected, and the conditions specified in the if part do not apply since they are only executed based on the value of `T[i]`.

Therefore, the value of `AO[2]` is increased by 1, while all other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`H` is as per the precondition, `W` is as per the precondition, `N` is as per the precondition, `sr` is as per the precondition, `sc` is as per the precondition, `S` is as per the precondition, `T` is as per the precondition, `flag` is 1, `i` is `N-2`, `AO[0]` is at least 1, `AO[1]` is the minimum of `W` and `AO[1] + 1`, `AO[2]` is increased by 1, `AO[3]` is `min(H, AO[3] + 1)`.**
