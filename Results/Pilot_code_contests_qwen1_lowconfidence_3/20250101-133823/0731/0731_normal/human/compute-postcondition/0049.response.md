Postcondition: ***`H` is as per the precondition, `W` is as per the precondition, `N` is as per the precondition, `sr` is as per the precondition, `sc` is as per the precondition, `S` is as per the precondition, `T` is as per the precondition, `flag` is 1, `i` is N-2. If `T[i]` is 'U', `AO[3]` is `min(H, AO[3] + 1)`. Otherwise, if `T[i]` is 'D', `AO[2]` is `max(1, AO[2] - 1)`. In all other cases, the variables retain their pre-execution states.***
