Postcondition: ***`H` is as per the precondition, `W` is as per the precondition, `N` is as per the precondition, `sr` is as per the precondition, `sc` is as per the precondition, `S` is as per the precondition, `T` is as per the precondition, `flag` is either 0 or 1 depending on the condition `(AO[0] > sc or AO[1] < sc or AO[2] > sr or (AO[3] < sr))`, `i` is 0, `AO[0]`, `AO[1]`, `AO[2]`, `AO[3]` are adjusted according to the instructions in the loop based on the characters in `S` and `T`, and the output is 'YES' if `flag` is 0 and 'NO' if `flag` is 1.***
