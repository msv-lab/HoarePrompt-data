The code `AO[1] -= 1` decrements the value of `AO[1]` by 1. The value of `AO[1]` was not specified in the initial state, so it could be any integer. However, since no specific initial value is given, we'll denote it as `val`. After the operation, `AO[1]` will be `val - 1`.

The other variables (`H`, `W`, `N`, `sr`, `sc`, `S`, `T`, `AO`, and `flag`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`H` is as per the precondition, `W` is as per the precondition, `N` is as per the precondition, `sr` is as per the precondition, `sc` is as per the precondition, `S` is as per the precondition, `T` is as per the precondition, `AO` is such that `AO[0]` is as per the precondition and `AO[1]` is `val - 1`, `flag` is as per the precondition.**
