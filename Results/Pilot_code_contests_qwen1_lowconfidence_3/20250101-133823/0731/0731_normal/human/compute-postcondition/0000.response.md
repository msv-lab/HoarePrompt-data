The code `H, W, N = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `H`, `W`, and `N`. The initial conditions specify that `H` and `W` are integers between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `s_r` and `s_c` are integers between 1 and their respective bounds, `N` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), and `S` and `T` are strings of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D'.

After executing the code, the values of `H`, `W`, and `N` are determined by the input, while the values of `s_r`, `s_c`, `S`, and `T` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`H` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `W` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `N` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\); `s_r` is an integer between 1 and `H`, `s_c` is an integer between 1 and `W`; `S` and `T` are strings of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D'.**
