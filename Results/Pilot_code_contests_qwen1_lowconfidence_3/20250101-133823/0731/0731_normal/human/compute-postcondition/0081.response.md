Postcondition: ***`H`, `W`, `N`, `sr`, `sc`, `S`, `T`, `flag`, and `i` retain their pre-execution states unless modified by the specific conditions in the if and else parts. If `S[0] == 'L'`, then `AO[0]` is decreased by 1 but not below 1 and `AO[1]` is `min(W, AO[1] + 1)`. If `S[0] == 'R'`, then `AO[1]` is decreased by 1. If `S[0] == 'U'`, then `AO[2]` is incremented by 1 if it was initially 1 and `AO[3]` is decreased by 1. If `S[0] == 'D'`, then `AO[3]` is decreased by 1. `AO[0]` is increased by 1 if `S[0] == 'L'` and `AO[1]` retains its pre-execution state otherwise.***
