The function `func` accepts no parameters directly listed in the function definition. However, based on the constraints provided, the function seems to operate with internal parameters or inputs that are not explicitly declared within the function signature but are implied by the problem description.

Given the constraints:
- `H` and `W` are integers such that \(2 \leq H, W \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
- `s_r` and `s_c` are integers such that \(1 \leq s_r \leq H\) and \(1 \leq s_c \leq W\)
- `N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
- `S` and `T` are strings consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D' such that \(|S| = |T| = N\)

And the output is not specified in the function signature but rather described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept and process the parameters `H`, `W`, `s_r`, `s_c`, `N`, `S`, and `T` (even though they are not explicitly declared in the function definition).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters H, W, s_r, s_c, N, S, and T, and processes them according to the given constraints.**
