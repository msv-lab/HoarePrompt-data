According to the code, the loop runs in reverse order starting from `N-1` down to `0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 2. 

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The loop starts with `i` set to `N-1` and decrements `i` by 1 each iteration.
2. **Previous Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 from its current value of 1, making `i` equal to 0.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is 0, and the other variables (`H`, `W`, `N`, `sr`, `sc`, `S`, `T`, `flag`, `AO[0]`, `AO[1]`, `AO[2]`, `AO[3]`) retain their pre-execution states unless modified by the specific condition in the if part.

State: **`H`, `W`, `N`, `sr`, `sc`, `S`, `T`, `flag` are as per the precondition, `i` is 0, `AO[0]`, `AO[1]`, `AO[2]`, `AO[3]` retain their pre-execution states unless modified by the specific condition in the if part.**
