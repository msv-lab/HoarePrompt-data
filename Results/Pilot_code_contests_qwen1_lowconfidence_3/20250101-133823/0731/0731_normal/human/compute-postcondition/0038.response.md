Postcondition: **`H` is as per the precondition, `W` is as per the precondition, `N` is as per the precondition, `sr` is as per the precondition, `sc` is as per the precondition, `S` is as per the precondition, `T` is as per the precondition, `flag` is as per the precondition.**

- If `S[i] == 'L'` and `i == N - 1`, then `AO[0]` is incremented by 1, `AO[1]` is set to `min(W, 2)`, and `AO[3]` remains unchanged.
- If `S[i] == 'R'`, then `AO[0]` is set to 1.
- If `S[i] == 'U'`, then `AO[2]` is increased by 1.
- If `S[i] == 'D'`, then `AO[3]` is decreased by 1.
- In all other cases, `AO[0]`, `AO[1]`, `AO[2]`, and `AO[3]` remain unchanged.
