Postcondition: **`H`, `W`, `N`, `sr`, `sc`, `S`, `T`, `AO`, and `flag` are as per the precondition. If `T[i]` is not 'L' and the current value of `i` is equal to `N - 1`, then `AO[0]` remains unchanged, `AO[1]` remains unchanged, and `AO[3]` remains unchanged. If `T[i]` is 'R', `AO[0]` is updated to 1. If `T[i]` is 'U', `AO[3]` is updated to `H`. If `T[i]` is 'D', the value of `T[i]` remains 'D'.**
