Postcondition: ***`H`, `W`, `N`, `sr`, `sc`, `S`, `T`, `flag`, `i`, `AO[0]`, `AO[1]`, `AO[2]`, `AO[3]` are as per the precondition. If `S[i]` is 'R', `AO[1]` is `AO[1] - 1`. If `S[i]` is 'U', `AO[3]` is `min(H, AO[3] + 1)`, `AO[2]` is increased by 1, and `AO[0]` is at least 1. If `S[i]` is 'D', `AO[3]` is decremented by 1 and `AO[2]` is at least 1.***
