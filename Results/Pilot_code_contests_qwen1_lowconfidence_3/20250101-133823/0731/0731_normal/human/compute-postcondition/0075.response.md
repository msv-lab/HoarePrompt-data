`AO[1]` is decreased by 1, so its new value is `AO[1] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`H`, `W`, `N`, `sr`, `sc`, `S`, `T`, `flag` are as per the precondition, `i` is 0, `AO[1]` is `AO[1] - 1`, `AO[0]`, `AO[2]`, `AO[3]` retain their pre-execution states unless modified by the specific condition in the if part.**
