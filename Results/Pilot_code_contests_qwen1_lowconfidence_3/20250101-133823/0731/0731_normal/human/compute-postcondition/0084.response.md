Postcondition: ***`H`, `W`, `N`, `sr`, `sc`, `S`, `T`, `flag`, and `i` retain their pre-execution states unless modified by the specific conditions in the if and else parts. If `AO[0] > AO[1] or AO[2] > AO[3]` is true, then `flag` is set to 1. If this condition is false, no changes occur.***

Explanation:
- If `AO[0] > AO[1] or AO[2] > AO[3]` is true, the postcondition includes setting `flag` to 1.
- If the condition is false, no changes are made to the variables mentioned, and `flag` remains unchanged from its pre-execution state.
