Postcondition: ***`H`, `W`, `N`, `sr`, `sc`, `S`, `T`, `flag` are as per the precondition. `i` is 1. `AO[0]`, `AO[1]`, `AO[2]`, `AO[3]` retain their pre-execution states unless modified by the specific condition in the if part. If `AO[0] > AO[1]` or `AO[2] > AO[3]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
