The code `AO[1] -= 1` decrements the value of `AO[1]` by 1. Since no specific values were given for the initial state of `AO[1]`, we can only say that `AO[1]` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged as per the precondition.

Output State: **`H` is as per the precondition, `W` is as per the precondition, `N` is as per the precondition, `sr` is as per the precondition, `sc` is as per the precondition, `S` is as per the precondition, `T` is as per the precondition, `flag` is 1, `i` is `N-2`, `AO[1]` is `AO[1] - 1`.**
