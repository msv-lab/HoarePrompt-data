Postcondition: ***`H` is as per the precondition, `W` is as per the precondition, `N` is as per the precondition, `sr` is as per the precondition, `sc` is as per the precondition, `S` is as per the precondition, `T` is as per the precondition, `flag` is 1, `i` is `N-2`. If `T[i]` is 'L', `AO[1]` is the minimum of `W` and `AO[1] + 1`. If `T[i]` is 'R', `AO[0]` is at least 1. If `T[i]` is 'U', `AO[3]` is `min(H, AO[3] + 1)`. If `T[i]` is 'D', `AO[2]` is `max(1, AO[2] - 1)`. In all cases, the variables retain their pre-execution states unless modified by the specific condition in the if part.***
