Postcondition: ***`H`, `W`, `N`, `sr`, `sc`, `S`, `T`, `flag`, `i`, `AO[0]`, `AO[1]`, `AO[2]`, `AO[3]` are as per the precondition. If `S[i]` is 'U', `AO[3]` is `min(H, AO[3] + 1)`, `AO[2]` is increased by 1, `AO[0]` is at least 1. If `S[i]` is 'D', `AO[3]` is decremented by 1.***

Explanation: 
- If `S[i]` is 'U', the following modifications are made: `AO[3]` is updated to the minimum of `H` and `AO[3] + 1`, `AO[2]` is incremented by 1, and `AO[0]` is ensured to be at least 1.
- If `S[i]` is 'D', `AO[3]` is decremented by 1.
- In both cases, all other variables (`H`, `W`, `N`, `sr`, `sc`, `S`, `T`, `flag`, `i`) remain unchanged as per the precondition.
