Postcondition: ***`H`, `W`, `N`, `sr`, `sc`, `S`, `T`, `AO`, and `flag` are as per the precondition. If `T[i]` is 'L' and the current value of `i` is equal to `N - 1`, then `AO[0]` is updated to 1, `AO[1]` is updated to `min(W, 2)`, and `AO[3]` remains unchanged. If `T[i]` is 'R', `AO[0]` is updated to 1. If `T[i]` is 'U', `AO[3]` is updated to `H`. If `T[i]` is 'D', the value of `T[i]` remains 'D'.***

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes of the if-else block, considering the conditions and updates applied in each branch.
