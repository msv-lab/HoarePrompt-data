According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `N-1` down to `0`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are true:
- `H` is as per the precondition
- `W` is as per the precondition
- `N` is as per the precondition
- `sr` is as per the precondition
- `sc` is as per the precondition
- `S` is as per the precondition
- `T` is as per the precondition
- `flag` is 1

The loop condition checks whether `i` is in the range from `N-1` down to `0`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 from its current value.

Given that the loop decrements `i` by 1 each time it runs, if `i` was previously `N-1`, it will now be `N-2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

Additionally, the loop does not modify any of the other variables (`H`, `W`, `N`, `sr`, `sc`, `S`, `T`, `flag`), so those remain unchanged.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

State: **`H` is as per the precondition, `W` is as per the precondition, `N` is as per the precondition, `sr` is as per the precondition, `sc` is as per the precondition, `S` is as per the precondition, `T` is as per the precondition, and `flag` is 1, `i` is N-2**
