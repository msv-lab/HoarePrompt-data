Postcondition: ***`H`, `W`, `N`, `sr`, `sc`, `S`, `T`, and `flag` remain unchanged. If `T[i]` is 'R', then `AO[0]` is updated to 1. If `T[i]` is not 'R' and the current value of `i` is equal to `N - 1`, then `AO[0]`, `AO[1]`, and `AO[3]` remain unchanged. If `T[i]` is not 'R' and `S[i]` is 'U', then `AO[2]` is increased by 1. If `T[i]` is not 'R' and `S[i]` is 'D', then `AO[3]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `AO[3]` remains unchanged and `AO[0]` and `AO[1]` remain unchanged.***
