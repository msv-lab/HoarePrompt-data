Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the piece will remain on the grid at the end of the game. Specifically, the program fails to account for optimal moves by both players. Here are the key issues:

1. **Direction Updates**: The program updates the boundaries (`AO`) based on the moves made by both players in reverse order. However, it does not simulate the optimal moves where both players try to prevent or ensure the piece stays on the grid, respectively.

2. **Optimal Moves**: The problem requires both players to play optimally. The current implementation does not reflect this strategy. For example, if Takahashi can move the piece to the edge, Aoki should ideally move the piece away from the edge to keep it on the grid. Conversely, if Aoki wants to remove the piece, they should move towards the edge.

3. **Boundary Conditions**: The program checks if the piece is out of bounds using the final values of `AO[0]`, `AO[1]`, `AO[2]`, and `AO[3]`. However, it does not correctly simulate the game where both players make optimal moves. For instance, if Takahashi moves the piece towards the edge and Aoki tries to move it back, the piece may still be on the grid even if `AO[0] > sc` or `AO[1] < sc` etc., at the end of the game.

To correctly implement the logic, the program needs to simulate the game step-by-step while considering the optimal moves of both players. The current approach only checks the final position without simulating the game flow and optimal strategies.

Therefore, the program does not correctly follow the problem description and thus is incorrect.
