You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: We have a rectangular grid of squares with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns. Let (i,j) denote the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left. On this grid, there is a piece, which is initially placed at square (s_r,s_c).

Takahashi and Aoki will play a game, where each player has a string of length N. Takahashi's string is S, and Aoki's string is T. S and T both consist of four kinds of letters: `L`, `R`, `U` and `D`.

The game consists of N steps. The i-th step proceeds as follows:

* First, Takahashi performs a move. He either moves the piece in the direction of S_i, or does not move the piece.
* Second, Aoki performs a move. He either moves the piece in the direction of T_i, or does not move the piece.



Here, to move the piece in the direction of `L`, `R`, `U` and `D`, is to move the piece from square (r,c) to square (r,c-1), (r,c+1), (r-1,c) and (r+1,c), respectively. If the destination square does not exist, the piece is removed from the grid, and the game ends, even if less than N steps are done.

Takahashi wants to remove the piece from the grid in one of the N steps. Aoki, on the other hand, wants to finish the N steps with the piece remaining on the grid. Determine if the piece will remain on the grid at the end of the game when both players play optimally.

Constraints

* 2 \leq H,W \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 1 \leq s_r \leq H
* 1 \leq s_c \leq W
* |S|=|T|=N
* S and T consists of the four kinds of letters `L`, `R`, `U` and `D`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


H W N
s_r s_c

Output

If the piece will remain on the grid at the end of the game, print `YES`; otherwise, print `NO`.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: H and W are integers such that 2 ≤ H, W ≤ 2 × 10^5, s_r and s_c are integers such that 1 ≤ s_r ≤ H and 1 ≤ s_c ≤ W, N is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5, S and T are strings consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D' such that |S| = |T| = N.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
