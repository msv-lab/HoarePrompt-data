You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have a rectangular grid of squares with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns. Let (i,j) denote the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left. On this grid, there is a piece, which is initially placed at square (s_r,s_c).

Takahashi and Aoki will play a game, where each player has a string of length N. Takahashi's string is S, and Aoki's string is T. S and T both consist of four kinds of letters: `L`, `R`, `U` and `D`.

The game consists of N steps. The i-th step proceeds as follows:

* First, Takahashi performs a move. He either moves the piece in the direction of S_i, or does not move the piece.
* Second, Aoki performs a move. He either moves the piece in the direction of T_i, or does not move the piece.



Here, to move the piece in the direction of `L`, `R`, `U` and `D`, is to move the piece from square (r,c) to square (r,c-1), (r,c+1), (r-1,c) and (r+1,c), respectively. If the destination square does not exist, the piece is removed from the grid, and the game ends, even if less than N steps are done.

Takahashi wants to remove the piece from the grid in one of the N steps. Aoki, on the other hand, wants to finish the N steps with the piece remaining on the grid. Determine if the piece will remain on the grid at the end of the game when both players play optimally.

Constraints

* 2 \leq H,W \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 1 \leq s_r \leq H
* 1 \leq s_c \leq W
* |S|=|T|=N
* S and T consists of the four kinds of letters `L`, `R`, `U` and `D`.

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

If the piece will remain on the grid at the end of the game, print `YES`; otherwise, print `NO`.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Directions**: The program updates the boundaries (AO) in a way that does not correctly simulate the movement of the piece. For instance, if `T[i] == 'L'`, the right boundary should decrease, and if `T[i] == 'R'`, the left boundary should increase. Similarly, for `U` and `D`, the boundaries should adjust accordingly. However, the current implementation does not properly handle these adjustments.

2. **Boundary Conditions Check**: The final check `if AO[0] > sc or AO[1] < sc or AO[2] > sr or (AO[3] < sr):` is incorrect because it does not account for the dynamic changes in the boundaries throughout the game. This check should be performed after updating the boundaries for each step.

3. **Flag Setting**: The flag `flag` is set only once after the loop, but it should be set whenever the piece goes out of bounds during any step of the game.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
4 3 5
2 2
UDRRR
LLDUD
```
In this case, the piece starts at (2, 2). The movements are as follows:
- U: Move up to (1, 2)
- D: Move down to (2, 2)
- R: Move right to (2, 3) - the piece is now out of bounds (since the right boundary is 2).
- R: Stay at (2, 3)
- D: Move down to (3, 3)

However, the program incorrectly handles these movements and does not detect that the piece is out of bounds after the first right move. This is due to the incorrect boundary update logic.

A corrected version would properly update the boundaries and check them after each move, ensuring that the piece stays within the grid.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func()` accepts parameters `H`, `W`, `s_r`, `s_c`, `N`, `S`, and `T`, which represent the dimensions of a grid, starting coordinates, and two strings of moves. It processes these inputs to determine if a certain set of moves described by `S` and `T` can be performed without violating the grid boundaries. Specifically, the function checks if the sequence of moves in `S` and `T` keeps the player within the grid bounds defined by `H` and `W`. If the player stays within the grid throughout the moves, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function uses an auxiliary array `AO` to track the dynamic bounds of the grid during the process. If at any point the moves violate the grid boundaries, the function sets a flag to 1. The function handles edge cases where the dynamic bounds might become invalid due to overlapping moves in `S` and `T`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
