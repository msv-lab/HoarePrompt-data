You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: We have a rectangular grid of squares with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns. Let (i,j) denote the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left. On this grid, there is a piece, which is initially placed at square (s_r,s_c).

Takahashi and Aoki will play a game, where each player has a string of length N. Takahashi's string is S, and Aoki's string is T. S and T both consist of four kinds of letters: `L`, `R`, `U` and `D`.

The game consists of N steps. The i-th step proceeds as follows:

* First, Takahashi performs a move. He either moves the piece in the direction of S_i, or does not move the piece.
* Second, Aoki performs a move. He either moves the piece in the direction of T_i, or does not move the piece.



Here, to move the piece in the direction of `L`, `R`, `U` and `D`, is to move the piece from square (r,c) to square (r,c-1), (r,c+1), (r-1,c) and (r+1,c), respectively. If the destination square does not exist, the piece is removed from the grid, and the game ends, even if less than N steps are done.

Takahashi wants to remove the piece from the grid in one of the N steps. Aoki, on the other hand, wants to finish the N steps with the piece remaining on the grid. Determine if the piece will remain on the grid at the end of the game when both players play optimally.

Constraints

* 2 \leq H,W \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 1 \leq s_r \leq H
* 1 \leq s_c \leq W
* |S|=|T|=N
* S and T consists of the four kinds of letters `L`, `R`, `U` and `D`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Output

If the piece will remain on the grid at the end of the game, print `YES`; otherwise, print `NO`.
