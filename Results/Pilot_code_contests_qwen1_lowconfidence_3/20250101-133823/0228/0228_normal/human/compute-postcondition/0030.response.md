`pl` is initially assigned the value `vp * (2 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp`. The code then increments `pl` by `vp`. The other variables are not affected.

After executing `pl += vp`, the new value of `pl` is updated to `pl = vp * (2 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp + vp`.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer entered by the user and satisfies `vp <= c`, `vd` must be such that `vp * (3 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp <= c`, `t` is 3, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `c` is the integer input from `raw_input()`, `t_read` is an integer entered by the user through `raw_input()`, `dl` is `vp + vd`, and `pl` is `vp * (2 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp + vp`.**
