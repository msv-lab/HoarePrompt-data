The code `vp = int(raw_input())` assigns the value entered by the user (converted to an integer) to the variable `vp`. The other variables (`vd`, `t`, `f`, and `c`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer entered by the user, `vd` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10, `f` is an integer between 1 and 10, `c` is an integer between 1 and 1000.**
