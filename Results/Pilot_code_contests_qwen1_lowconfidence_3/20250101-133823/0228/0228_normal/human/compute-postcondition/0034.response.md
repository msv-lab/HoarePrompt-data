`pl` is assigned the value of itself plus `(2 * (dl / vd) + f) * vp`. The value of `dl` is `vp * (2 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp + vp`. Since `vd` and `f` are constants in this context, let's express `dl` more clearly:

\[ dl = vp \times (2 + f \times (vp / vd)) + vp + vp \]

Therefore,

\[ pl = pl + (2 \times (dl / vd) + f) \times vp \]

Given that `dl` is defined as above, we substitute `dl` into the equation for `pl`:

\[ pl = pl + (2 \times ((vp \times (2 + f \times (vp / vd)) + vp + vp) / vd) + f) \times vp \]

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer entered by the user and satisfies `vp <= c`, `vd` must be such that `vp * (3 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp <= c`, `t` is 3, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `c` is the integer input from `raw_input()`, `t_read` is an integer entered by the user through `raw_input()`, `dl` is `vp * (2 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp + vp`, `pl` is `pl + (2 \times ((vp \times (2 + f \times (vp / vd)) + vp + vp) / vd) + f) \times vp`, and `count` is increased by 1.**
