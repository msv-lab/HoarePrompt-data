`dl` is initially equal to `vp + vd`. The code snippet `dl += vd` adds the value of `vd` to `dl`. Therefore, the new value of `dl` is the original value of `dl` plus `vd`.

Since `dl` was originally `vp + vd`, adding `vd` to it results in `dl` being updated to `(vp + vd) + vd`, which simplifies to `vp + 2 * vd`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer entered by the user and satisfies `vp <= c`, `vd` must be such that `vp * (3 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp <= c`, `t` is 3, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `c` is the integer input from `raw_input()`, `t_read` is an integer entered by the user through `raw_input()`, `dl` is `vp + 2 * vd`, and `pl` is `vp * (2 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp + vp`.**
