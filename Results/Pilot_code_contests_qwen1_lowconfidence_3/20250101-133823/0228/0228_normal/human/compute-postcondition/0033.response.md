The code `dl = pl` assigns the value of `pl` to `dl`. According to the initial state, `pl` is defined as `vp * (2 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp + vp`. Therefore, `dl` is now equal to this expression. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer entered by the user and satisfies `vp <= c`, `vd` must be such that `vp * (3 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp <= c`, `t` is 3, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `c` is the integer input from `raw_input()`, `t_read` is an integer entered by the user through `raw_input()`, `dl` is `vp * (2 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp + vp`, `pl` is `vp * (2 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp + vp`, and `count` is increased by 1.**
