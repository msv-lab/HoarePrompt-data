`pl` is initially calculated as `vp * (2 + f * (vp / vd))`. The code `pl += vp` increments `pl` by `vp`. Therefore, the new value of `pl` is `vp * (2 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer entered by the user and satisfies `vp <= c`, `vd` must be such that `vp * (3 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp <= c`, `t` is 2, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `c` is the integer input from `raw_input()`, `t_read` is an integer entered by the user through `raw_input()`, `pl` is `vp * (2 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp`, `dl` is `vp`, and `count` is 0 if `t_read` is 1, otherwise `count` is 0.**
