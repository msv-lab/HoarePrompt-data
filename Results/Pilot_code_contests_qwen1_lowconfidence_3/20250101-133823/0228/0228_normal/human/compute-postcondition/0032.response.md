`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `vp`, `vd`, `t`, `f`, `c`, `t_read`, `dl`, and `pl` remain unchanged as the code does not affect these variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `vp` is an integer entered by the user and satisfies `vp <= c`, `vd` must be such that `vp * (3 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp <= c`, `t` is 3, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `c` is the integer input from `raw_input()`, `t_read` is an integer entered by the user through `raw_input()`, `dl` is `vp + 2 * vd`, `pl` is `vp * (2 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp + vp`, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer entered by the user and satisfies `vp <= c`, `vd` must be such that `vp * (3 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp <= c`, `t` is 3, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `c` is the integer input from `raw_input()`, `t_read` is an integer entered by the user through `raw_input()`, `dl` is `vp + 2 * vd`, `pl` is `vp * (2 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp + vp`, and `count` is increased by 1.**
