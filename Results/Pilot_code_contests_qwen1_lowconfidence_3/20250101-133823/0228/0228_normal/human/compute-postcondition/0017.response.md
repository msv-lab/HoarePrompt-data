Postcondition: ***`vp` is an integer entered by the user and satisfies `vp <= c`, `vd` is an integer entered by the user, `t` is 1, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `c` is the integer input from `raw_input()`, `t_read` is an integer entered by the user through `raw_input()`, `pl` is either `vp * (2 + f * (vp / vd))` or `vp` depending on the condition, `dl` is `vp`, `count` is 1, and the current value of `t` is greater than `t_read`.***
