Output State: **`vp` is an integer entered by the user and satisfies `vp <= c`, `vd` must be such that `vp * (t - 1 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp * (t - 2) <= c`, `t` is `t + 1`, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `c` is the integer input from `raw_input()`, `t_read` is an integer entered by the user through `raw_input()`, `pl` is `vp * (t - 1 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp * (t - 2)`, `dl` is `vp * (t - 1 + f * (vp / vd)) + vp * (t - 2)`, and `count` is the number of times the condition `dl >= pl and pl + vp <= c` holds true.**
