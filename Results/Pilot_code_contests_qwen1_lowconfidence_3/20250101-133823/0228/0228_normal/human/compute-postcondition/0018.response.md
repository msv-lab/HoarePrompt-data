Postcondition: ***`vp` is an integer entered by the user and satisfies `vp <= c`, `vd` is an integer entered by the user, `t` is 1, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `c` is the integer input from `raw_input()`, `t_read` is an integer entered by the user through `raw_input()`, `pl` is either `vp * (2 + f * (vp / vd))` or `vp` depending on whether `t` is greater than `t_read`, `dl` is `vp`, and `count` is 1 if `t` is greater than `t_read`, otherwise `count` remains 0.***
