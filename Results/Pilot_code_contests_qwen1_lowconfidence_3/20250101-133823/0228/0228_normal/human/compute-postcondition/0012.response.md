`dl` is incremented by `vd`. The initial value of `dl` is `0`, so after adding `vd`, the new value of `dl` is `vd`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer entered by the user and satisfies `vp <= c`, `vd` is an integer entered by the user, `t` is 1, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `c` is the integer input from `raw_input()`, `t_read` is an integer entered by the user through `raw_input()`, `pl` is `vp`, `dl` is `vd`, `count` is 0, and the current value of `t` is greater than `t_read`.**
