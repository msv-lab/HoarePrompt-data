The function `func` accepts five parameters: `vp`, `vd`, `t`, `f`, and `c`. The constraints are that `vp` and `vd` are integers such that 1 ≤ vp, vd ≤ 100, `t` and `f` are integers such that 1 ≤ t, f ≤ 10, and `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000. The function does not return a value based on the given constraints alone but rather processes these inputs. However, since no specific return conditions are provided beyond the parameter constraints, we focus on the inputs.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept five integer parameters `vp`, `vd`, `t`, `f`, and `c`, where each parameter has specific constraints as described.

Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters: `vp`, `vd`, `t`, `f`, and `c`, where `vp` and `vd` are integers between 1 and 100, inclusive, `t` and `f` are integers between 1 and 10, inclusive, and `c` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.**
