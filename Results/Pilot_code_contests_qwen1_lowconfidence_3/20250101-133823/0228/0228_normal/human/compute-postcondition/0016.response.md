`pl` is assigned the value of itself plus the result of `(2 * (dl / vd) + f) * vp`. Here, `pl` is initially equal to `vp`, `dl` is equal to `vp`, and `vp`, `vd`, `f`, and `vp` are integers. The value of `pl` will be updated based on these values.

Let's calculate the new value of `pl`:
1. Calculate `2 * (dl / vd) + f`: Since `dl` is equal to `vp`, this becomes `2 * (vp / vd) + f`.
2. Multiply the result by `vp`: This becomes `(2 * (vp / vd) + f) * vp`.

So, the new value of `pl` will be:
\[ pl = vp + (2 * (vp / vd) + f) * vp \]

Since `pl` was initially equal to `vp`, the updated value of `pl` will be:
\[ pl = vp + vp * (2 * (vp / vd) + f) \]
\[ pl = vp + vp^2 / vd + vp * f \]
\[ pl = vp * (1 + 1 + f * (vp / vd)) \]
\[ pl = vp * (2 + f * (vp / vd)) \]

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`vp` is an integer entered by the user and satisfies `vp <= c`, `vd` is an integer entered by the user, `t` is 1, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `c` is the integer input from `raw_input()`, `t_read` is an integer entered by the user through `raw_input()`, `pl` is `vp * (2 + f * (vp / vd))`, `dl` is `vp`, `count` is 1, and the current value of `t` is greater than `t_read`.**
