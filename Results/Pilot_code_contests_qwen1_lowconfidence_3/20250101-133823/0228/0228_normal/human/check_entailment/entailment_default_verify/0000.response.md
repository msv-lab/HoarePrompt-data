Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the dragon overtakes the princess exactly when she reaches the castle. According to the problem description, in such a case, the princess should not need an additional bijou. However, the current implementation does not account for this edge case, leading to incorrect results. The output hints also confirm that the program needs to handle this specific scenario properly to be considered correct. Therefore, the original assessment remains valid.
