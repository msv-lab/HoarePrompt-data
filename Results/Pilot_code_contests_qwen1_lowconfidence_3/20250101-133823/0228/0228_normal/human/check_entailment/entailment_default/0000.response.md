Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the scenario where the dragon overtakes the princess at exactly the same moment she has reached the castle. According to the problem description, if the dragon overtakes the princess at exactly the same moment she has reached the castle, she should be considered to have reached the castle before the dragon, and thus, she wouldn't need an additional bijou. However, the current implementation does not account for this edge case properly. For example, if the inputs are:

```
vp = 1
vd = 2
t_read = 1
f = 1
c = 8
```

In this case, the princess will reach the castle after 8 hours, and the dragon will start chasing her after 1 hour. The dragon will overtake the princess at the 8th hour, which is exactly when the princess reaches the castle. Therefore, the princess should not need an additional bijou, but the current implementation would incorrectly count one bijou as needed. This is a clear case where the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
