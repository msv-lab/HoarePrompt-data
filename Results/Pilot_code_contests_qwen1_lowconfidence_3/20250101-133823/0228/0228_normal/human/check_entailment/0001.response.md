Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the dragon overtakes the princess exactly at the castle. Specifically, the condition `if pl + vp <= c:` in the loop does not account for the case where the princess reaches the castle before the dragon overtakes her. This can lead to the program underestimating the number of bijous needed. 

For example, consider the second test case provided:

Input:
```
1
2
1
1
8
```

The correct output should be `1` because the dragon will overtake the princess exactly at the castle, and she won't need an additional bijou. However, the current implementation might count an extra bijou in this scenario, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the condition checking if the dragon overtakes the princess should be adjusted to correctly handle the case where the princess reaches the castle before the dragon overtakes her.
