The function `func` accepts two parameters, `N` and `X`, where `N` is an integer between 2 and \(10^{12}\), and `X` is an integer between 1 and \(N-1\). The function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `X` and `N - X` using the Euclidean algorithm and updates the result (`res`) accordingly. The function then prints the final value of `res`, which is `N + 2 * GCD * k`, where `k` is the number of subtractions performed during the process. The function does not return anything explicitly; instead, it relies on printing the result directly. Potential edge cases include when `N` is at its minimum value (2) and `X` is 1, or when `X` is close to `N`. The function does not handle these cases specifically within the provided code.
