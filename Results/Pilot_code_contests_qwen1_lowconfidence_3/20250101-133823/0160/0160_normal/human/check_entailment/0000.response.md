Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the total length of the ray's trajectory. The logic in the `while` loop does not accurately simulate the reflection process described in the problem. Specifically, the program does not account for the correct multiple reflections and the behavior of the ray as it changes directions upon hitting the mirrors.

To illustrate why this program is incorrect, consider the following example:

For \( N = 5 \) and \( X = 2 \), the expected output is 12, as shown in the problem description. However, the program fails to produce this result because it does not properly handle the reflections and the changing directions of the ray.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the issue:

1. The program initializes the variables `a` and `b` with the initial values of `x` and `n-x`, respectively.
2. It enters a `while` loop that continues until `a` equals `b`.
3. Inside the loop, it attempts to reduce the values of `a` and `b` by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) and scaling accordingly. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the path of the ray through the reflections.

A correct solution would involve a different approach to track the path of the ray and ensure that the total length is calculated accurately, taking into account all reflections and changes in direction. The given program does not achieve this, leading to incorrect results for many inputs.
