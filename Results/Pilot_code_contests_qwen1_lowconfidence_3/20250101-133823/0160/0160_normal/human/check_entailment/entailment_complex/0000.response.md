Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem requires the program to calculate the total length of the ray's trajectory when a ray is fired inside an equilateral triangle formed by three mirrors of length \(N\), starting from a point \(p\) on segment \(ab\) such that \(ap = X\).

However, the provided program does not actually simulate the path of the ray or calculate the total length of the ray's trajectory. Instead, it uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of \(X\) and \(N - X\) and prints a result based on this GCD, which is not related to the actual trajectory length.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the reflections and count the number of times the ray reflects until it returns to the starting point. The total length of the ray's trajectory would be calculated based on the number of reflections and the length of each segment traveled.

Here is a brief explanation of why the current program does not work:
1. **Incorrect Approach**: The program incorrectly assumes that the total length of the ray's trajectory can be derived from the GCD of \(X\) and \(N - X\).
2. **Lack of Trajectory Simulation**: The program does not simulate the actual path of the ray and count the number of segments traveled.
3. **Irrelevant Output**: The output of the program does not represent the total length of the ray's trajectory as required by the problem.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem and is thus incorrect.
