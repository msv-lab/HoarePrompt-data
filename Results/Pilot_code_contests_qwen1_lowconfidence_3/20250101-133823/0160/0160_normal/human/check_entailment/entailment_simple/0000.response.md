Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding the total length of the ray's trajectory, which involves understanding the path of the ray as it bounces off the mirrors and eventually returns to the starting point. However, the current implementation calculates something different.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program attempts to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `n - x` and uses this to compute the result. While this might be part of the solution in some context, it doesn't directly relate to calculating the total length of the ray's trajectory as described.

2. **Missing Trajectory Calculation**: The program does not simulate the actual path of the ray as it bounces off the mirrors. It only computes a value based on the GCD, which does not account for the reflective behavior or the total distance traveled.

3. **Path Simulation**: To correctly calculate the total length of the ray's trajectory, you would need to simulate the path of the ray as it reflects off the mirrors and returns to the starting point. This involves understanding how the ray bounces and the geometry of the equilateral triangle.

4. **Example Verification**: Given the example provided (`N = 5`, `X = 2`), the expected output should be `12`. The provided program does not produce this output. Instead, it appears to be computing something related to the GCD, which is not the correct approach for this problem.

To correctly implement the solution, you would need to simulate the path of the ray as it reflects off the mirrors and returns to the starting point. This involves understanding the geometry of the equilateral triangle and how the ray behaves when it hits each side.

In conclusion, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and therefore is incorrect.
