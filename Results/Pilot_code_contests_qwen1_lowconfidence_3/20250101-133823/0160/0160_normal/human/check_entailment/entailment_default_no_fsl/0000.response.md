Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. The key issue is that the code does not properly simulate the reflection process of the ray of Mysterious Light in an equilateral triangle formed by three mirrors. Instead, it attempts to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `X` and `N - X` and uses it to compute the total length of the ray's trajectory, which is not accurate.

To correctly solve this problem, the code needs to simulate the reflection process. Hereâ€™s a brief outline of what the correct approach should do:

1. Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `N` and `2*X` because the ray travels in a straight line until it hits a mirror and gets reflected.
2. Use the properties of the equilateral triangle to determine the total path length.

The given code does not account for the actual reflection process and instead uses a different approach that does not match the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
