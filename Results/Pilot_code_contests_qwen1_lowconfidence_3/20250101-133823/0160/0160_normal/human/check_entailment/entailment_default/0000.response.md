Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. The problem requires finding the total length of the ray's trajectory in an equilateral triangle formed by three mirrors, where the ray is fired from a point \(p\) on side \(ab\) towards side \(bc\). The ray is reflected according to the rules specified and eventually returns to the rifle, getting absorbed.

The code provided attempts to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(X\) and \(N - X\) using the Euclidean algorithm and updates the result accordingly. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the path of the ray as described in the problem. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The provided code does not simulate the reflection process accurately. It assumes that the GCD calculation and subsequent updates will correctly determine the total path length, but this is not the case. The ray's path involves multiple reflections, and simply calculating the GCD does not account for the full trajectory.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The code does not handle specific edge cases such as when \(N = 2\) and \(X = 1\), or when \(X\) is very close to \(N\). For instance, in the given example \(N = 5\) and \(X = 2\), the ray's path is more complex and involves multiple reflections that are not accounted for by simply calculating the GCD.

3. **Missing Simulation**: The code lacks the logic to simulate the actual path of the ray through multiple reflections, which is crucial for determining the total length of the trajectory. The provided code only performs a simplified calculation that does not reflect the complexity of the ray's path.

Therefore, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution for every potential case, and hence the correctness is **False**.
