Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to account for the scenario where `a` and `b` are equal but greater than zero. In the problem description, it states that the ray will continue reflecting until it returns to the rifle. However, the current implementation does not properly handle this scenario and instead stops the loop prematurely.

For example, consider the case where `N = 3` and `X = 1`. According to the problem description, the ray should reflect back to the rifle after traveling a total distance of `6`. However, the current implementation will incorrectly stop the loop and return a result of `3`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the loop condition should check if either `a` or `b` is zero before exiting the loop. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    L = map(int, raw_input().split())
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    res = n
    a = x
    b = n - x
    flag = True
    while flag:
        if a > b:
            q = a // b
            a -= q * b
            res += 2 * q * b
        elif b > a:
            q = b // a
            b -= q * a
            res += 2 * a * q
        else:
            res += a + b
            flag = False
    print(res)
```

This corrected version ensures that the loop continues until both `a` and `b` are zero, thus correctly simulating the reflection process until the ray returns to the rifle.
