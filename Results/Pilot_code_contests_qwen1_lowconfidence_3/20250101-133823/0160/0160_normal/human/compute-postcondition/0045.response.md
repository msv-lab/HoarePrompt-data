The code `print(res)` prints the value of the variable `res` but does not change its value. Therefore, the value of `res` remains unchanged after executing this line of code. The states of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `flag`, and `k`) are not affected.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are equal, representing the GCD of `x` and `n - x`, `res` is equal to `n + 2 * GCD * k`, where `k` is the number of subtractions performed, and `flag` is `False`.**
