Functionality: **The function `func` accepts two parameters, `N` and `X`, where `N` is an integer between 2 and \(10^{12}\), and `X` is an integer between 1 and \(N-1\). The function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `X` and `N - X` using the Euclidean algorithm and updates the result (`res`) accordingly. The function then prints the final value of `res`, which is `N + 2 * GCD * k`, where `k` is the number of subtractions performed during the process. The function does not return anything explicitly; instead, it relies on printing the result directly. Potential edge cases include when `N` is at its minimum value (2) and `X` is 1, or when `X` is close to `N`. The function does not handle these cases specifically within the provided code.**

**Missing functionality:**
- There is no handling for the case when `N` is 2 and `X` is 1. In this scenario, the GCD would be 1, but the provided code does not account for this specific situation.
- The code does not check if `N` is exactly 2 and `X` is 1, which would lead to an incorrect result since the GCD of 1 and 1 is 1, not 2 + 2*1*1 = 4.**

**Final state of the program: After the function concludes, the program will have printed the value of `res`, which is `N + 2 * GCD * k`, where `GCD` is the greatest common divisor of `X` and `N - X`, and `k` is the number of subtractions performed. The variables `a` and `b` will be equal, representing the GCD, and `flag` will be `False`.**
