`res` is assigned the value of `res + 2 * q * b`. The value of `q` depends on whether `a` was equal to `b` (which determines the initial state of `q`). Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `a` and `b`, we consider two cases: when `a` is equal to `b` and when `a` is not equal to `b`.

- If `a` is equal to `b`, then `q` is 1. So, `res` becomes `res + 2 * 1 * b`, which simplifies to `res + 2 * b`.
- If `a` is not equal to `b`, then `q` is 0. So, `res` remains `res` because `2 * 0 * b` equals 0.

In both cases, the initial state of `a` and `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is 0 if `a` was equal to `b`, otherwise `a` is unchanged; `b` is unchanged; `q` is 1 if `a` was equal to `b`, otherwise `q` is 0; `res` is `res + 2 * b` if `a` was equal to `b`, otherwise `res` is unchanged.**
