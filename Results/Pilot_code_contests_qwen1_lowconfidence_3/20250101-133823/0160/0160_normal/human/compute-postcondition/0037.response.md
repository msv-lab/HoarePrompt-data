`q` is assigned the value of `b // a`. Given that `a` must be less than or equal to `b`, the value of `q` will be an integer such that `q * a` is the greatest multiple of `a` that is less than or equal to `b`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` must be less than or equal to `b`, `q` is `b // a`**
