`a` is assigned the value of `x`, which is the second element of the list `L`. The values of `N`, `X`, `L`, `n`, `x`, and `res` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 ≦ N ≦ 10^{12}; `X` is an integer such that 1 ≦ X ≦ N-1; `L` is a list of integers read from the input and split, with at least two elements; `n` is the first element of `L`; `x` is the second element of `L`; `res` is equal to `n`; `a` is equal to `x`.
