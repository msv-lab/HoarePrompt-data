The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`, but this does not affect the values of `a` and `b`. The value of `res` is equal to its original value plus `a`, but since the code does not explicitly update `res`, it remains unchanged from its original value.

Output State: **`a` must be less than or equal to `b`; `res` is equal to its original value plus `a`, `flag` is `False`**
