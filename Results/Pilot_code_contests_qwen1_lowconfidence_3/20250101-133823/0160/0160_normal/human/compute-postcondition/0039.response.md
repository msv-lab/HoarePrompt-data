The code updates the value of `res` by adding `2 * a * q` to its current value. Here, `q` is the quotient when `b` is divided by `a`, and `b` is the remainder when `b` is divided by `a`. Since the exact value of `res` was not specified in the initial state, let's denote the initial value of `res` as `res_initial`.

Given:
- `q = b // a`
- `b = b % a`

The updated value of `res` will be `res_initial + 2 * a * q`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` must be less than or equal to `b`; `q` is `b // a`; `b` is the remainder of `b` divided by `a`; `res` is `res_initial + 2 * a * q`**
