The code assigns the second element of the list `L` to the variable `x`. The first element of `L` is `n`, which means `x` is assigned the value of `L[1]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≦ N ≦ 10^{12}, and `X` is an integer such that 1 ≦ X ≦ N-1; `L` is a list of integers read from the input and split, with at least two elements; `n` is the first element of `L`; `x` is the second element of `L`.**
