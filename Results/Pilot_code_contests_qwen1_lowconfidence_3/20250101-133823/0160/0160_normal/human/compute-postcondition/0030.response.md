The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`. The value of `a` is still greater than `b`, and the value of `res` is increased by `a`, which means `res` now equals `2 * a` (since it was initially increased by `a`). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is greater than `b`; `res` is equal to `2 * a`; `flag` is `False`**
