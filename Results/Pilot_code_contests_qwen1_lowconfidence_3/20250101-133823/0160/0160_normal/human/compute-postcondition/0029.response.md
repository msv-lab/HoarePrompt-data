`res` is assigned the value of `res + a`. The initial condition is that `a` must be greater than `b`. Since `a` is greater than `b`, `res` is incremented by `a`. The state of `a` and `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is greater than `b`; `res` is increased by `a`.

Output State: **`a` is greater than `b`; `res` is increased by `a`**
