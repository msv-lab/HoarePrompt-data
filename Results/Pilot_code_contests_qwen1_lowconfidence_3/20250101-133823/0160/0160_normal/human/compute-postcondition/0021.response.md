Postcondition: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≦ N ≦ 10^{12}; `X` is an integer such that 1 ≦ X ≦ N-1; `L` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `n` is the first element of `L`; `x` is the second element of `L`; if `a > b`, then `res` is equal to `n + 2 * q * (n - x)`, `a` is equal to `x % (n - x)`, `b` is equal to `n - x`, `flag` is `True`; if `b > a`, then `res` is equal to `n + 2 * x * (n // x - 1)`, otherwise `res` is equal to `res + (n - x)`, `a` is equal to `x`, `b` is equal to `n - x`, `flag` is `False`.**
