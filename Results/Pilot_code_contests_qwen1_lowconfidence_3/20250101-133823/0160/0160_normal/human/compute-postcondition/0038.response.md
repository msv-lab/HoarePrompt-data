`q` is calculated as `b // a`. This means `q` is the integer division of `b` by `a`. Then `b` is updated to `b - q * a`. Given the initial condition that `a` must be less than or equal to `b`, this operation effectively updates `b` to its remainder when divided by `a`. Therefore, the new value of `b` is the remainder of `b` divided by `a`.

Since `b -= q * a` performs the operation `b = b - (b // a) * a`, it means `b` is now the remainder of `b` divided by `a`. Hence, the Output State is: `a` must be less than or equal to `b`; `q` is `b // a`; `b` is the remainder of `b` divided by `a`.

Output State: **`a` must be less than or equal to `b`; `q` is `b // a`; `b` is the remainder of `b` divided by `a`.**
