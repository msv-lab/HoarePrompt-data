`res` is incremented by `2 * q * b`. From the previous state, we know `q` is the quotient of `x` divided by `n - x`, `b` is equal to `n - x`, and `n` and `x` are the first and second elements of list `L`, respectively. 

Let's break down the calculation:

1. Calculate `q`: The quotient of `x` divided by `n - x`.
2. Calculate `b`: The remainder of `x` divided by `n - x`, which is already given as `n - x`.
3. Update `res` with `res += 2 * q * b`.

Since `b` is `n - x`, we can simplify the expression to `res += 2 * q * (n - x)`.

Therefore, the new value of `res` will be the old value of `res` plus `2 * q * (n - x)`, where `q` is the quotient of `x` divided by `n - x`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≦ N ≦ 10^{12}; `X` is an integer such that 1 ≦ X ≦ N-1; `L` is a list of integers read from the input and split, with at least two elements; `n` is the first element of `L`; `x` is the second element of `L`; `res` is equal to `n` plus `2 * q * (n - x)`, `a` is equal to `x % (n - x)`, `b` is equal to `n - x`, `flag` is `True`;**
