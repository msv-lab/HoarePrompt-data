`res` is assigned the value of `res + 2 * q * b`. Given that `q` is 0 and `b` is less than 0, the expression `2 * q * b` evaluates to 0 because anything multiplied by 0 is 0. Therefore, the value of `res` does not change. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is 0, `b` is less than 0, `q` is 0, `res` is unchanged**
