`a` is initially assigned the value of `x`, and `b` is assigned the value of `n - x`. The line `a -= q * b` updates the value of `a` by subtracting `q * b` from `a`. Given that `q` is the quotient when `a` is divided by `b`, the value of `a` will be updated to the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.

Since `a` is updated to the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, the new value of `a` is `a % b`. The value of `b` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≦ N ≦ 10^{12}; `X` is an integer such that 1 ≦ X ≦ N-1; `L` is a list of integers read from the input and split, with at least two elements; `n` is the first element of `L`; `x` is the second element of `L`; `res` is equal to `n`; `a` is equal to the remainder of `x` divided by `n - x`; `b` is equal to `n - x`; `flag` is `True`;**
