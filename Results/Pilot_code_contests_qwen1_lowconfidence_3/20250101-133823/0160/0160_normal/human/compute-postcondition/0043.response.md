Postcondition: **`a` is less than or equal to `b`. If `a` was equal to `b`, then `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `q` is 1, `res` is `res_initial + 2 * b`, and `flag` remains unchanged. If `a` was less than `b`, then `q` is the quotient of `b` divided by `a`, `b` is the remainder of `b` divided by `a`, `res` is `res_initial + 2 * a * q`, and `flag` remains unchanged. If `b <= a`, then `res` is `res_initial + a`, and `flag` is `False`.**
