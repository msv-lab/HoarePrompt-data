`q` is assigned the value of `b // a`. Since `a` must be greater than `b`, performing integer division of `b` by `a` would result in `q` being 0 because the division of a smaller number by a larger number yields 0 in integer division. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` must be greater than `b`; `q` is 0.

Output State: **`a` must be greater than `b`; `q` is 0**
