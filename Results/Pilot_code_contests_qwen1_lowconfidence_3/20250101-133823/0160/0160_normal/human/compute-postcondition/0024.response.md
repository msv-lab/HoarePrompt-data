`q` is initially `a // b`. The code `a -= q * b` updates the value of `a` by subtracting `q * b` from `a`. Since `q` is `a // b`, `q * b` is equal to `a`. Therefore, `a -= q * b` simplifies to `a -= a`, which means `a` becomes `0`.

The output state is: **`a` is 0, `b` is less than `a` (which is now 0), and `q` is `a // b` (which is 0).**

Output State: **`a` is 0, `b` is less than 0, `q` is 0**
