The value of `res` is incremented by `2 * a * q`. Given that `q` is 0, the expression `2 * a * q` evaluates to 0. Therefore, `res` does not change. The value of `b` remains unchanged, and the condition that `a` must be greater than `b` still holds.

Output State: **`a` must be greater than `b`, `q` is 0, `b` is unchanged, `res` is unchanged**
