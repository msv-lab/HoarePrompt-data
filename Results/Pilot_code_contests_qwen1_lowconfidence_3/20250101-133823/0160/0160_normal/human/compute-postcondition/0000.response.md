The code `L = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, and then converts each string to an integer, storing the resulting list of integers in `L`. The initial values of `N` and `X` are not directly affected by this operation, but their constraints remain the same.

Since the exact input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `L`, but we know that `L` will be a list of integers read from the input, and it will have at least two elements (since `N` is at least 2).

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≦ N ≦ 10^{12}, and `X` is an integer such that 1 ≦ X ≦ N-1; `L` is a list of integers read from the input and split, with at least two elements.**
