The code `res += a` updates the value of `res` by adding `a` to it. From the initial state, we know that `a` is equal to `n - x`. Therefore, `res` will be updated to `res + (n - x)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≦ N ≦ 10^{12}; `X` is an integer such that 1 ≦ X ≦ N-1; `L` is a list of integers read from the input and split, with at least two elements; `n` is the first element of `L`; `x` is the second element of `L`; `res` is equal to `res + (n - x)`, `a` is equal to `x`, `b` is equal to `n - x`, `flag` is `False`, `b` is less than or equal to `a`.**
