Precondition: **This function does not involve the variables related to the problem description. Instead, it deals with setting the synchronization of standard Python streams. However, based on the context provided, it seems this function might be part of a larger solution where `input` and `flush` are used to read input and manage output streams during the execution of the main logic. Therefore, we can infer that `input` is a function used to read a line of input from the user, and `flush` is a function to flush the output stream.**

To clarify the precondition for the actual problem-related function, here is how you would describe it:

```plaintext
Precondition: **n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^3. The variable 'nums' is a list of integers where each element is in the range 0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9.**
```

However, note that the provided `func_1` function does not contribute to solving the described problem directly and instead modifies the behavior of Python's standard input and output streams.
