The function `func_1()` reads a single line of space-separated integer inputs from the standard input, converts each element into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function does not accept any parameters and always returns a list of integers. Potential edge cases include the input being empty or containing non-integer values, which would result in the function attempting to convert invalid inputs and potentially raising a `ValueError`. The function does not handle these exceptions, so the returned list might contain fewer elements than the number of integers expected in the input.
