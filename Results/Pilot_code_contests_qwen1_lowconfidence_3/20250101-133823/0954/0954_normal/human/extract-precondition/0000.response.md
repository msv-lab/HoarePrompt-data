Precondition: **T is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of cards (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), r is a string representing the red digits on the cards (length of r is n, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), and b is a string representing the blue digits on the cards (length of b is n, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).**
