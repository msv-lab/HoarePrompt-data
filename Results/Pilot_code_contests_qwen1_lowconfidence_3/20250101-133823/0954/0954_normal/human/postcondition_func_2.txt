The function accepts an integer `a` (1 <= a <= 1000), and two strings `b` and `c` representing digits on cards. It compares the digits at each index of the two strings and counts how many times the digit in `b` is greater than, less than, or equal to the corresponding digit in `c`. After comparing all digits, it prints 'RED' if the count of digits in `b` being greater than those in `c` is more than the count of digits in `b` being less than those in `c`, prints 'BLUE' if the count of digits in `b` being less than those in `c` is more than the count of digits in `b` being greater than those in `c`, and prints 'EQUAL' otherwise.
