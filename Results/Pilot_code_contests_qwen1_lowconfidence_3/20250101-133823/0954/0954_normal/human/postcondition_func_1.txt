The function `func_2()` processes input from the standard input to extract the number of test cases and the number of cards for the current test case in each test scenario. It returns a map object containing two integers: the first integer represents the total number of test cases, and the second integer represents the number of cards for the current test case. The function assumes that the input format is consistent and that the input is provided as space-separated values. If the input format deviates from the expected format (e.g., incorrect number of inputs or non-integer values), the function will fail to parse the input correctly.
