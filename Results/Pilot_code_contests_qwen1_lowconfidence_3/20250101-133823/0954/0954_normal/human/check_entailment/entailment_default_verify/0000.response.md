Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_3` only compares the first digit of the red and blue strings and does not consider all possible permutations of the card orders. This approach is insufficient to determine the probabilities of `R > B`, `R < B`, and `R = B`. The output hints confirm that `func_3` only checks the first digit comparison, which means the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is justified.
