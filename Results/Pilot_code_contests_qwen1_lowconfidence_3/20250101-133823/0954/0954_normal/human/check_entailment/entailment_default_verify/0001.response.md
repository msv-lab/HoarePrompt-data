Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly handle the case where the red and blue digit strings are identical, leading to a tie (R = B). According to the problem description, in such cases, the output should be "EQUAL", but the current implementation prints "RED" or "BLUE" instead. The output hints confirm that `func_3()` is being called for each test case, and the function is supposed to compare the red and blue digit strings. However, the logic within `func_3()` does not account for the case where the two strings are equal, leading to incorrect outputs. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being False is justified.
