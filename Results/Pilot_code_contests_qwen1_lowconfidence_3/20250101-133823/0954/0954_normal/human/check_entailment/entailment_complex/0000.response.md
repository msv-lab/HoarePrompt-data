Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the red and blue digit strings have different lengths. According to the problem description, the red and blue digit strings for each card should have the same length. However, the code in `func_3()` compares the digits at each index of the red and blue strings, assuming they are of equal length. If the strings have different lengths, this will lead to an incorrect comparison.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
3
777
1111
3
314
159
```

In the first test case, the red string `777` and the blue string `1111` have different lengths, which violates the problem constraints. The code will attempt to compare characters at the fourth position (`1` vs `1`), which is out of bounds for the red string. This will result in incorrect behavior and potentially a runtime error.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case and hence is incorrect.
