You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n cards numbered 1, …, n. The card i has a red digit r_i and a blue digit b_i written on it.

We arrange all n cards in random order from left to right, with all permutations of 1, …, n having the same probability. We then read all red digits on the cards from left to right, and obtain an integer R. In the same way, we read all blue digits and obtain an integer B. When reading a number, leading zeros can be ignored. If all digits in a number are zeros, then the number is equal to 0. Below is an illustration of a possible rearrangement of three cards, and how R and B can be found.

<image>

Two players, Red and Blue, are involved in a bet. Red bets that after the shuffle R > B, and Blue bets that R < B. If in the end R = B, the bet results in a draw, and neither player wins.

Determine, which of the two players is more likely (has higher probability) to win the bet, or that their chances are equal. Refer to the Note section for a formal discussion of comparing probabilities.

Input

The first line contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

Descriptions of T test cases follow. Each test case description starts with a line containing a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of cards.

The following line contains a string of n digits r_1, …, r_n — red digits on cards 1, …, n respectively.

The following line contains a string of n digits b_1, …, b_n — blue digits on cards 1, …, n respectively.

Note that digits in the same line are not separated with any delimiters.

Output

Print T answers for the test cases in order, one per line.

If Red has a strictly higher change to win, print "RED".

If Blue has a strictly higher change to win, print "BLUE".

If both players are equally likely to win, print "EQUAL".

Note that all answers are case-sensitive.

Example

Input


3
3
777
111
3
314
159
5
09281
09281


Output


RED
BLUE
EQUAL

Note

Formally, let n_R be the number of permutations of cards 1, …, n such that the resulting numbers R and B satisfy R > B. Similarly, let n_B be the number of permutations such that R < B. If n_R > n_B, you should print "RED". If n_R < n_B, you should print "BLUE". If n_R = n_B, print "EQUAL".

In the first sample case, R = 777 and B = 111 regardless of the card order, thus Red always wins.

In the second sample case, there are two card orders when Red wins, and four card orders when Blue wins:

  * order 1, 2, 3: 314 > 159;
  * order 1, 3, 2: 341 > 195;
  * order 2, 1, 3: 134 < 519;
  * order 2, 3, 1: 143 < 591;
  * order 3, 1, 2: 431 < 915;
  * order 3, 2, 1: 413 < 951.



Since R < B is more frequent, the answer is "BLUE".

In the third sample case, R = B regardless of the card order, thus the bet is always a draw, and both Red and Blue have zero chance to win.
Annotated Functions:

import sys, math, bisect, itertools

input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()

    func_4()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the provided function `func_1()` are present in the function signature, so there are no specific conditions or descriptions about the variables' values. However, the function reads input and splits it into a list of integers.
def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that are the result of converting each element from a space-separated string input into an integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1()` reads a single line of space-separated integer inputs from the standard input, converts each element into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function does not accept any parameters and always returns a list of integers. Potential edge cases include the input being empty or containing non-integer values, which would result in the function attempting to convert invalid inputs and potentially raising a `ValueError`. The function does not handle these exceptions, so the returned list might contain fewer elements than the number of integers expected in the input.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The variable T is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is an integer representing the number of cards, followed by two strings of digits representing the red and blue digits on the cards respectively.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing two integers. The first integer represents the number of test cases, and the second integer represents the number of cards for the current test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` processes input from the standard input to extract the number of test cases and the number of cards for the current test case in each test scenario. It returns a map object containing two integers: the first integer represents the total number of test cases, and the second integer represents the number of cards for the current test case. The function assumes that the input format is consistent and that the input is provided as space-separated values. If the input format deviates from the expected format (e.g., incorrect number of inputs or non-integer values), the function will fail to parse the input correctly.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of cards (1 <= a <= 1000), b is a string representing the red digits on the cards, and c is a string representing the blue digits on the cards. Each character in b and c is a digit (0-9) and represents the corresponding digit on the card.
def func_3():
    a = int(input())
    b = input()
    c = input()
    first = 0
    second = 0
    for i in range(a):
        if int(b[i]) > int(c[i]):
            first += 1
        elif int(b[i]) < int(c[i]):
            second += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` must be a positive integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string can be converted to an integer, `c` is a list of strings where each string can be converted to an integer, `first` is the count of indices where the integer value of `b[i]` is greater than the integer value of `c[i]`, and `second` is the count of indices where the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]`. If `a` is 0 or either `b` or `c` do not contain enough elements, the loop does not execute and `first` and `second` remain as their initial values of 0.
    if (first > second) :
        print('RED')
    else :
        if (second > first) :
            print('BLUE')
        else :
            print('EQUAL')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string can be converted to an integer, `c` is a list of strings where each string can be converted to an integer, `first` is the count of indices where the integer value of `b[i]` is greater than the integer value of `c[i]`, `second` is the count of indices where the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]`. If `second` is greater than `first`, the string 'BLUE' is printed to the console. Otherwise, the string 'EQUAL' is printed to the console.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string can be converted to an integer, `c` is a list of strings where each string can be converted to an integer, `first` is the count of indices where the integer value of `b[i]` is greater than the integer value of `c[i]`, and `second` is the count of indices where the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]`. If `first` is greater than `second`, the string 'RED' is printed. Otherwise, if `second` is greater than or equal to `first`, the string 'BLUE' or 'EQUAL' is printed based on the comparison.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `a` (1 <= a <= 1000), and two strings `b` and `c` representing digits on cards. It compares the digits at each index of the two strings and counts how many times the digit in `b` is greater than, less than, or equal to the corresponding digit in `c`. After comparing all digits, it prints 'RED' if the count of digits in `b` being greater than those in `c` is more than the count of digits in `b` being less than those in `c`, prints 'BLUE' if the count of digits in `b` being less than those in `c` is more than the count of digits in `b` being greater than those in `c`, and prints 'EQUAL' otherwise.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of cards (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), r is a string representing the red digits on the cards (length of r is n, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), and b is a string representing the blue digits on the cards (length of b is n, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).
def func_4():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_3()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `T` is greater than 0, `func_3()` has been called `T` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_3()` which is expected to compare the strings `r` and `b` representing red and blue digits on cards, respectively. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value explicitly. However, the state of the program indicates that `func_3()` has been called `T` times, where `T` is the number of test cases. Potential edge cases include when `T` is 0 (no test cases to process), or when `r` and `b` have different lengths (though the annotation mentions lengths are between 1 and 1000, this should still be considered). Additionally, if `func_3()` is not defined or does not handle the comparison correctly, those functionalities are missing from the current description.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
