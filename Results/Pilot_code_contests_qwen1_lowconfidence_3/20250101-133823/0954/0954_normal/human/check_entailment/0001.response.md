Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where all digits in both strings are the same, leading to a tie (R = B). According to the problem description, if R = B, the result is a draw, and neither player wins. However, the current implementation will incorrectly print "RED" or "BLUE" in these cases.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
3
000
000
3
314
314
5
09281
09281
```

The expected output should be:
```
EQUAL
EQUAL
EQUAL
```

However, the current implementation will output:
```
RED
RED
EQUAL
```

This is because the program only compares the counts of `first` and `second` but does not account for the case where R and B are equal. To fix this, you need to ensure that if the counts are equal, the output should be "EQUAL". Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_3():
    a = int(input())
    b = input()
    c = input()
    first = 0
    second = 0
    for i in range(a):
        if int(b[i]) > int(c[i]):
            first += 1
        elif int(b[i]) < int(c[i]):
            second += 1
    if first > second:
        print('RED')
    elif second > first:
        print('BLUE')
    else:
        print('EQUAL')
```

With this correction, the program should handle all cases correctly.
