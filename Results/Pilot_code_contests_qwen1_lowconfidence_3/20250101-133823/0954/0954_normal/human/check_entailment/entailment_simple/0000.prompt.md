You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are n cards numbered 1, …, n. The card i has a red digit r_i and a blue digit b_i written on it.

We arrange all n cards in random order from left to right, with all permutations of 1, …, n having the same probability. We then read all red digits on the cards from left to right, and obtain an integer R. In the same way, we read all blue digits and obtain an integer B. When reading a number, leading zeros can be ignored. If all digits in a number are zeros, then the number is equal to 0. Below is an illustration of a possible rearrangement of three cards, and how R and B can be found.

<image>

Two players, Red and Blue, are involved in a bet. Red bets that after the shuffle R > B, and Blue bets that R < B. If in the end R = B, the bet results in a draw, and neither player wins.

Determine, which of the two players is more likely (has higher probability) to win the bet, or that their chances are equal. Refer to the Note section for a formal discussion of comparing probabilities.

Input

The first line contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

Descriptions of T test cases follow. Each test case description starts with a line containing a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of cards.

The following line contains a string of n digits r_1, …, r_n — red digits on cards 1, …, n respectively.

The following line contains a string of n digits b_1, …, b_n — blue digits on cards 1, …, n respectively.

Note that digits in the same line are not separated with any delimiters.

Output

Print T answers for the test cases in order, one per line.

If Red has a strictly higher change to win, print "RED".

If Blue has a strictly higher change to win, print "BLUE".

If both players are equally likely to win, print "EQUAL".

Note that all answers are case-sensitive.

Example

Input


3
3
777
111
3
314
159
5
09281
09281


Output


RED
BLUE
EQUAL

Note

Formally, let n_R be the number of permutations of cards 1, …, n such that the resulting numbers R and B satisfy R > B. Similarly, let n_B be the number of permutations such that R < B. If n_R > n_B, you should print "RED". If n_R < n_B, you should print "BLUE". If n_R = n_B, print "EQUAL".

In the first sample case, R = 777 and B = 111 regardless of the card order, thus Red always wins.

In the second sample case, there are two card orders when Red wins, and four card orders when Blue wins:

  * order 1, 2, 3: 314 > 159;
  * order 1, 3, 2: 341 > 195;
  * order 2, 1, 3: 134 < 519;
  * order 2, 3, 1: 143 < 591;
  * order 3, 1, 2: 431 < 915;
  * order 3, 2, 1: 413 < 951.



Since R < B is more frequent, the answer is "BLUE".

In the third sample case, R = B regardless of the card order, thus the bet is always a draw, and both Red and Blue have zero chance to win.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
import sys, math, bisect, itertools

input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_4()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the provided function `func_1()` are present in the function signature, so there are no specific conditions or descriptions about the variables' values. However, the function reads input and splits it into a list of integers.
def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that are the result of converting each element from a space-separated string input into an integer

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The variable T is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is an integer representing the number of cards, followed by two strings of digits representing the red and blue digits on the cards respectively.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing two integers. The first integer represents the number of test cases, and the second integer represents the number of cards for the current test case.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of cards (1 <= a <= 1000), b is a string representing the red digits on the cards, and c is a string representing the blue digits on the cards. Each character in b and c is a digit (0-9) and represents the corresponding digit on the card.
def func_3():
    a = int(input())
    b = input()
    c = input()
    first = 0
    second = 0
    for i in range(a):
        if int(b[i]) > int(c[i]):
            first += 1
        elif int(b[i]) < int(c[i]):
            second += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` must be a positive integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string can be converted to an integer, `c` is a list of strings where each string can be converted to an integer, `first` is the count of indices where the integer value of `b[i]` is greater than the integer value of `c[i]`, and `second` is the count of indices where the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]`. If `a` is 0 or either `b` or `c` do not contain enough elements, the loop does not execute and `first` and `second` remain as their initial values of 0.
    if (first > second) :
        print('RED')
    else :
        if (second > first) :
            print('BLUE')
        else :
            print('EQUAL')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string can be converted to an integer, `c` is a list of strings where each string can be converted to an integer, `first` is the count of indices where the integer value of `b[i]` is greater than the integer value of `c[i]`, `second` is the count of indices where the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]`. If `second` is greater than `first`, the string 'BLUE' is printed to the console. Otherwise, the string 'EQUAL' is printed to the console.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string can be converted to an integer, `c` is a list of strings where each string can be converted to an integer, `first` is the count of indices where the integer value of `b[i]` is greater than the integer value of `c[i]`, and `second` is the count of indices where the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]`. If `first` is greater than `second`, the string 'RED' is printed. Otherwise, if `second` is greater than or equal to `first`, the string 'BLUE' or 'EQUAL' is printed based on the comparison.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of cards (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), r is a string representing the red digits on the cards (length of r is n, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), and b is a string representing the blue digits on the cards (length of b is n, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).
def func_4():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_3()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `T` is greater than 0, `func_3()` has been called `T` times.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
