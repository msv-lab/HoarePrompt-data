Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling**:
   - **func_1**: Reads a space-separated string of integers and converts them to a list of integers. This is used to parse the red and blue digit strings for a single test case.
   - **func_2**: Reads the number of test cases (`T`) and the number of cards (`n`) for the current test case. However, this function is not actually used in the program, and the relevant parsing logic is directly handled in the main loop of `func_4`.
   - **func_3**: This is the core function that processes each test case. It compares the red and blue digits for each card and counts the number of positions where the red digit is greater than the blue digit (`first`), and the number of positions where the red digit is less than the blue digit (`second`). Based on these counts, it prints "RED", "BLUE", or "EQUAL" accordingly.

2. **Main Function (func_4)**:
   - It iterates over the number of test cases (`T`) and calls `func_3` for each test case.
   - The logic within `func_3` ensures that for each test case, the correct comparison is made between the red and blue digits across all cards, and the appropriate output is generated based on the counts of where the red digit is greater or less than the blue digit.

3. **Comparison Logic**:
   - The program correctly handles all scenarios described in the problem statement:
     - If `first > second`, it prints "RED".
     - If `second > first`, it prints "BLUE".
     - If `first == second`, it prints "EQUAL".

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The program assumes that the input is well-formed and valid, as stated in the problem description. It does not include error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values, incorrect number of test cases or cards).

Given that the program follows the problem description accurately, including all necessary comparisons and outputs, the correctness of the program is **True**.
