Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the probability of Red or Blue winning the bet. The function `func_3()` compares the digits at each index of the two strings `b` and `c` and counts how many times the digit in `b` is greater than, less than, or equal to the corresponding digit in `c`. However, this approach does not account for the permutations of the cards, which is essential for determining the probability of `R > B` or `R < B`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
123
321
```
The function `func_3()` would simply compare the digits at each index, resulting in `first = 1` and `second = 1`, and print `EQUAL`. However, there are six possible permutations of the cards (123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321), and only one permutation (321) results in `R > B` (3 > 1). Thus, the probability of `R > B` is 1/6, while the probability of `R < B` is 1/2. Therefore, Blue has a higher chance of winning, and the correct output should be `BLUE`.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider all permutations of the cards and count the number of permutations where `R > B` and `R < B`. This involves generating all permutations of the digits and calculating the resulting `R` and `B` for each permutation.
