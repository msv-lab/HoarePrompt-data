Final: **True**

Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment was incorrect. The annotated version clearly shows that the function `func_3()` now properly handles the case where `first` equals `second`, printing "EQUAL" in such cases. This is evident from the final if-else block in `func_3()`:

```python
if (first > second) :
    print('RED')
else :
    if (second > first) :
        print('BLUE')
    else :
        print('EQUAL')
```

This ensures that if the counts of `first` and `second` are equal, the program correctly prints "EQUAL". Therefore, the program now meets the requirements specified in the problem description and the original assessment of **False** is no longer accurate.
