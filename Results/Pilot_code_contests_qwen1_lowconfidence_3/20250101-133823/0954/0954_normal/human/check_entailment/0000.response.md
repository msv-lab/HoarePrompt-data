Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not properly simulate all possible permutations of card orders to calculate the probabilities of `R > B`, `R < B`, and `R = B`. Instead, it only compares the digits at the same positions in the red and blue digit strings, which does not account for all permutations of card orders.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to generate all possible permutations of card orders and count the number of permutations where `R > B`, `R < B`, and `R = B`. The given program only checks the first digit comparison, which is insufficient to determine the overall probabilities. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
