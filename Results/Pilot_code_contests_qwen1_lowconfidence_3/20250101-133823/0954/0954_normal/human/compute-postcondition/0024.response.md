Postcondition: ***`a` must be a positive integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string can be converted to an integer, `c` is a list of strings where each string can be converted to an integer, `first` is the count of indices where the integer value of `b[i]` is greater than the integer value of `c[i]`, and `second` is the count of indices where the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]`. `first` is greater than `second`.***
