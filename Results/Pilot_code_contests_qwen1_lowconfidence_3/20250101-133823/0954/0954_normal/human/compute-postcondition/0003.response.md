The function `func_3()` is called but its implementation is not provided. Therefore, the exact changes to the variables cannot be determined. The only information we know is that the value of `T` is greater than 0 before the function call. After calling `func_3()`, the value of `T` remains greater than 0 unless `func_3()` explicitly changes it.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0**
