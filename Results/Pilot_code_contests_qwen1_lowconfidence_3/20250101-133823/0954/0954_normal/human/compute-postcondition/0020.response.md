`second` is incremented by 1, changing its value from whatever it was previously to `second + 1`. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, `first`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` must be greater than `i + 1`, `b` is a list of strings, `c` is a list of strings, `first` remains as it is, `second` is `second + 1`**
