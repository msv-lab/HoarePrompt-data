The code `print('EQUAL')` simply prints the string 'EQUAL' to the console. It does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `first`, and `second` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string can be converted to an integer, `c` is a list of strings where each string can be converted to an integer, `first` is the count of indices where the integer value of `b[i]` is greater than the integer value of `c[i]`, `second` is the count of indices where the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]`, and `first` is greater than or equal to `second`. The string 'EQUAL' is printed to the console.**
