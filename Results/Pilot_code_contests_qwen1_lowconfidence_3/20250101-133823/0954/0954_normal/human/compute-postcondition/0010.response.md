`second` is incremented by 1. The conditions that `a` must be greater than 0 and the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` must be greater than 0; the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]`; `second` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0; the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]`; `second` is increased by 1**
