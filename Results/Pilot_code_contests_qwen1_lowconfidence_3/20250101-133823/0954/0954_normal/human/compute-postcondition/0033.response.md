The function `func_3` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. `a` is an integer representing the number of cards, with the constraint that \(1 \leq a \leq 1000\). `b` is a string representing the red digits on the cards, and `c` is a string representing the blue digits on the cards. Each character in `b` and `c` is a digit (0-9) and represents the corresponding digit on the card.

Based on the provided information, the function returns different outputs based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, since the specific conditions for returning values are not detailed, we can summarize the parameters and their constraints without specifying the exact return values.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept an integer `a` within the range of 1 to 1000, and two strings `b` and `c` representing digits on cards.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `a` (1 <= a <= 1000), and two strings `b` and `c` representing digits on cards.**
