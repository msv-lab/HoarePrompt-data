Postcondition: ***`a` must be greater than 0, `b` is a list of strings, `c` is a list of strings, `first` is updated based on the comparison of `b[i+1]` and `c[i+1]`. If `int(b[i]) > int(c[i])`, `first` is incremented by 1. If `int(b[i]) < int(c[i])`, `second` is incremented by 1. If `int(b[i]) == int(c[i])`, the values of `first` and `second` remain unchanged.***
