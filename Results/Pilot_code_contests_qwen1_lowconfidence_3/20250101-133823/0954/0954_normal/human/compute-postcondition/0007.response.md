The function `func_4` accepts four parameters: `T`, `n`, `r`, and `b`. `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of cards (with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `r` is a string representing the red digits on the cards (with the constraint length of `r` is `n`, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), and `b` is a string representing the blue digits on the cards (with the constraint length of `b` is `n`, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000). 

Given the constraints and the nature of the parameters, the function will process multiple test cases (`T`) where for each test case, it will compare the strings `r` and `b` which represent the red and blue digits on the cards, respectively. However, the specific output based on the comparison is not detailed in the provided information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept parameters `T`, `n`, `r`, and `b`, and for each test case, perform some operation based on comparing the strings `r` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `T`, `n`, `r`, and `b`. For each test case, it processes the strings `r` and `b` and returns a result based on their comparison.**
