Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `a` (1 <= a <= 1000), and two strings `b` and `c` representing digits on cards. It compares the digits at each index of the two strings and counts how many times the digit in `b` is greater than, less than, or equal to the corresponding digit in `c`. After comparing all digits, it prints 'RED' if the count of digits in `b` being greater than those in `c` is more than the count of digits in `b` being less than those in `c`, prints 'BLUE' if the count of digits in `b` being less than those in `c` is more than the count of digits in `b` being greater than those in `c`, and prints 'EQUAL' otherwise.**

Edge Cases:
- If `a` is 0, the function will not enter the for loop and will directly print 'EQUAL'.
- If the lengths of `b` and `c` are not equal, the function will only compare up to the length of the shorter string. This could lead to incorrect results if `a` is not equal to the length of both `b` and `c`. However, the function does not check for this condition, so it should be noted that the function may produce incorrect results if the inputs are not of equal length and `a` is not zero.
