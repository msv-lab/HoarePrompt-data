Postcondition: ***`a` must be greater than 0, `b` is a list of strings, `c` is a list of strings, `first` is updated based on the comparison of `b[i+1]` and `c[i+1]`, and `second` is increased by 1 if `int(b[i]) < int(c[i])`. If the condition `int(b[i]) < int(c[i])` is false, the values of `first` and `second` remain unchanged.***
