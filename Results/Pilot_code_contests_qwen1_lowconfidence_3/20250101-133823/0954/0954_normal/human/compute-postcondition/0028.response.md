The code `print('BLUE')` prints the string 'BLUE' to the console but does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `first`, `second`, and the condition that `second` is greater than `first` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string can be converted to an integer, `c` is a list of strings where each string can be converted to an integer, `first` is the count of indices where the integer value of `b[i]` is greater than the integer value of `c[i]`, `second` is the count of indices where the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]`, and `second` is greater than `first`, and 'BLUE' is printed to the console.**
