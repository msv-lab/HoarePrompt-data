Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string can be converted to an integer, `c` is a list of strings where each string can be converted to an integer, `first` is the count of indices where the integer value of `b[i]` is greater than the integer value of `c[i]`, `second` is the count of indices where the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]`. If `second` is greater than `first`, the string 'BLUE' is printed to the console. Otherwise, the string 'EQUAL' is printed to the console.***
