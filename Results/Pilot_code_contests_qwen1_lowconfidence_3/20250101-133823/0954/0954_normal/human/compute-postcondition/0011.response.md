Postcondition: ***`a` must be greater than 0, and the integer value of `b[i]` is less than or equal to the integer value of `c[i]`. If the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]`, `second` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no change is made to the conditions specified in the precondition.***
