Postcondition: ***`a` must be greater than 0, `b` is a list of strings, `c` is a list of strings, `first` is increased by 1 if the integer value of `b[i]` is greater than the integer value of `c[i]`, and `second` is increased by 1 if the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to these conditions.***
