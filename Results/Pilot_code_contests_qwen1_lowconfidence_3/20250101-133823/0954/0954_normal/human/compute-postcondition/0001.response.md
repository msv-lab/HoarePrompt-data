The code snippet provided is `func_3()`. Since there is no definition given for `func_3()` in the initial state or within the snippet itself, we cannot determine what changes, if any, this function might make to the variables. Therefore, the only thing we know for certain is that `T` remains greater than 0 because the initial state specifies this.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0**
