Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `func_3()` has been called `T` times.**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
   - `n` is an integer representing the number of cards (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).
   - `r` is a string representing the red digits on the cards (length of `r` is `n`, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000).
   - `b` is a string representing the blue digits on the cards (length of `b` is `n`, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for `int(input())` times, which means the user inputs the number of times they want the loop to execute.
   - Inside the loop, the function `func_3()` is called each time the loop iterates.

3. **Output State Analysis**:
   - After the loop executes 1 time, `T` must be greater than 0.
   - After the loop executes 2 times, `T` must still be greater than 0.
   - After the loop executes 3 times, `T` must still be greater than 0.
   
4. **Generalization**:
   - Since the loop continues to execute as long as `T` is greater than 0, the final output state will be that `T` must be greater than 0.
   - Additionally, since `func_3()` is called in each iteration, the number of calls to `func_3()` will be equal to the final value of `T`.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is that `T` is greater than 0, and `func_3()` has been called `T` times.
