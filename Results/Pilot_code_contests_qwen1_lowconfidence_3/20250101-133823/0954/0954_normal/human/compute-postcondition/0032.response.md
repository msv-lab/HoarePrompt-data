Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string can be converted to an integer, `c` is a list of strings where each string can be converted to an integer, `first` is the count of indices where the integer value of `b[i]` is greater than the integer value of `c[i]`, and `second` is the count of indices where the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]`. If `first` is greater than `second`, the string 'RED' is printed. Otherwise, if `second` is greater than or equal to `first`, the string 'BLUE' or 'EQUAL' is printed based on the comparison.***
