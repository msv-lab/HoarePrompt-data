The code initializes `ans` to an empty string. This does not affect the values of `n`, `l`, or `s`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, `l` is an integer provided by the user, `s` is a list of `n` strings provided by the user and sorted in ascending order, `ans` is an empty string**
