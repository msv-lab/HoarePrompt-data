The code `n, l = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two space-separated integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `l`. The initial state specifies that `N` and `L` are positive integers between 1 and 100, but the code does not assign specific values to `N` and `L`; instead, it expects the user to input values for `n` and `l`.

After executing the code, the variables `n` and `l` will hold the integer values provided by the user. The initial values of `N` and `L` are no longer relevant.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, `l` is an integer provided by the user**
