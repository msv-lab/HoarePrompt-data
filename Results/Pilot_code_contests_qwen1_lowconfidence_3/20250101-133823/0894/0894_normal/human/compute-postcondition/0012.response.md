The function `func` accepts no parameters. The parameter constraints and relationships are given but do not appear within the function definition. The function does not take any arguments based on the provided code snippet.

Given the output cases are not directly tied to any input parameters within the function body itself, we can infer that the function might process some internal data or state that is not shown in the provided code snippet.

Since the function definition itself does not include any parameters, the functionality can be described as follows:
