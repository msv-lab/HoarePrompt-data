The code `s = [raw_input() for _ in xrange(n)]` creates a list `s` by iterating `n` times and taking user input each time. However, since `raw_input()` reads a line from input, the type of elements in `s` will be strings, not integers, and the actual values will be the strings provided by the user.

Given the initial state where `n` is an integer provided by the user and `l` is an integer provided by the user, the code does not affect the value of `l`. It only assigns a list of strings (user inputs) to `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, `l` is an integer provided by the user, `s` is a list of `n` strings provided by the user**
