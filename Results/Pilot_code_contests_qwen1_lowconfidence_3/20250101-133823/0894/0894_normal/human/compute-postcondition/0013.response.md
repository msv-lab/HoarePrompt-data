Functionality: **The function reads two integers `n` and `l` from standard input, where `n` represents the number of strings and `l` is a parameter related to the strings' length. It then reads `n` strings of length `l` each and stores them in a list `s`. After sorting the list `s` in ascending order, the function concatenates all strings in the list into a single string `ans`. Finally, the function prints the concatenated string `ans`. Potential edge cases include when `n` or `l` are out of the specified range (1 to 100). If the input does not conform to these constraints, the behavior is undefined. Missing functionality is that the function does not validate the input `n` and `l` to ensure they are within the specified range.**
