The code `ans += s[i]` appends the `(i+1)`-th element of `s` to the end of the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is `i + 1`, which means `i` starts from the second index (since indexing starts from 0). Given that `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in ascending order, and `i` is `i + 1`, the value of `i` starts from 1.

Let's break it down:

1. The initial value of `ans` is the concatenation of the first and second elements of `s`.
2. The value of `i` is `i + 1`, starting from 1.
3. The code `ans += s[i]` appends the second element of `s` to `ans`.

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` will be the concatenation of the first, second, and second elements of `s`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `l` is an integer provided by the user, `s` is a list of `n` strings provided by the user and sorted in ascending order, `ans` is a string containing the first, second, and second elements of `s` concatenated, `i` is `i + 1` starting from 1**
