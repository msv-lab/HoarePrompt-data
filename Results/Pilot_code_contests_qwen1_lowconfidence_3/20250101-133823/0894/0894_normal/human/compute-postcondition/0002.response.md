`s.sort()` sorts the list `s` in ascending order. The sorting operation does not affect the values of `n` or `l`, but it changes the order of elements in the list `s`. Since the initial state mentions that `s` is a list of `n` strings provided by the user, after sorting, `s` will be a list of those same strings but now sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, `l` is an integer provided by the user, `s` is a list of `n` strings provided by the user and sorted in ascending order**
