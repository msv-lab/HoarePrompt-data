The code `print(ans)` will print the value of the variable `ans`, which currently contains all elements of the list `s` concatenated together. The value of `ans` will remain unchanged after the print statement executes. The states of the other variables (`n`, `l`, and `s`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an integer provided by the user, `s` is a list of `n` strings provided by the user and sorted in ascending order, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `s` concatenated together, `ans` is printed**
