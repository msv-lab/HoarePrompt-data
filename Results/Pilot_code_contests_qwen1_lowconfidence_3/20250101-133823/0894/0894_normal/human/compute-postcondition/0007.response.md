`ans` is updated by appending the `(i+1)`-th element of `s` to itself. Since `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in ascending order, and `ans` was initially a string containing the `(i+1)`-th element of `s`, after executing `ans += s[i]`, `ans` will now contain the original `(i+1)`-th element followed by the `(i+1)`-th element again.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `l` is an integer provided by the user, `s` is a list of `n` strings provided by the user and sorted in ascending order, `ans` is a string containing the `(i+1)`-th element of `s` followed by the `(i+1)`-th element of `s`.**
