Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the input values `n` and `l` are out of the specified range (1 to 100). According to the problem description, the constraints specify that `1 ≦ N, L ≦ 100`, but the code does not perform any checks to ensure that these constraints are met. Therefore, if `n` or `l` are outside this range, the program may produce incorrect results or exhibit undefined behavior. This violates the requirement that the program should work correctly for every potential case within the given constraints.
