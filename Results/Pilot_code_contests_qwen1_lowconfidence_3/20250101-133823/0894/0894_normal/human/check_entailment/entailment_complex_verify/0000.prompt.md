You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Iroha has a sequence of N strings S_1, S_2, ..., S_N. The length of each string is L.

She will concatenate all of the strings in some order, to produce a long string.

Among all strings that she can produce in this way, find the lexicographically smallest one.

Here, a string s=s_1s_2s_3...s_n is lexicographically smaller than another string t=t_1t_2t_3...t_m if and only if one of the following holds:

* There exists an index i(1≦i≦min(n,m)), such that s_j = t_j for all indices j(1≦j<i), and s_i<t_i.
* s_i = t_i for all integers i(1≦i≦min(n,m)), and n<m.

Constraints

* 1 ≦ N, L ≦ 100
* For each i, the length of S_i equals L.
* For each i, S_i consists of lowercase letters.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N L
S_1
S_2
:
S_N


Output

Print the lexicographically smallest string that Iroha can produce.

Example

Input

3 3
dxx
axx
cxx


Output

axxcxxdxx
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, l) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    s = [raw_input() for _ in xrange(n)]
    s.sort()
    ans = ''
    for i in xrange(n):
        ans += s[i]
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly concatenate the strings to form the lexicographically smallest string. The issue lies in the sorting step. When sorting the list of strings `s`, it performs a lexicographical sort, which is not sufficient to guarantee the lexicographically smallest concatenated string for all possible inputs. 

For instance, consider the following input:

```
4 3
abc
cba
bac
cab
```

The expected output should be `"abcabcabc"`, but the current implementation will output `"cbaabcabc"` because the list is sorted lexicographically, not considering the final concatenated result.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the strings are ordered in a way that minimizes the lexicographical order of the concatenated result. One way to achieve this is to reverse the strings before sorting and then reverse them back after concatenation. Here's the corrected approach:

```python
def func():
    (n, l) = map(int, input().split())
    s = [input() for _ in range(n)]
    # Reverse each string before sorting
    s = [s_i[::-1] for s_i in s]
    s.sort()
    # Reverse each string back to its original order
    s = [s_i[::-1] for s_i in s]
    ans = ''.join(s)
    print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected approach ensures that the lexicographically smallest string is formed when the strings are concatenated.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and L are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N, L ≤ 100. Each S_i is a string of length L consisting of lowercase letters.
def func():
    n, l = map(int, raw_input().split())
    s = [raw_input() for _ in xrange(n)]
    s.sort()
    ans = ''
    for i in xrange(n):
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is an integer provided by the user, `s` is a list of `n` strings provided by the user and sorted in ascending order, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `s` concatenated together.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `n` and `l` from standard input, where `n` represents the number of strings and `l` is a parameter related to the strings' length. It then reads `n` strings of length `l` each and stores them in a list `s`. After sorting the list `s` in ascending order, the function concatenates all strings in the list into a single string `ans`. Finally, the function prints the concatenated string `ans`. Potential edge cases include when `n` or `l` are out of the specified range (1 to 100). If the input does not conform to these constraints, the behavior is undefined. Missing functionality is that the function does not validate the input `n` and `l` to ensure they are within the specified range.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
