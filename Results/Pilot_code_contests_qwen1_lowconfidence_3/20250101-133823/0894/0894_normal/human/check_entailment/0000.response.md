Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly concatenate the strings to form the lexicographically smallest string. The issue lies in the sorting step. When sorting the list of strings `s`, it performs a lexicographical sort, which is not sufficient to guarantee the lexicographically smallest concatenated string for all possible inputs. 

For instance, consider the following input:

```
4 3
abc
cba
bac
cab
```

The expected output should be `"abcabcabc"`, but the current implementation will output `"cbaabcabc"` because the list is sorted lexicographically, not considering the final concatenated result.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the strings are ordered in a way that minimizes the lexicographical order of the concatenated result. One way to achieve this is to reverse the strings before sorting and then reverse them back after concatenation. Here's the corrected approach:

```python
def func():
    (n, l) = map(int, input().split())
    s = [input() for _ in range(n)]
    # Reverse each string before sorting
    s = [s_i[::-1] for s_i in s]
    s.sort()
    # Reverse each string back to its original order
    s = [s_i[::-1] for s_i in s]
    ans = ''.join(s)
    print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected approach ensures that the lexicographically smallest string is formed when the strings are concatenated.
