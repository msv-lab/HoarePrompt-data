Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it simply concatenates the strings in the order they appear after sorting them lexicographically, rather than considering all possible permutations to find the lexicographically smallest string. The problem requires finding the smallest possible string by concatenating the strings in any order, not just the first lexicographic permutation.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should generate all possible permutations of the strings and then concatenate them to find the lexicographically smallest string. However, due to the constraints (with \( N \leq 100 \) and \( L \leq 100 \)), generating all permutations and checking each one is feasible.

Here's a brief outline of how the corrected program could work:
1. Read the input values \( N \) and \( L \).
2. Read and store the \( N \) strings.
3. Generate all possible permutations of the \( N \) strings.
4. Concatenate each permutation and compare to find the lexicographically smallest string.
5. Print the smallest string found.

Since the current program only sorts the strings and concatenates them in that order, it does not satisfy the requirement to consider all permutations, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
