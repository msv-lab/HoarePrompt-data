The function `func_17` accepts an integer `n` as a parameter and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3. It returns `False` for all other values of `n`. Specifically:
- If `n` is less than 2, it returns `False`.
- If `n` is 2 or 3, it returns `True`.
- If `n` is even or divisible by 3, it returns `False`.
- For larger values of `n`, it checks divisibility starting from 5 up to the square root of `n`, incrementing by 6 each time, to find any factors of the form `i` or `i + 2`. If such a factor is found, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

Potential edge cases:
- For `n < 2`, the function correctly returns `False`.
- For `n = 2` or `n = 3`, the function correctly returns `True`.
- For even numbers or multiples of 3, the function correctly returns `False`.
- For larger numbers, the function uses an optimized trial division method, checking only up to the square root of `n` and skipping multiples of 2 and 3, which ensures efficiency while still being correct for prime checking.

Missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `n` is an integer, but there is no validation to ensure this. If `n` is not an integer, the behavior is undefined.
- While the function is designed to efficiently check for primes, it does not handle very large integers optimally due to the square root calculation.
