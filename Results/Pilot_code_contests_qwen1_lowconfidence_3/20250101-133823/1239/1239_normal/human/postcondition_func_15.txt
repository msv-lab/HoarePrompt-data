The function `func_16` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function repeatedly updates `x` and `y` such that `x` becomes `y` and `y` becomes `x % y` until `y` is 0. At this point, the function returns `x`, which is the GCD of the initial values of `x` and `y`. The function handles the edge case where `y` is already 0, returning `x` directly without further computation.
