The function `func_8` accepts a single parameter `l`, which is expected to be a list containing exactly two integers `[a, b]` where `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`. It returns a new list that is a sorted version of `l` in descending order based on the result of applying the `getKey` function to each element. If `l` does not contain exactly two elements, the function will raise a `ValueError`. No other modifications are made to the input list; the function works on a copy of the input list. The function does not handle cases where `l` contains more than two elements or elements outside the specified range.
