The function `func_15` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`. It reduces `x` modulo `p` and sets `y` to 0. Then, it computes the modular exponentiation of `x` raised to the power of the original `y` value, modulo `p`, using an efficient algorithm known as exponentiation by squaring. The function returns the result of this computation.
