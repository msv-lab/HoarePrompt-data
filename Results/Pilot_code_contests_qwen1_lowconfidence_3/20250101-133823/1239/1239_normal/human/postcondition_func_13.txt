The function `func_14` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both integers with the condition that `1 <= y <= x` and `x > 0`. It returns the integer division of `x` by `y` if `x` is divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`). If `x` is not divisible by `y`, it returns the integer division of `x` by `y` plus one (`x // y + 1`). This ensures that the returned value is always greater than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `y`.
