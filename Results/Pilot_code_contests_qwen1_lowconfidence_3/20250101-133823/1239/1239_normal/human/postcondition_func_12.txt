The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r` with the constraint 0 <= r <= n. It returns the result of the expression `factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))`. This expression calculates the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose `r` elements from a set of `n` elements without regard to the order of selection. The function handles the case where `r` could be 0 or `n`, ensuring that `max(n - r, 1)` avoids division by zero when `r` equals `n`. No additional edge cases or missing functionality are present in the given code.
