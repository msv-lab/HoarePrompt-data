The function `func_10` accepts a non-negative integer `x`. It returns `True` if `x` is 0 and `False` if `x` is any other non-zero non-negative integer. The function leverages the bitwise operation `x & (x - 1)` to check if `x` is a power of two. If `x` is a power of two, `x & (x - 1)` equals zero, which would result in `not x` being `True`. However, the given code does not correctly implement this logic; instead, it directly uses `return x and not x & x - 1`, which simplifies to `return x and x == 1` due to the properties of the bitwise AND operation. This means the function will return `True` only if `x` is exactly 1 and `False` otherwise. An edge case to consider is when `x` is 0, which should also return `True`, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly. Therefore, the function should be revised to correctly handle the edge case where `x` is 0.
