Postcondition: **`args` must contain at least one element, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or a single space `' '`, `file` is either the value of `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False` if the condition `not at_start` is true, and the file now contains the value of `sep` if the condition `not at_start` is true.**
