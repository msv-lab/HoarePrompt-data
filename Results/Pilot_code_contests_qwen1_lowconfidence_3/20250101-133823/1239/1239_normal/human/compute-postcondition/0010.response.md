`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. Since `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or a single space `' '`, and `file` now contains the original content plus `str(x)`, the new content in `file` will be the original content followed by `sep`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `args` must contain at least two elements, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\), `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or a single space `' '`, `file` now contains the original content plus `sep`, `at_start` is `False`.
