The `continue` statement in a loop causes the loop to skip the rest of its body and move on to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not indicate which loop the `continue` statement is in, nor does it affect any variables outside of the loop. Therefore, the values of `ans`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the 2nd bit of `x` and `y`, no change in variables due to `continue`.**
