Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial States:**
   - `func_1()` returns a positive integer.
   - `ans` is the sum of all positions `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to 31) such that `(x & 1 << i) and (y & 1 << i)` or `(not x & 1 << i) and (not y & 1 << i)` is true.
   - `i` is 31.
   - `i` must be less than 32.
   - `func_20(ans)` is called.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop `for _ in range(func_1()):` will execute based on the value returned by `func_1()`.
   - Let's denote the number of iterations as `num_iterations`.

3. **Analyze the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 31.
   - `i` must be less than 32.
   - `func_1()` returns a positive integer, meaning there are at least one more iteration to execute.

4. **Adjust the States for Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is 31, it will increment to 0 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be set to 0.
   - The value of `ans` remains unchanged since the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to `ans`.
   - The condition `i < 32` must still hold true.

5. **Construct the New State:**
   - `func_1()` will return a positive integer, indicating at least one more iteration.
   - `ans` remains the same.
   - `i` is reset to 0.
   - `i` must still be less than 32.

Therefore, the new state for the next iteration is:
State: **`func_1()` returns a positive integer, `ans` is the sum of all positions `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to 31) such that `(x & 1 << i) and (y & 1 << i)` or `(not x & 1 << i) and (not y & 1 << i)` is true, `i` is 0, and `i` must be less than 32.**
