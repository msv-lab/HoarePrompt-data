The `continue` statement in this context does not change any variable values but instead skips to the next iteration of a loop (if there was one). Since there is no loop to exit or iterate through, the only effect is that the current execution of whatever block the `continue` statement is in is skipped.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on the i-th bit of `x` and `y`.
- `i` is 1.
- `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`.

Since the `continue` statement does not alter any variable values, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on the i-th bit of `x` and `y`, `i` is 1, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`**
