`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. The initial state does not specify what `x` is, but it implies that `x` must be defined and is an object that can be converted to a string. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least two elements, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\), `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or a single space `' '`, `file` now contains its original content plus the string representation of `x`, `at_start` is `False`**
