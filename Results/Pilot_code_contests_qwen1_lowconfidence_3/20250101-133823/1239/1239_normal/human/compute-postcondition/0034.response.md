`ans` is incremented by `1 << i`. Here, `i` is 3, so `1 << 3` equals 8 (since shifting 1 left by 3 positions gives `1000` in binary). The value of `ans` before the operation is 0, 1, or 2. Adding 8 to any of these values will result in a new value for `ans`.

Given the initial state, `ans` can be 0, 1, or 2. After the operation, the value of `ans` will be 8 more than its initial value.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `i` must be less than 32, `func_1()` returns a positive integer, `ans` is 8, 9, or 10 depending on the initial value of `ans` (0, 1, or 2)**
