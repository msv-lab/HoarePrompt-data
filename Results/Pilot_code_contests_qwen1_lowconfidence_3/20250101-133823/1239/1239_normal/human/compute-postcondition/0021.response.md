Postcondition: `args` is an empty list or a list containing all the elements that were written to `file`, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\), `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or a single space `' '`, `file` contains the original content plus the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, `at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys `'end'` and `'flush'`, and the value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`.
