State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `i` must be less than 32**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Values**: The initial state provides that `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, and `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is defined by `range(32)`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i < 32`.

3. **Adjusting States**: For the loop to execute, the initial value of `i` (which is 0) must satisfy the loop condition `i < 32`. Since `i` starts at 0, it is less than 32, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

4. **Other Variables**: The values of `ans`, `i`, `x`, and `y` do not affect the ability of the loop to execute based on the given condition. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for `ans`, `x`, or `y`.

5. **Conclusion**: The only state that needs to be ensured for the loop to execute is that `i` must be less than 32, which is already satisfied with `i` starting at 0.

Thus, the required state is: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `i` must be less than 32**.
