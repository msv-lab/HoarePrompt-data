Postcondition: ***`args` must contain at least one element, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\), `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or a single space `' '`, `file` now contains its original content plus the string representation of `sep`, `at_start` is `False`***

Explanation: Since the if condition `not at_start` is true (as `at_start` is `False`), the if part is executed. The postcondition of the if part matches the postcondition we need to state, which means `file` now contains its original content plus the string representation of `sep`. Therefore, the overall postcondition remains the same as the postcondition of the if part, as there is no else part to consider.
