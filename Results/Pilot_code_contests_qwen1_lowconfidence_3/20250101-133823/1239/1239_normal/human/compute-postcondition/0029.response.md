The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the execution simply moves to the next line without changing any variables.

Given the initial state:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is 1 and `i` must be less than 32
- `func_1()` returns a positive integer
- `ans` is 0 or 1 depending on the bitwise AND of `x` with \(1\) left-shifted by 1 and `y` with \(1\) left-shifted by 1, or both are false
- `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`

Since `continue` does not affect any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1 and `i` must be less than 32, `func_1()` returns a positive integer, `ans` is 0 or 1 depending on the bitwise AND of `x` with \(1\) left-shifted by 1 and `y` with \(1\) left-shifted by 1, or both are false, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`**
