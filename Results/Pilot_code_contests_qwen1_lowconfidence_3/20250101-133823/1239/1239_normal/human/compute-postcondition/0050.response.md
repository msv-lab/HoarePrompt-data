Postcondition: ***`ans` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the i-th (which is 1) bit of `x` and `y`. If both the i-th bit of `x` and `y` is 1 or both is 0, then `ans` remains as it was before the if-else block. Otherwise, `ans` is either 2 or 3.***

Explanation: 
- The if condition checks if both the i-th bit of `x` and `y` is 1 or both is 0.
- If the condition is true, `ans` remains unchanged.
- If the condition is false, `ans` is set to either 2 or 3, which is covered in the else part.
