Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `i` must be less than 32, `func_1()` returns a positive integer, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the bitwise conditions involving `x` and `y` as returned by `func_3()`: if both `x & 1 << i` and `y & 1 << i` are true, `ans` is 1; if both are false, `ans` is 2; otherwise, `ans` is 0.***
