The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, the provided code does not include a loop, so the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the overall state. The variables `ans`, `i`, `x`, and `y` retain their previous values.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `i` must be less than 32. The current value of `(x & 1 << i)` and `(y & 1 << i)` satisfies the condition `(x & 1 << i and y & 1 << i) or (not x & 1 << i and not y & 1 << i)`**
