Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `i` must be less than 32
   - `func_1()` returns a positive integer
   - `ans` is 0 or 1 depending on the bitwise AND of `x` with \(1\) left-shifted by `i` and `y` with \(1\) left-shifted by `i`
   - `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < 32`.

3. **Incrementing `i`**: Since the loop is iterating over `range(32)`, at the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **New State Calculation**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - Therefore, `i` must now be 1.
   - The condition `i < 32` still holds true since 1 is less than 32.

5. **Other States**: 
   - `total` remains unchanged at 0.
   - `func_1()` returns a positive integer, so this remains unchanged.
   - `ans` is determined by the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `y` shifted left by `i` (which is now 1). This value will be recalculated based on the new `i` but does not affect the state condition for the loop itself.

Based on the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `i` must be less than 32, `func_1()` returns a positive integer, `ans` is 0 or 1 depending on the bitwise AND of `x` with \(1\) left-shifted by 1 and `y` with \(1\) left-shifted by 1, or both are false, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`**.
