Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is 3, and `i` must be less than 32. `func_1()` returns a positive integer. If the bitwise conditions involving `x` and `y` as determined by `func_3()` result in `ans` being 0 or 1, then `ans` remains unchanged. If the bitwise conditions result in `ans` being 2, then `ans` is set to either 8, 9, or 10 depending on the initial value of `ans`.***
