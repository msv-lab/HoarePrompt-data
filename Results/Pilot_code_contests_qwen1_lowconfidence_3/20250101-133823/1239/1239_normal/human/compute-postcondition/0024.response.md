The function `func_20` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function processes integers `a` and `b` such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided information, but based on the structure, it likely returns results for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, processes integers `a` and `b` such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, but does not explicitly return any value.**
