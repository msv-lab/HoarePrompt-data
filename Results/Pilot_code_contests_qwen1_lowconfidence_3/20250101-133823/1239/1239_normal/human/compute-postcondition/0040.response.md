`ans` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `ans` is now explicitly set to `0`, and the other variables (`i`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their previous values. The function call `func_1()` and its return value are not directly referenced in the code snippet, but the fact that `func_1()` returns a positive integer indicating at least one more iteration is preserved.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`**
