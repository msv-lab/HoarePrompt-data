`ans` is incremented by `1 << i`. Since `i` is initially 1, `1 << i` equals `1 << 1`, which is 2. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `0 + 2`, which is 2.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged: `total` is 0, `i` is 2 (since `i` was incremented), `i` must still be less than 32, `func_1()` returns a positive integer, `ans` is now 2, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `i` must be less than 32, `func_1()` returns a positive integer, `ans` is 2, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`**
