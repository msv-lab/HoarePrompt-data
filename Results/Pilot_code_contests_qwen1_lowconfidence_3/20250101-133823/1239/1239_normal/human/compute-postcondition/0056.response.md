The function `func_20(ans)` is called with `ans` as an argument. The value of `ans` is the bitwise XOR of `x` and `y`, which are the values returned by `func_3()`. However, the code itself does not change any variables or return a new value; it simply calls a function with `ans` as an argument. The states of the other variables (`i`, `x`, and `y`) are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is the bitwise XOR of `x` and `y`, `i` is 32, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`.

Output State: **`ans` is the bitwise XOR of `x` and `y`, `i` is 32, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`**
