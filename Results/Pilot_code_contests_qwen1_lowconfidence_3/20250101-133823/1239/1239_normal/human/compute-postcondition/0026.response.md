The code increments `ans` by `1 << i`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and must be less than 32, `1 << i` evaluates to `1` because `1 << 0` equals 1. The condition `(x & 1 << i and y & 1 << i) or (not x & 1 << i and not y & 1 << i)` being false ensures that this operation can proceed without violating the given condition. Therefore, `ans` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `i` must be less than 32, `func_1()` returns a positive integer, `ans` is 1, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `(x & 1 << i and y & 1 << i) or (not x & 1 << i and not y & 1 << i)` is false**
