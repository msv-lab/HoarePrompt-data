The code `ans += 1 << i` shifts `1` left by `i` positions and adds this value to `ans`. Given the initial state where `ans` is `0`, `i` is `0`, and `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, the value of `1 << i` when `i` is `0` is `1`.

So, `ans` is updated to `ans + 1`, which means `ans` becomes `1`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is 1, `i` is 0, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `i` must be less than 32, and at least one of `x` and `y` has the i-th bit set or both do not have the i-th bit set**
