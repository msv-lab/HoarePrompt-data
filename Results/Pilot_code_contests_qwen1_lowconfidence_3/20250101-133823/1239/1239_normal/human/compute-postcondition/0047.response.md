According to the code, the loop iterates over `i` from 0 to 31. The loop body modifies the variable `ans` based on the i-th bit of `x` and `y`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `ans` is either 0 or 1, depending on the i-th bit of `x` and `y`.
- `i` is 0.
- `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `i` must be less than 32.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Since `i` must be less than 32 for the loop to continue, this condition is still satisfied.

Therefore, we need to update the state with the new value of `i`.

State: **`ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on the i-th bit of `x` and `y`, `i` is 1, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`**
