The code snippet `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` is popping the values from the `kwargs` dictionary. It pops the value for the key `'sep'` with a default value of a single space `' '` and assigns it to the variable `sep`. Similarly, it pops the value for the key `'file'` with a default value of `sys.stdout` and assigns it to the variable `file`.

Since the initial state is `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{9}, and no other variables are affected by this code snippet, the values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{9}; `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or a single space `' '`, and `file` is either the value of `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout`.**
