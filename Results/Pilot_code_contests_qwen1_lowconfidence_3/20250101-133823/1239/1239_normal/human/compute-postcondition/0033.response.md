The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of variables outside the loop. Since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement will not have any effect on the variables. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `i` must be less than 32, `func_1()` returns a positive integer, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the bitwise conditions involving `x` and `y` as returned by `func_3()`**
