Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. It iterates a number of times specified by `func_1()`, each time calling `func_3()` to obtain two integers `x` and `y`. During each iteration, it calculates the bitwise XOR of `x` and `y` and accumulates the result in `ans`. If the bit at position `i` in `x` and `y` is either both set or both unset, the bit is skipped; otherwise, it is included in the XOR operation. After the loop completes, `func_20(ans)` is called with the accumulated XOR result as its argument. The final state of the program includes `ans` being the bitwise XOR of all pairs `(x, y)` obtained from `func_3()` over the iterations, and `x` and `y` being the values from the last iteration of the loop.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If `func_1()` returns 0, the loop will not execute, and no calls to `func_3()` will be made.
- If `func_3()` returns invalid values (e.g., non-integer values), the behavior is undefined. However, since the function assumes valid integer inputs within the given constraints, this should not occur under normal circumstances.

**Missing functionality:**
- The code does not handle any errors or edge cases related to the values returned by `func_3()`. If `func_3()` returns values outside the range \(1 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), the behavior is undefined.
