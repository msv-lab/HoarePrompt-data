Functionality: **The function `func_20()` accepts a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It writes these arguments to a specified output stream (`file`), which defaults to `sys.stdout`. The function writes the arguments separated by a specified separator (`sep`), which defaults to a single space. After writing the arguments, it appends an end character (`end`), which defaults to a newline character, and flushes the output buffer if requested. The function does not return any value.

- The function writes each element of `args` to `file`, separated by `sep`.
- If `args` is not empty, it ensures that `at_start` is `False` before starting the loop, ensuring proper separators are used.
- After the loop, it writes the `end` character specified in `kwargs` or the default newline character.
- If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, it flushes the output buffer to ensure all data is written immediately.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where `args` is an empty list; it assumes `args` will always contain at least one element.
- There is no explicit handling for invalid types in `args` or `kwargs`. The function will attempt to convert non-string elements to strings, but it does not validate their types or ranges (e.g., ensuring `a` and `b` are within the specified range).
- The function does not process the `t`, `a`, and `b` variables mentioned in the initial description, as these variables are not used within the function body.**
