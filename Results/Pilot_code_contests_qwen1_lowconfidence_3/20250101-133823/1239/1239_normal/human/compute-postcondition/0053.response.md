`ans` is assigned the value either 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the 2nd bit of `x` and `y`. The code `ans += 1 << i` shifts 1 left by `i` positions and adds the result to `ans`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so let's denote it as `i`.

- If `i` is 0, `1 << i` equals 1.
- If `i` is 1, `1 << i` equals 2.
- If `i` is 2, `1 << i` equals 4.

In each case, `ans` is updated accordingly. However, since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we consider all possible cases:

- If `i` is 0, `ans` becomes `ans + 1`.
- If `i` is 1, `ans` becomes `ans + 2`.
- If `i` is 2, `ans` becomes `ans + 4`.

Therefore, the updated values of `ans` depend on its initial value (0, 1, 2, or 3) and the value of `i`.

Output State: **`ans` is either `ans + 1`, `ans + 2`, or `ans + 4` depending on its initial value and the value of `i` (which can be 0, 1, or 2).**
