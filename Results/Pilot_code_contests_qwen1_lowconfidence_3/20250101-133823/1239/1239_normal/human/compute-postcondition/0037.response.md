The function `func_20(ans)` is called with the argument `ans`. The value of `ans` is determined by the condition specified in the initial state. The function call itself does not assign a value back to any variable; it simply calls the function. Therefore, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`func_1()` returns a positive integer, `ans` is the sum of all positions `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to 31) such that `(x & 1 << i) and (y & 1 << i)` or `(not x & 1 << i) and (not y & 1 << i)` is true, `i` is 31, and `i` must be less than 32, and `func_20(ans)` is called.**
