The provided code snippet is a docstring and does not contain any executable statements that would change the values of variables. It only describes what the function prints but does not define or modify any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{9}.**
