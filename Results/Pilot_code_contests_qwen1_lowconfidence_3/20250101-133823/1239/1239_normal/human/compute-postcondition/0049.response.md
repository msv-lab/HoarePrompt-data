The code `ans += 1 << i` impacts the variable `ans` by shifting the value `1` to the left by `i` positions and then adding this shifted value to `ans`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, `ans` is either 0 or 1, and both `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`, the operation `1 << i` will shift `1` one position to the left, resulting in `2` (which is `10` in binary).

Since `ans` is initially either 0 or 1, adding `2` to `ans` will change its value to either `2` (if `ans` was `0`) or `3` (if `ans` was `1`). The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `func_3()` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is either 2 or 3; `i` is 1; `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`**
