Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `i` must be less than 32, `func_1()` returns a positive integer, `ans` is 0 or 1 depending on whether the bitwise AND of `x` with \(1\) left-shifted by `i` and `y` with \(1\) left-shifted by `i` is true, or both are false. `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()`.***
