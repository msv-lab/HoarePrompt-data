Output State: **`func_1()` returns a positive integer, `ans` is the sum of all positions `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to 31) such that `(x & 1 << i) and (y & 1 << i)` or `(not x & 1 << i) and (not y & 1 << i)` is true, `i` is 31, and `i` must be less than 32.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each bit position `i` from 0 to 31.
- For each bit position, it checks if the `ith` bit of both `x` and `y` are either both set (`1`) or both not set (`0`).
- If this condition is met, it adds `2^i` to `ans`.
- Since the loop runs exactly 32 times (from `i = 0` to `i = 31`), after the loop completes, `i` will be 31.
- `ans` will be the sum of all positions `i` where the condition `(x & 1 << i) and (y & 1 << i)` or `(not x & 1 << i) and (not y & 1 << i)` is true.

This final state captures the essence of what `ans` represents and the constraints on the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.
