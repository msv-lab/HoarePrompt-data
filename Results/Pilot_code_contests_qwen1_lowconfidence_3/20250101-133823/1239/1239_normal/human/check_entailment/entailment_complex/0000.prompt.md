You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In order to celebrate Twice's 5th anniversary, Tzuyu and Sana decided to play a game.

Tzuyu gave Sana two integers a and b and a really important quest.

In order to complete the quest, Sana has to output the smallest possible value of (a ⊕ x) + (b ⊕ x) for any given x, where ⊕ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR). 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}). Description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{9}).

Output

For each testcase, output the smallest possible value of the given expression.

Example

Input


6
6 12
4 9
59 832
28 14
4925 2912
1 1


Output


10
13
891
18
6237
0

Note

For the first test case Sana can choose x=4 and the value will be (6 ⊕ 4) + (12 ⊕ 4) = 2 + 8 = 10. It can be shown that this is the smallest possible value.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{9}.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input by the user, which is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 for the test case
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer input from the user and returns it. This integer is guaranteed to be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. There are no additional actions performed by the function other than reading the input and returning it. The function assumes that the user will provide a valid integer within the specified range, and no validation or error handling is included to ensure this condition is met.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no input processing or variable definitions within the provided function. The function does not take any parameters and returns a string which is expected to be further processed elsewhere in the program. However, based on the problem description, it seems the function should process the input test cases.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input test case as a string
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns a string representing the input test case obtained from user input. After the function concludes, the program state includes a string variable containing the input test case provided by the user. This input can be further processed elsewhere in the program. However, the function does not perform any additional processing on the input; it merely returns it as-is. There are no edge cases mentioned in the provided code, and the code aligns perfectly with the return postconditions.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_3()` are defined or used within its body. The function reads input from stdin, which consists of multiple test cases, each containing two space-separated integers `a` and `b`, representing the values provided by Tzuyu to Sana. The input format is such that the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b`. Each integer `a` and `b` satisfies the condition 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object containing integers a and b for each test case, where each integer a and b are provided by Tzuyu to Sana and satisfy the condition 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` reads input from standard input, which consists of multiple test cases, each containing two space-separated integers `a` and `b`. It processes the input to convert these integers into a map object. The map object contains tuples of integers `(a, b)` for each test case, where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling. The function does not perform any additional operations on the integers `a` and `b` other than converting them from string to integer type.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, a and b are space-separated integers from the input where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object containing strings converted from the space-separated integers input, where the number of test cases is represented by 't' and each test case consists of two integers 'a' and 'b' within the range of 1 to 10^9
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` accepts no explicit parameters but relies on user input to process a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of space-separated integers `a` and `b`. Each integer pair is processed such that `a` and `b` are converted to strings. The function then returns a map object containing these string representations of the integer pairs.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}. Each test case consists of two integers a and b such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{9}.
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list generated by func_3() which is not defined in the given code snippet.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts no parameters and returns a list generated by `func_3()`. Since `func_3()` is not defined in the given code snippet, the behavior of `func_5` is undefined. However, assuming `func_3()` is properly defined and returns a list, `func_5` will return this list. There are no explicit preconditions mentioned for `func_5`, but implicitly, it relies on `func_3()` having a valid return value. No additional actions or state changes are performed within `func_5`.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no direct precondition related to the variables a and b within the provided function. However, it is implied that a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{9}, based on the problem description.
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and stack size for a new thread, then starts a new thread to execute the `main` function. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, a new thread is running and executing the `main` function, which implies that the outcome depends on the behavior of the `main` function. No specific state changes or calculations are performed by `func_6` itself.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: item is a tuple or list containing exactly two integers, representing the values of a and b for a single test case.
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
    #The program returns item[1], which is the second integer in the tuple or list 'item'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `item`, which is expected to be a tuple or list containing exactly two integers. The function returns the second integer in `item`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling. The function simply extracts and returns the second element of the input, ensuring that the input is a tuple or list of exactly two integers. If the input does not meet these requirements, the behavior is not specified within the given code and annotations.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a sorted list of [a, b] in descending order based on the getKey function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a single parameter `l`, which is expected to be a list containing exactly two integers `[a, b]` where `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`. It returns a new list that is a sorted version of `l` in descending order based on the result of applying the `getKey` function to each element. If `l` does not contain exactly two elements, the function will raise a `ValueError`. No other modifications are made to the input list; the function works on a copy of the input list. The function does not handle cases where `l` contains more than two elements or elements outside the specified range.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not contribute to the problem directly, as it creates a matrix filled with a specified number `num` of size `n` x `m`. The variables `n` and `m` represent dimensions of the matrix, and `num` is the value to fill the matrix with. However, based on the problem description, there is no relation between `n`, `m`, and the variables `a` and `b` mentioned in the problem.
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #The program returns a matrix (list of lists) filled with the specified number `num`, of size `n` x `m`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. Here, `n` and `m` are integers specifying the dimensions of the matrix, and `num` is an integer value to fill the matrix with. The function returns a matrix (list of lists) filled with the specified number `num`, of size `n` x `m`. The function does not have any edge cases or missing functionality; it correctly constructs and returns the matrix as described.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer.
def func_10(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns True if x is 0 or False if x is a non-zero non-negative integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts a non-negative integer `x`. It returns `True` if `x` is 0 and `False` if `x` is any other non-zero non-negative integer. The function leverages the bitwise operation `x & (x - 1)` to check if `x` is a power of two. If `x` is a power of two, `x & (x - 1)` equals zero, which would result in `not x` being `True`. However, the given code does not correctly implement this logic; instead, it directly uses `return x and not x & x - 1`, which simplifies to `return x and x == 1` due to the properties of the bitwise AND operation. This means the function will return `True` only if `x` is exactly 1 and `False` otherwise. An edge case to consider is when `x` is 0, which should also return `True`, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly. Therefore, the function should be revised to correctly handle the edge case where `x` is 0.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns a binary string representation of the integer n without the '0b' prefix
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\)) and returns a binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix. The function converts the integer to its binary form using the built-in `bin()` function and then removes the '0b' prefix. The function handles the specified range of integers and correctly returns the binary string representation for any valid input within this range. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling beyond the given range constraints.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the number 'n'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and returns a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the number `n`. The function converts the integer `n` into a string, then iterates over each character in the string representation of `n`, converting each character back into an integer, and finally returns a list of these integers. This process effectively separates the digits of `n` and presents them as a list of individual integers. Potential edge cases include when `n` is at the boundary values (1 and \(10^9\)), though the code handles typical integer values within the specified range without issues. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= n.
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))
    #`The program returns factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))` where `n` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r` with the constraint 0 <= r <= n. It returns the result of the expression `factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))`. This expression calculates the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose `r` elements from a set of `n` elements without regard to the order of selection. The function handles the case where `r` could be 0 or `n`, ensuring that `max(n - r, 1)` avoids division by zero when `r` equals `n`. No additional edge cases or missing functionality are present in the given code.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers such that 1 <= y <= x and x > 0.
def func_14(x, y):
    if (x % y == 0) :
        return x // y
        #`The program returns the integer division of x by y, given that x % y == 0
    else :
        return x // y + 1
        #`x // y + 1`, where `x` is an integer greater than 0 and not divisible by `y`, and `y` is an integer such that 1 <= y <= x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both integers with the condition that `1 <= y <= x` and `x > 0`. It returns the integer division of `x` by `y` if `x` is divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`). If `x` is not divisible by `y`, it returns the integer division of `x` by `y` plus one (`x // y + 1`). This ensures that the returned value is always greater than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `y`.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers, and p is a positive integer (p > 0).
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'x' is \( (x \, \% \, p) \), 'y' is 0, 'p' is a positive integer, and 'res' is \( (x^{original \, y} \, \% \, p) \)
    return res
    #The program returns (x ^ y % p), where x is (x % p) and y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`. It reduces `x` modulo `p` and sets `y` to 0. Then, it computes the modular exponentiation of `x` raised to the power of the original `y` value, modulo `p`, using an efficient algorithm known as exponentiation by squaring. The function returns the result of this computation.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers.
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'x' is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of 'x' and 'y', 'y' is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x that is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of x and y, which is x since y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function repeatedly updates `x` and `y` such that `x` becomes `y` and `y` becomes `x % y` until `y` is 0. At this point, the function returns `x`, which is the GCD of the initial values of `x` and `y`. The function handles the edge case where `y` is already 0, returning `x` directly without further computation.

#Function 17:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
def func_17(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `n` is greater than 3
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and greater than 3, and `n` is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer at least 144 and not divisible by 2 or 3, `i` is increased by 6, the loop executes as long as `i * i` is less than or equal to `n`, and no factors of `n` were found that are of the form `i` or `i + 2` where `i` starts from 5 and increments by 6 each iteration.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_17` accepts an integer `n` as a parameter and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3. It returns `False` for all other values of `n`. Specifically:
- If `n` is less than 2, it returns `False`.
- If `n` is 2 or 3, it returns `True`.
- If `n` is even or divisible by 3, it returns `False`.
- For larger values of `n`, it checks divisibility starting from 5 up to the square root of `n`, incrementing by 6 each time, to find any factors of the form `i` or `i + 2`. If such a factor is found, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

Potential edge cases:
- For `n < 2`, the function correctly returns `False`.
- For `n = 2` or `n = 3`, the function correctly returns `True`.
- For even numbers or multiples of 3, the function correctly returns `False`.
- For larger numbers, the function uses an optimized trial division method, checking only up to the square root of `n` and skipping multiples of 2 and 3, which ensures efficiency while still being correct for prime checking.

Missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `n` is an integer, but there is no validation to ensure this. If `n` is not an integer, the behavior is undefined.
- While the function is designed to efficiently check for primes, it does not handle very large integers optimally due to the square root calculation.

#Function 18:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{9}.
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and its primary action is to redirect the standard input and output streams. Specifically, it opens the file `input.txt` for reading and `output.txt` for writing, effectively changing where the program reads from and writes to. This means that any input read by the program during its execution will be taken from `input.txt`, and any output generated will be written to `output.txt`. There are no return values, and the state of the program after the function concludes is that the standard I/O streams have been redirected to these files. No other processing or transformations are performed on the input or output data.

#Function 19:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9.
def func_19():
    for _ in range(func_1()):
        x, y = func_3()
        
        ans = 0
        
        for i in range(32):
            if x & 1 << i and y & 1 << i or not x & 1 << i and not y & 1 << i:
                continue
            else:
                ans += 1 << i
        
        func_20(ans)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is the bitwise XOR of the original `x` and `y` values, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_3()` during the last iteration, and `func_1()` returns a positive integer indicating the number of iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. It iterates a number of times specified by `func_1()`, each time calling `func_3()` to obtain two integers `x` and `y`. During each iteration, it calculates the bitwise XOR of `x` and `y` and accumulates the result in `ans`. If the bit at position `i` in `x` and `y` is either both set or both unset, the bit is skipped; otherwise, it is included in the XOR operation. After the loop completes, `func_20(ans)` is called with the accumulated XOR result as its argument. The final state of the program includes `ans` being the bitwise XOR of all pairs `(x, y)` obtained from `func_3()` over the iterations, and `x` and `y` being the values from the last iteration of the loop.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_20()` accepts a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It writes these arguments to a specified output stream (`file`), which defaults to `sys.stdout`. The function writes the arguments separated by a specified separator (`sep`), which defaults to a single space. After writing the arguments, it appends an end character (`end`), which defaults to a newline character, and flushes the output buffer if requested. The function does not return any value.

- The function writes each element of `args` to `file`, separated by `sep`.
- If `args` is not empty, it ensures that `at_start` is `False` before starting the loop, ensuring proper separators are used.
- After the loop, it writes the `end` character specified in `kwargs` or the default newline character.
- If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, it flushes the output buffer to ensure all data is written immediately.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where `args` is an empty list; it assumes `args` will always contain at least one element.
- There is no explicit handling for invalid types in `args` or `kwargs`. The function will attempt to convert non-string elements to strings, but it does not validate their types or ranges (e.g., ensuring `a` and `b` are within the specified range).
- The function does not process the `t`, `a`, and `b` variables mentioned in the initial description, as these variables are not used within the function body.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
