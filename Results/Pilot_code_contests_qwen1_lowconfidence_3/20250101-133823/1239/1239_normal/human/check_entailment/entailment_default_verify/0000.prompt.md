You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In order to celebrate Twice's 5th anniversary, Tzuyu and Sana decided to play a game.

Tzuyu gave Sana two integers a and b and a really important quest.

In order to complete the quest, Sana has to output the smallest possible value of (a ⊕ x) + (b ⊕ x) for any given x, where ⊕ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR). 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}). Description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{9}).

Output

For each testcase, output the smallest possible value of the given expression.

Example

Input


6
6 12
4 9
59 832
28 14
4925 2912
1 1


Output


10
13
891
18
6237
0

Note

For the first test case Sana can choose x=4 and the value will be (6 ⊕ 4) + (12 ⊕ 4) = 2 + 8 = 10. It can be shown that this is the smallest possible value.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program aims to find the smallest possible value of \((a \oplus x) + (b \oplus x)\) for any integer \(x\), where \(\oplus\) denotes the bitwise XOR operation. The key observation here is that for any integer \(x\), \((a \oplus x) + (b \oplus x)\) simplifies to \(a + b - 2x \oplus x\). Since \(x \oplus x = 0\), the expression further simplifies to \(a + b\).

However, the program does not directly compute \(a + b\). Instead, it iterates through all possible values of \(x\) from 0 to \(2^{31} - 1\) (since \(a\) and \(b\) are up to \(10^9\)), which would be highly inefficient. Given the constraints, the most optimal solution involves just returning \(a + b\).

To verify correctness:
- For any \(x\), the value \((a \oplus x) + (b \oplus x)\) can be simplified to \(a + b\).
- Therefore, the minimum value is simply \(a + b\).

Since the program does not implement this logic but rather a brute-force approach, it fails to meet the requirement efficiently. However, the problem statement asks for the smallest possible value, and the optimal solution is to return \(a + b\) directly. Thus, the provided program, although inefficient, does not contradict the problem statement. Hence, the program is considered correct according to the given criteria.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 20 : The function `func_20()` accepts a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It writes these arguments to a specified output stream (`file`), which defaults to `sys.stdout`. The function writes the arguments separated by a specified separator (`sep`), which defaults to a single space. After writing the arguments, it appends an end character (`end`), which defaults to a newline character, and flushes the output buffer if requested. The function does not return any value.

- The function writes each element of `args` to `file`, separated by `sep`.
- If `args` is not empty, it ensures that `at_start` is `False` before starting the loop, ensuring proper separators are used.
- After the loop, it writes the `end` character specified in `kwargs` or the default newline character.
- If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, it flushes the output buffer to ensure all data is written immediately.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where `args` is an empty list; it assumes `args` will always contain at least one element.
- There is no explicit handling for invalid types in `args` or `kwargs`. The function will attempt to convert non-string elements to strings, but it does not validate their types or ranges (e.g., ensuring `a` and `b` are within the specified range).
- The function does not process the `t`, `a`, and `b` variables mentioned in the initial description, as these variables are not used within the function body.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
