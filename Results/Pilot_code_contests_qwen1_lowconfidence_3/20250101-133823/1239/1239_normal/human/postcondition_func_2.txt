The function `func_3()` reads input from standard input, which consists of multiple test cases, each containing two space-separated integers `a` and `b`. It processes the input to convert these integers into a map object. The map object contains tuples of integers `(a, b)` for each test case, where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling. The function does not perform any additional operations on the integers `a` and `b` other than converting them from string to integer type.
