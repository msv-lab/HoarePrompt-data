The function `func_4()` accepts no explicit parameters but relies on user input to process a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of space-separated integers `a` and `b`. Each integer pair is processed such that `a` and `b` are converted to strings. The function then returns a map object containing these string representations of the integer pairs.
