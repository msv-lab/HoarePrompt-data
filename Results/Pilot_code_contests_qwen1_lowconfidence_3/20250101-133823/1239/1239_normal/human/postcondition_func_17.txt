The function does not accept any parameters and its primary action is to redirect the standard input and output streams. Specifically, it opens the file `input.txt` for reading and `output.txt` for writing, effectively changing where the program reads from and writes to. This means that any input read by the program during its execution will be taken from `input.txt`, and any output generated will be written to `output.txt`. There are no return values, and the state of the program after the function concludes is that the standard I/O streams have been redirected to these files. No other processing or transformations are performed on the input or output data.
