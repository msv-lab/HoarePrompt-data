None of the variables in the function `func_3()` are defined or used within its body. The function reads input from stdin, which consists of multiple test cases, each containing two space-separated integers `a` and `b`, representing the values provided by Tzuyu to Sana. The input format is such that the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b`. Each integer `a` and `b` satisfies the condition 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
