The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. It iterates a number of times specified by `func_1()`, each time calling `func_3()` to obtain two integers `x` and `y`. During each iteration, it calculates the bitwise XOR of `x` and `y` and accumulates the result in `ans`. If the bit at position `i` in `x` and `y` is either both set or both unset, the bit is skipped; otherwise, it is included in the XOR operation. After the loop completes, `func_20(ans)` is called with the accumulated XOR result as its argument. The final state of the program includes `ans` being the bitwise XOR of all pairs `(x, y)` obtained from `func_3()` over the iterations, and `x` and `y` being the values from the last iteration of the loop.
