This function does not contribute to the problem directly, as it creates a matrix filled with a specified number `num` of size `n` x `m`. The variables `n` and `m` represent dimensions of the matrix, and `num` is the value to fill the matrix with. However, based on the problem description, there is no relation between `n`, `m`, and the variables `a` and `b` mentioned in the problem.
