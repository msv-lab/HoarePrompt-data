The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. Here, `n` and `m` are integers specifying the dimensions of the matrix, and `num` is an integer value to fill the matrix with. The function returns a matrix (list of lists) filled with the specified number `num`, of size `n` x `m`. The function does not have any edge cases or missing functionality; it correctly constructs and returns the matrix as described.
