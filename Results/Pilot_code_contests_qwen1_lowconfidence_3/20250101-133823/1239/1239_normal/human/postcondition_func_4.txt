The function `func_5` accepts no parameters and returns a list generated by `func_3()`. Since `func_3()` is not defined in the given code snippet, the behavior of `func_5` is undefined. However, assuming `func_3()` is properly defined and returns a list, `func_5` will return this list. There are no explicit preconditions mentioned for `func_5`, but implicitly, it relies on `func_3()` having a valid return value. No additional actions or state changes are performed within `func_5`.
