The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and stack size for a new thread, then starts a new thread to execute the `main` function. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, a new thread is running and executing the `main` function, which implies that the outcome depends on the behavior of the `main` function. No specific state changes or calculations are performed by `func_6` itself.
