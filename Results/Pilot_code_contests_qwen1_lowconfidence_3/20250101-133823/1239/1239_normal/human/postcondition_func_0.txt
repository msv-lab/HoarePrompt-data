The function `func_1` reads an integer input from the user and returns it. This integer is guaranteed to be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. There are no additional actions performed by the function other than reading the input and returning it. The function assumes that the user will provide a valid integer within the specified range, and no validation or error handling is included to ensure this condition is met.
