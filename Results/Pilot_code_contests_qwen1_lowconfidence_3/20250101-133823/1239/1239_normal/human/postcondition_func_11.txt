The function `func_12` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and returns a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the number `n`. The function converts the integer `n` into a string, then iterates over each character in the string representation of `n`, converting each character back into an integer, and finally returns a list of these integers. This process effectively separates the digits of `n` and presents them as a list of individual integers. Potential edge cases include when `n` is at the boundary values (1 and \(10^9\)), though the code handles typical integer values within the specified range without issues. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.
