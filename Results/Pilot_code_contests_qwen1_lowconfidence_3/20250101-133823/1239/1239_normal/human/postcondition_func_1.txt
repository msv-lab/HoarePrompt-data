The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns a string representing the input test case obtained from user input. After the function concludes, the program state includes a string variable containing the input test case provided by the user. This input can be further processed elsewhere in the program. However, the function does not perform any additional processing on the input; it merely returns it as-is. There are no edge cases mentioned in the provided code, and the code aligns perfectly with the return postconditions.
