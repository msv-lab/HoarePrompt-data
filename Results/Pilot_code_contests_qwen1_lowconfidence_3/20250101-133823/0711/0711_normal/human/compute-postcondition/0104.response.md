Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `s`, `alpha`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `rec1`, `rec2`, `i`, `neigh` retain their original values according to the precondition. If `i > 0` and `s[i] == s[i - 1]` or (`i < n - 1` and `s[i] == s[i + 1]`), then `ans2` is modified such that the value at index `i` is replaced by `chosen`, `rec2` is incremented by 1, and `chosen` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged and `rec2` remains 0.***
