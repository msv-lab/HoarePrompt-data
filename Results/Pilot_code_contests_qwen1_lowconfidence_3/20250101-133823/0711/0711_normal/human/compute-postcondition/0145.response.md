The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match-case statement. Since there is no such context provided, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`alpha` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than before), `c` is the first character in the remaining `alpha`, `neigh` contains all previously processed characters including the new `c`, and `chosen` is equal to `c`. We break out of the most internal loop or match-case statement.**
