The code `print(''.join(ans2))` concatenates all elements in the list `ans2` into a single string and prints it. However, this operation does not modify any of the variables `ans2`, `i`, `valid2`, or `rec2`. 

Output State: **`ans2` is a list of integers, `i` is the length of `ans2`, `valid2` is `True` if there were no pairs of consecutive elements in `ans2` that were equal, otherwise `valid2` is `False`, `rec2` is its original value**
