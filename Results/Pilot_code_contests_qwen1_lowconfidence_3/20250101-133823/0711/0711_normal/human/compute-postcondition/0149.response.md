`rec2` is incremented by 1, which means `rec2 += 1`. The other variables (`alpha`, `c`, `neigh`, `chosen`, and `ans2[i]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`alpha` is an empty string, `c` is the last character that was not in `neigh`, `neigh` contains all characters from `alpha`, `chosen` is either equal to `c` or unchanged, depending on whether `c` was already in `neigh`; `ans2[i]` is set to `chosen`, `rec2` is 1 more than its original value.**
