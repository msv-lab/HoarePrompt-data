The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the innermost enclosing block (like a loop or match-case statement). In this context, since there is no loop or match-case statement to exit, the variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `alpha`, `c`, and `chosen` remain unchanged. The `break` statement does not alter any variable values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(5 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is the string input by the user with a length of at least 2, `alpha` is the first `k` characters of the uppercase English alphabet string `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`, `c` is a character from `s` that is not in the set `neigh`, `chosen` is equal to `c`**
