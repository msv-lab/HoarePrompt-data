Postcondition: ***`ans2` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `ans2`, and `valid2` is `False`. If `ans2[i]` is equal to `ans2[i - 1]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the state remains unchanged if the condition is not met.***
