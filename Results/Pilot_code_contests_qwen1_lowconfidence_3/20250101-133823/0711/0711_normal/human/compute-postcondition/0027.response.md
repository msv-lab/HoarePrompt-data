Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(5 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is the string input by the user with a length of at least 2, `alpha` is the first `k` characters of the uppercase English alphabet string `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`, `c` is the next character in `alpha` after the current `c`. If `c` is not in `neigh`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
