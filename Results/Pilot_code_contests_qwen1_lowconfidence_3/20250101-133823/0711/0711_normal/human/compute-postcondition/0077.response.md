Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(5 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is a string input by the user with a length of at least 2, `alpha` is the first `k` characters of the uppercase English alphabet string `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`, `neigh` is a tuple that includes the character `s[7]`, `i` is 7, `chosen` is the first character in `alpha` that is not in `neigh`, `ans1[7]` is `chosen`, `rec1` is updated to `rec1 + 2`, and `rec2` remains 0. This occurs if either `i > 0` and `s[i] == s[i - 1]` or `(i < n - 1) and (s[i] == s[i + 1])`. Otherwise, `i` remains 6, `chosen` remains unchanged, `ans1[7]` remains unchanged, `rec1` is updated to `rec1 + 1`, and `rec2` remains 0.***
