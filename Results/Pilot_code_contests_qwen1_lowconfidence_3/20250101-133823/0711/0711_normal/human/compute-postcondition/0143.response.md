Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `alpha` is a non-empty string, but it is one character shorter than before.
   - `c` is the next character in the string `alpha`.
   - `neigh` contains all previously processed characters including the new `c`.
   - If `c` is not in `neigh`, then `c` is added to `neigh` and `chosen` is set to `c`. If `c` is already in `neigh`, no changes are made to `neigh` or `chosen`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `alpha`.
   - After each iteration, `alpha` becomes one character shorter because the current character `c` is being processed.

3. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `alpha` is one character shorter.
   - `c` is the next character in the updated `alpha`.
   - `neigh` contains all previously processed characters including the new `c`.
   - `chosen` may have been set to `c` if `c` was not already in `neigh`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `alpha` must still contain at least one character.
   - Therefore, `alpha` must be non-empty and have at least one character remaining.

5. **Updating States**:
   - Since `alpha` is one character shorter, it must still be non-empty.
   - `c` is now the first character in the remaining `alpha`.
   - `neigh` will include all previously processed characters plus the new `c`.
   - `chosen` may be updated to `c` if `c` was not already in `neigh`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`alpha` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than before), `c` is the first character in the remaining `alpha`, `neigh` contains all previously processed characters including the new `c`, and `chosen` may be set to `c` if `c` was not already in `neigh`.**
