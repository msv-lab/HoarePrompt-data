The given code snippet `ans2[i] = chosen` assigns the value of `chosen` to the index `i` in the list `ans2`. However, since the initial state does not provide specific values for `ans2` or `chosen`, we cannot determine their exact values after execution. The only change is that the value of `chosen` is assigned to the index `i` in `ans2`.

Output State: **`ans2` is a list where the value at index `i` is `chosen`; the values at other indices remain unchanged, and `chosen` retains its original value.**
