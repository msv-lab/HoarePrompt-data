The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables but indicates that we break out of the current loop or block of code. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`alpha` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than before), `c` is the next character in the string `alpha`, `neigh` contains all previously processed characters including the new `c`, `chosen` is equal to `c`, and we break out of the most internal loop or block of code.**
