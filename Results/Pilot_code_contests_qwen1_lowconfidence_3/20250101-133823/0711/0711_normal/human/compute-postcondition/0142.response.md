Postcondition: ***`alpha` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than before), `c` is the next character in the string `alpha`, `neigh` contains all previously processed characters including the new `c`. If `c` is not in `neigh`, then `c` is added to `neigh` and `chosen` is set to `c`. If `c` is already in `neigh`, no changes are made to `neigh` or `chosen`.***
