The `break` statement does not modify any variables and simply exits the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(5 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is the string input by the user with a length of at least 2, `alpha` is the first `k` characters of the uppercase English alphabet string `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`, `c` is the next character in `alpha` after the current `c`, `chosen` is the next character in `alpha` after the current `c`.**
