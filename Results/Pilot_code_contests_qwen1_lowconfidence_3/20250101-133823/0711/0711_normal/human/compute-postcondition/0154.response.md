Postcondition: **`i` is at least 1 and less than the length of `ans1`. `n` is a specific value, `k` is a specific value, `s` is a specific value, `alpha` is the first `k` characters of the uppercase English alphabet string `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`, `ans1` is a list where each character at an even index in `s` is replaced by a character from `alpha` that is not present in its neighborhood (`neigh`) if such a character exists, `ans2` is identical to `s`, `rec1` is the total number of replacements made in `ans1`, `rec2` is the total number of replacements made in `ans2`, `valid1` is `True`. The current value of `ans1[i]` is equal to the current value of `ans1[i - 1]`**
