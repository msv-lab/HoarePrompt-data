The code initializes two variables `rec1` and `rec2` with the value `0`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `alpha`, `ans1`, or `ans2`. Therefore, the output state will include all the initial variables with their original values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is the string input by the user, `alpha` is the first `k` characters of the uppercase English alphabet string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans1` is a list containing each character of `s`, `ans2` is a list containing each character of `s`, `rec1` is 0, `rec2` is 0**
