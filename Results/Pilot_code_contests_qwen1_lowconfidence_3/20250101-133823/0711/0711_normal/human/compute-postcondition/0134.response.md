Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Identify the Loop Variable and Iterable:**
   - The loop variable is `c`.
   - The iterable is `alpha`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, the iterable `alpha` must contain at least one character. If `alpha` is empty, the loop will not execute.

3. **Check the Given States:**
   - `n` is a specific value.
   - `k` is a specific value.
   - `s` is a specific value.
   - `alpha` is a non-empty string (this means `alpha` contains at least one character).
   - `ans1` is a specific value.
   - `ans2[n]` is either `ans1` or a specific character `c`.
   - `rec1` is a specific value.
   - `rec2` is the original value of `rec2` plus 2.
   - `i` is `n + 2`.
   - `neigh` is either `(s[n + 1], s[n + 3])` or `(s[n + 3],)` depending on whether `i < n - 1` holds true or not.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `alpha` must contain at least one character for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `alpha` is not empty. This condition is already met as per the given information.
   - The other states (`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans1`, `ans2[n]`, `rec1`, `rec2`, `i`, and `neigh`) do not affect the ability of the loop to execute, as they do not influence the condition that `alpha` must be non-empty.

Given this analysis, no adjustments are needed for the states beyond ensuring that `alpha` is non-empty, which is already satisfied.

**Final Answer:**

State: **`alpha` is a non-empty string**
