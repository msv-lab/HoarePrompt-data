The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block it is in. However, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is a specific value, `k` is a specific value, `s` is a specific value, `alpha` is a non-empty string, `ans1` is a specific value, `ans2` is a specific value, `rec1` is a specific value, `rec2` is a specific value, `i` is 3, `neigh` is `s[2] + s[3]`, `chosen` is `c`.**
