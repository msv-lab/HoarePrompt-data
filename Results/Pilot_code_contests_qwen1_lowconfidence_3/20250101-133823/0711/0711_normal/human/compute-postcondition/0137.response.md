The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code, the only impact is that the execution would exit the current context (if inside a loop or switch) or proceed to the next line of code outside the current context.

Given that the code snippet only contains a `break` statement and no loops or switches, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`alpha` is a non-empty string, `c` is a character not in the set `neigh`, `neigh` is a set of characters, `chosen` is equal to `c`**
