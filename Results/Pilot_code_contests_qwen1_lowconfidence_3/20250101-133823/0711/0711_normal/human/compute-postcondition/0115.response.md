Postcondition: ***`n` is a specific value, `k` is a specific value, `s` is a specific value, `alpha` is a non-empty string, `ans1` is a specific value, `ans2` is a specific value, `rec1` is a specific value, `rec2` is a specific value, `i` is 2, and `neigh` is `s[2] + s[3]`. If `c` is not in `neigh`, then `chosen` is `c`. Otherwise, no change to the variables.***
