Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(5 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is the string input by the user with a length of at least 2, `alpha` is the first `k` characters of the uppercase English alphabet string `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`, `chosen` is a character from `s` that is either not in the set `neigh` or remains unchanged if there is no such character, `c` is the last character in `alpha` checked that is not in `neigh`, `rec1` and `rec2` are both 0, `neigh` is a tuple containing the character at index `i-1` of `s` followed by the character at index `i + 1` for the last iteration, `i` is the last index in the string `s` where the condition `s[i]` is equal to `s[i - 1]` or `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]`. If the loop does not execute, `chosen` remains `None`.**
