The given Python code snippet prints the concatenated string of the list `ans1`. However, the initial state does not include the definition or value of `ans1`. Since `ans1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its contents. Therefore, the code will raise a NameError when executed because `ans1` is not defined.

Given this situation, the code cannot be executed as stated, and the output state cannot be determined due to the missing definition of `ans1`.

Output State: **The code raises a NameError due to the undefined variable `ans1`.**
