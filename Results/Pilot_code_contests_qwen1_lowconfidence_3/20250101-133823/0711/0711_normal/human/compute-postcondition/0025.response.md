The code `chosen = c` assigns the value of the variable `c` to the variable `chosen`. The value of `c` is the next character in `alpha` after the current `c`, but since the initial state does not specify what the current `c` is, we cannot determine the exact value of `chosen`. However, we know that `c` is a character from the string `alpha`, which consists of the first `k` characters of the uppercase English alphabet.

Given this, the output state will be:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(5 \times 10^5\)
- `k` is an integer between 2 and 26
- `s` is the string input by the user with a length of at least 2
- `alpha` is the first `k` characters of the uppercase English alphabet string `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`
- `c` is the next character in `alpha` after the current `c`
- `chosen` is equal to the next character in `alpha` after the current `c`

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(5 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is the string input by the user with a length of at least 2, `alpha` is the first `k` characters of the uppercase English alphabet string `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`, `c` is the next character in `alpha` after the current `c`, `chosen` is the next character in `alpha` after the current `c`**
