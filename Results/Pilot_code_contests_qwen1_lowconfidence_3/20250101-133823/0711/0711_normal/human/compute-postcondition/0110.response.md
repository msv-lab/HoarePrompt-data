Postcondition: ***`n` is a specific value, `k` is a specific value, `s` is a specific value, `alpha` is a specific value, `ans1` is a specific value, `ans2` is a specific value, `rec1` is a specific value, `rec2` is a specific value, `i` is 2, and `neigh` is `s[2] + s[3]` if `i < n - 1`. Otherwise, the same variables retain their original specific values.***
