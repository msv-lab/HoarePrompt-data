The code `rec1 += 1` increments the value of `rec1` by 1. Since `rec1` was previously `rec1 + 1`, incrementing it by 1 means `rec1` is now `rec1 + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(5 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is a string input by the user with a length of at least 2, `alpha` is the first `k` characters of the uppercase English alphabet string `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`, `neigh` is a tuple that includes the character `s[7]`, `i` is 7, `chosen` is the first character in `alpha` that is not in `neigh`, `ans1[7]` is `chosen`, `rec1` is `rec1 + 2`, and `rec2` remains 0.**
