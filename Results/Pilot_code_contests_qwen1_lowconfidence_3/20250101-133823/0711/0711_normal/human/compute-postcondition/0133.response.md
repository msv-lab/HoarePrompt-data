Postcondition: ***`n` is a specific value, `k` is a specific value, `s` is a specific value, `alpha` is a non-empty string, `ans1` is a specific value, `ans2[n]` is either `ans1` or a specific character `c`, `rec1` is a specific value, `rec2` is the original value of `rec2` plus 2, `i` is `n + 2`, and `neigh` is either `(s[n + 1], s[n + 3])` or `(s[n + 3],)` depending on whether `i < n - 1` holds true or not.***
