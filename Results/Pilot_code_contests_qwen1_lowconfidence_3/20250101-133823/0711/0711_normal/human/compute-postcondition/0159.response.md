`valid1` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The value of `i` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on it. The value of `valid1` is explicitly set to `False`, and the previous state of `valid1` is overridden.

Output State: **`i` is at least 2 and less than the length of `ans1`, `valid1` is False**
