`rec2` is incremented by 1, so its new value is the original value plus 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a specific value, `k` is a specific value, `s` is a specific value, `alpha` is a non-empty string, `ans1` is a specific value, `ans2` is a specific value where `ans2[n]` is either `ans1` or a specific character `c` (if there exists such a character), `rec1` is a specific value, `rec2` is the original value of `rec2` plus 1, `i` is `n`, and `neigh` is `s[2] + s[3]`.

Output State: **`n` is a specific value, `k` is a specific value, `s` is a specific value, `alpha` is a non-empty string, `ans1` is a specific value, `ans2` is a specific value where `ans2[n]` is either `ans1` or a specific character `c` (if there exists such a character), `rec1` is a specific value, `rec2` is the original value of `rec2` plus 1, `i` is `n`, and `neigh` is `s[2] + s[3]`.**
