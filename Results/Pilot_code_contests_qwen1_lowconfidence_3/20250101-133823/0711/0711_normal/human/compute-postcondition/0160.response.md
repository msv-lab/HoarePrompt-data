The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, since there is no loop or if statement that `break` is directly inside, the only thing that happens is that the execution exits the current loop or if statement.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State: `i` is at least 2 and less than the length of `ans1`, `valid1` is False.

Output State: **`i` is at least 2 and less than the length of `ans1`, `valid1` is False**
