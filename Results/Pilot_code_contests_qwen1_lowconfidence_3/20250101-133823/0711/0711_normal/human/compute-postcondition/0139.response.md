Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `alpha` is a non-empty string.
   - `c` is a character that is added to the set `neigh`.

2. **For Loop Analysis**: The for loop iterates over each character in the string `alpha`. The loop condition is `for c in alpha`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The variable `c` takes on each character from the string `alpha` in sequence.
   - The set `neigh` accumulates characters as they are processed.

4. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is the current character being processed from the string `alpha`.
   - Since `alpha` is non-empty, there must still be at least one more character left in `alpha` to process.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `c` from `alpha` must be processed.
   - Since `c` is a character added to the set `neigh` during each iteration, the set `neigh` will contain the character from the previous iteration plus possibly other characters.
   - The key point here is that the string `alpha` must still have at least one more character to process, and the character `c` will be the next character in `alpha`.

6. **Adjusted States**:
   - The string `alpha` remains the same but will now have one fewer character to process.
   - The variable `c` will be the next character in `alpha`.
   - The set `neigh` will contain all previously processed characters plus the new `c`.

Given this reasoning, the adjusted states for the next iteration are:
- `alpha` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than before).
- `c` is the next character in the string `alpha`.
- `neigh` contains all previously processed characters including the new `c`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`alpha` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than before), `c` is the next character in the string `alpha`, `neigh` contains all previously processed characters including the new `c`**.
