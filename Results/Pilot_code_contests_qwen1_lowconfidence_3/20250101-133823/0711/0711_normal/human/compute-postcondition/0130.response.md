The code snippet `neigh += s[i - 1],` appends the character `s[i - 1]` to the tuple `neigh`. Initially, `neigh` is an empty tuple. Given that `i` is `n + 2`, the value of `i - 1` is `n + 1`. Therefore, the character `s[n + 1]` is appended to the tuple `neigh`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged:
- `n` is a specific value
- `k` is a specific value
- `s` is a specific value
- `alpha` is a non-empty string
- `ans1` is a specific value
- `ans2[n]` is either `ans1` or a specific character `c`
- `rec1` is a specific value
- `rec2` is the original value of `rec2` plus 2
- `i` is now `n + 2`
- `neigh` is now `(s[n + 1],)`

Output State: **`n` is a specific value, `k` is a specific value, `s` is a specific value, `alpha` is a non-empty string, `ans1` is a specific value, `ans2[n]` is either `ans1` or a specific character `c`, `rec1` is a specific value, `rec2` is the original value of `rec2` plus 2, `i` is `n + 2`, `neigh` is `(s[n + 1],)`**
