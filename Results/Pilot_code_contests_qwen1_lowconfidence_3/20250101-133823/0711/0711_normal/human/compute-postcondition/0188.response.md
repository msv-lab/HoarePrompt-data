Postcondition: ***`ans2` is a list of integers, `i` is the length of `ans2`, and `valid2` remains unchanged. If `rec1 < rec2` and `valid1` is true or `not valid2` is true, a `NameError` is raised. Otherwise, `valid2` is determined based on whether there are any pairs of consecutive elements in `ans2` that are equal.***
