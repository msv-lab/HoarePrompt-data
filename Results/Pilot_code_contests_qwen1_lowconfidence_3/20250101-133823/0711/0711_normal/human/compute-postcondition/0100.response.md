Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(5 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is the string input by the user and must have at least 1 character, `alpha` is the first `k` characters of the uppercase English alphabet and must have at least 1 character, `ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list identical to `s`, `rec1` is the total number of replacements made in `ans1`, `rec2` is 0, `i` is 3, `neigh` is (s[0], s[2]), `chosen` is the next character in `alpha` after the current `chosen`. If `c` is not in `neigh`, the condition remains unchanged; otherwise, no changes occur since there is no else part.***
