Postcondition: ***`n` is a specific value, `k` is a specific value, `s` is a specific value, `alpha` is a non-empty string, `ans1` is a specific value, `ans2` is a specific value where `ans2[n]` is either `ans1` or a specific character `c` (if there exists such a character), `rec1` is a specific value, `rec2` is the original value of `rec2` plus 1, `i` is `n`, and `neigh` is `s[2] + s[3]`.***

Explanation:
- The if condition checks if `i > 0 and s[i] == s[i - 1] or (i < n - 1 and s[i] == s[i + 1])`.
- If the condition is true, then the postcondition of the if part is applied.
- If the condition is false, then the else part does not change the state of the variables, so the postcondition remains as the one from the if part.
