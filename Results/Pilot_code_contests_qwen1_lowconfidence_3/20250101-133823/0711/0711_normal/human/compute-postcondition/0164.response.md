The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or switch-case structure. Since there is no loop or switch-case in the provided code, the only effect is that the execution will exit the current context (if it was inside one). However, since no such context is present in the given snippet, the variables `i` and `valid1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `valid1` is False**
