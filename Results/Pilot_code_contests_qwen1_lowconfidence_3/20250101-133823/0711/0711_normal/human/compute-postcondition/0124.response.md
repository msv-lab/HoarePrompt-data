Output State: **`n` is a specific value, `k` is a specific value, `s` is a specific value, `alpha` is a non-empty string, `ans1` is a specific value, `ans2` is a specific value, `rec1` is a specific value, `rec2` is a specific value, `i` is `n`, and `neigh` is `s[2] + s[3]`. If there exists a character `c` in `alpha` that is not in `neigh`, then `chosen` is `c`; otherwise, `chosen` remains the original value `ans1` if `ans1` was not modified during the loop.**
