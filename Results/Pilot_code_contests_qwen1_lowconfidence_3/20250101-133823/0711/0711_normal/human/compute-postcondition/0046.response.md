Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(5 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is a string input by the user with a length of at least 2, `alpha` is the first `k` characters of the uppercase English alphabet string `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`, `neigh` is a tuple containing the characters `s[1]` and `s[3]`, `i` is less than `n - 1`, and `chosen` is `'A'` if `c` is not in `neigh`, otherwise `chosen` remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
