The code `chosen = c` assigns the value of `c` to `chosen`. The value of `c` is the first character in the remaining `alpha`, and `neigh` contains all previously processed characters including the new `c`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`alpha` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than before), `c` is the first character in the remaining `alpha`, `neigh` contains all previously processed characters including the new `c`, and `chosen` is equal to `c`.**
