The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. These values are converted from strings using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. Since the initial values of `n` and `k` are within the specified ranges, they are assigned directly from the input. The string of length `n` representing the colors of cells is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5Â·10^5 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26 (inclusive)**
