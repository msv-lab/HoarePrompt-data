Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(5 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is the string input by the user and must have at least 1 character, `alpha` is the first `k` characters of the uppercase English alphabet string `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`, `ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list identical to `s`, `rec1` is the total number of replacements made in `ans1`, `rec2` is 0, `i` is 1, `neigh` is `(s[0], s[2])`, and these hold if `i` is less than `n - 1`. Otherwise, the same variables retain their original values as per the precondition. Additionally, `i` is greater than 0, the current character of `s` at index `i` is equal to the previous character at index `i - 1` or equal to the next character at index `i + 1` if `i` is less than `n - 1`.***
