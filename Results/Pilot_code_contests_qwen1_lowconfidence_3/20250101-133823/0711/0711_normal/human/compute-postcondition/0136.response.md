`chosen` is assigned the value of `c`. The value of `alpha` and the set `neigh` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `alpha` is a non-empty string, `c` is a character not in the set `neigh`, `neigh` is a set of characters, and `chosen` is equal to `c`.

Output State: **`alpha` is a non-empty string, `c` is a character not in the set `neigh`, `neigh` is a set of characters, `chosen` is equal to `c`**
