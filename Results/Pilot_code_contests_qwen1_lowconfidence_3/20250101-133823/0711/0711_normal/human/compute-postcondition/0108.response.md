Postcondition: ***`n` is a specific value, `k` is a specific value, `s` is a specific value, `alpha` is a specific value, `ans1` is a specific value, `ans2` is a specific value, `rec1` is a specific value, `rec2` is a specific value, `i` is 2, `neigh` is (`s[2`)]***

Explanation: Given the if condition `i > 0`, since `i` is initially 3, the condition is true, and we follow the if part's behavior. The else part does not provide any additional changes to the variables, so the overall postcondition remains consistent with the if part's behavior. Therefore, `i` is decremented by 1 to become 2, and `neigh` is updated to include the element `s[2]`.
