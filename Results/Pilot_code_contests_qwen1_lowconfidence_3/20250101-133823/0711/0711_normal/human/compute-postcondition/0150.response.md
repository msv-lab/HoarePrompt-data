Postcondition: ***`alpha` is an empty string, `c` is the last character that was not in `neigh`, `neigh` contains all characters from `alpha`, `chosen` is either equal to `c` or unchanged depending on whether `c` was already in `neigh`; `ans2[i]` is set to `chosen`, and `rec2` is 1 more than its original value. This holds true if `i > 0` and either `s[i] == s[i - 1]` or `i < n - 1 and s[i] == s[i + 1]`. Otherwise, the values of `alpha`, `c`, `neigh`, `chosen`, `ans2[i]`, and `rec2` remain as they were before the if-else block executes.***
