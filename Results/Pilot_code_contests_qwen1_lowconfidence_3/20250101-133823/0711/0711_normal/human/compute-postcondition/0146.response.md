Postcondition: ***`alpha` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than before), `c` is the first character in the remaining `alpha`, `neigh` contains all previously processed characters including the new `c`, and `chosen` is either equal to `c` or unchanged, depending on whether `c` was already in `neigh`. We break out of the most internal loop or match-case statement if `c` is not in `neigh`.***
