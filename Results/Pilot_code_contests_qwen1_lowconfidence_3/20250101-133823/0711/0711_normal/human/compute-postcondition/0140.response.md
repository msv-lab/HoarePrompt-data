The variable `chosen` is assigned the value of `c`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `alpha` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than before), `c` is the next character in the string `alpha`, `neigh` contains all previously processed characters including the new `c`, and `chosen` is equal to `c`.

Output State: **`alpha` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than before), `c` is the next character in the string `alpha`, `neigh` contains all previously processed characters including the new `c`, `chosen` is equal to `c`**
