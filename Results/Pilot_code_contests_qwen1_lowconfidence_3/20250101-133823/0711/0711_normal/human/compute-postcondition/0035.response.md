Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(5 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is the string input by the user with a length of at least 2, `alpha` is the first `k` characters of the uppercase English alphabet string `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`, `chosen` is a character from `s` that is either not in the set `neigh` or remains unchanged if there is no such character, `c` is the last character in `alpha` checked that is not in `neigh`, `rec1` is the previous value of `rec1` + 1, `rec2` is 0, `neigh` is a tuple containing the character `s[1]`, `i` is 2 (the next even index), `ans1[0]` is equal to `chosen`, `chosen` remains `None` if the loop does not execute. If `i` is greater than 0, `neigh` becomes a tuple containing the character `s[1]`. Otherwise, the values remain as specified in the if part.***
