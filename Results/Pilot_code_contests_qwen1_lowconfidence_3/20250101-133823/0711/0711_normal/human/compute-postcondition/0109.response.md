`neigh` is initially equal to `s[2]`. The code adds `s[i + 1]` to `neigh`. Given that `i` is 2, `i + 1` is 3, so `s[i + 1]` is `s[3]`. Therefore, `neigh` becomes `s[2] + s[3]`.

Output State: **`n` is a specific value, `k` is a specific value, `s` is a specific value, `alpha` is a specific value, `ans1` is a specific value, `ans2` is a specific value, `rec1` is a specific value, `rec2` is a specific value, `i` is 2, `neigh` is `s[2] + s[3]`**
