Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(5 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is a string input by the user with a length of at least 2, `alpha` is the first `k` characters of the uppercase English alphabet string `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`, `neigh` is a tuple containing the characters `s[1]` and `s[3]`, `i` is 4 (updated based on the if condition), `chosen` is the first character from `alpha` that is not in `neigh` if such a character exists, otherwise `chosen` remains `None`, `rec1` is updated to `rec1 + 1`, and `rec2` remains 0. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, `neigh` becomes a tuple containing the characters `s[1]` and `s[3]` and `i` is updated to 4. Otherwise, `i` is set to `n - 1` and `chosen` is determined based on the if condition.***
