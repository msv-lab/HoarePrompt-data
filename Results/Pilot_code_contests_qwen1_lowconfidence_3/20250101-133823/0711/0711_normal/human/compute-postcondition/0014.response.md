Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(5 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is the string input by the user and its length must be at least 2, `alpha` is the first `k` characters of the uppercase English alphabet string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans1` and `ans2` are lists containing each character of `s`, `rec1` and `rec2` are both 0, `neigh` is a tuple containing the character at index `i-1` of `s` followed by the character at index `i + 1`, `i` is greater than 0 and either `s[i]` is equal to `s[i - 1]` or `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, `neigh` includes the character at index `i+1` of `s`; otherwise, no change occurs.***
