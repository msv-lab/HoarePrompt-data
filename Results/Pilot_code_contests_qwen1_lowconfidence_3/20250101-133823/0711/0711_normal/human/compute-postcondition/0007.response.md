The line `neigh = ()` creates an empty tuple named `neigh`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `alpha`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `rec1`, and `rec2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(5 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is the string input by the user and its length must be at least 2, `alpha` is the first `k` characters of the uppercase English alphabet string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans1` is a list containing each character of `s`, `ans2` is a list containing each character of `s`, `rec1` is 0, `rec2` is 0, `neigh` is an empty tuple**.
