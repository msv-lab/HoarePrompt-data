You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A colored stripe is represented by a horizontal row of n square cells, each cell is pained one of k colors. Your task is to repaint the minimum number of cells so that no two neighbouring cells are of the same color. You can use any color from 1 to k to repaint the cells.

Input

The first input line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105; 2 ≤ k ≤ 26). The second line contains n uppercase English letters. Letter "A" stands for the first color, letter "B" stands for the second color and so on. The first k English letters may be used. Each letter represents the color of the corresponding cell of the stripe.

Output

Print a single integer — the required minimum number of repaintings. In the second line print any possible variant of the repainted stripe.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a flaw in its logic. Specifically, the program attempts to ensure that no two neighboring cells are of the same color by only considering cells at even and odd indices separately. This approach does not guarantee the minimum number of repaintings for all cases.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
7 3
AABACCA

Expected Output:
2
ABACBAC
```

In this case, the program will output:
```
2
AABACCA
```

This is incorrect because it does not achieve the goal of ensuring no two neighboring cells are the same color with the minimum number of repaintings. The correct output should be `2` repaintings and the sequence `ABACBAC`.

The program fails to consider the global minimum repaintings required to satisfy the condition for the entire sequence. It only checks for even and odd indices independently, which may not lead to the optimal solution in all scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes a string `s` of length `n` consisting of uppercase English letters 'A' to 'J' and two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 26). It aims to replace characters at even indices in `s` with unique characters from the first `k` letters of the English alphabet that do not appear in the neighboring characters. The function performs this replacement twice, storing the results in `ans1` and `ans2`, respectively. It then checks the validity of these new strings by ensuring no two consecutive characters are the same. Finally, it prints the result with the maximum number of replacements while ensuring the resulting string is valid. If both strings have the same number of replacements and neither is valid, the function prints the original string `s`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
