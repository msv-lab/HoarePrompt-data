Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing the number of participants, `b` and `p` are integers representing the number of bottles of water per participant per match and the number of towels per participant. If `potencias[i]` is greater than `x`, the function returns the value at index `i-1` from the array `potencias`, provided `i` is within the bounds of the array and `potencias[i-1]` is less than or equal to `x`. If the condition is not met, no specific action is taken and the postcondition remains as the precondition.***
