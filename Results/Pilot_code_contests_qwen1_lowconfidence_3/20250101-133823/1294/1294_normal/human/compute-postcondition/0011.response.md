The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer representing the number of participants, with the constraint that \(1 \leq x \leq 500\). The function may also reference an array `potencias`, which is not defined in the given snippet but assumed to be relevant based on the cases provided.

- Case_1: The function returns `potencias[i - 1]` where `potencias[i]` is greater than the number of participants `x`.
- Case_2: The function returns a value from the array `potencias` where the index is `i - 1`, with the condition that `i` is within the bounds of the array and `potencias[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `x`.
- Case_3: The function returns `potencias[-1]`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `x` representing the number of participants, and based on certain conditions involving an array `potencias`, it returns a specific value from the array.
