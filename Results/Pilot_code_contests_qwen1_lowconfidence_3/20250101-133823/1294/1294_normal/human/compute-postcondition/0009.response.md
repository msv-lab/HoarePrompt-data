Postcondition: **`x`, `b`, `p`, and `i` remain as integers representing the number of participants, bottles of water per participant per match, number of towels per participant, and index 0 respectively. If `potencias[i]` is greater than `x`, the function returns `potencias[-1]`. Otherwise, no specific change is made to the variables.**
