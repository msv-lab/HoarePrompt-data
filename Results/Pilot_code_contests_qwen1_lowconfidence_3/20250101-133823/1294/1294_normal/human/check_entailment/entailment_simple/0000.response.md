Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `k`:**
   - The function `func_1(x)` is intended to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x`. However, the implementation uses a pre-defined list `potencias` which contains powers of 2 up to 512. This means that for any `n` greater than 512, the function will return 256, which is not correct.
   - For example, if `n = 513`, the function should return 256, but instead, it would return 512, leading to incorrect calculations.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Tournament Rounds:**
   - The while loop calculates the number of matches (`k`) using `func_1(n)`, which determines the number of participants who compete in the current round.
   - However, the logic inside the loop does not accurately reflect the process of moving on to the next round. Specifically, it incorrectly adds `k / 2` to the total bottles without considering the correct number of matches.

3. **Incorrect Bottles Calculation:**
   - The calculation of bottles `bo` is incorrect. It should account for the fact that each match involves two participants and one judge, requiring `2 * b + 1` bottles per match. Instead, the program incorrectly adds `b * k` and `k / 2`.

4. **Towels Calculation:**
   - The towels `to` are correctly calculated as `p * n`, but this part is not the primary issue here.

To correctly implement the problem, the following adjustments are necessary:

- Correctly calculate `k` as the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.
- Correctly simulate the rounds and calculate the number of matches and bottles.
- Ensure the logic accounts for the correct number of matches and bottles in each round.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
(n, b, p) = map(int, input().split())

bo = 0
to = p * n

while n > 1:
    k = 1 << (n.bit_length() - 1)  # Find the largest power of 2 <= n
    bo += 2 * b * k + k  # Each match requires 2 * b bottles for participants and 1 for the judge
    n -= k // 2  # Update the number of participants

print(bo, to)
```

This version correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
