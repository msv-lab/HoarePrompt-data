You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A tennis tournament with n participants is running. The participants are playing by an olympic system, so the winners move on and the losers drop out.

The tournament takes place in the following way (below, m is the number of the participants of the current round):

  * let k be the maximal power of the number 2 such that k ≤ m, 
  * k participants compete in the current round and a half of them passes to the next round, the other m - k participants pass to the next round directly, 
  * when only one participant remains, the tournament finishes. 



Each match requires b bottles of water for each participant and one bottle for the judge. Besides p towels are given to each participant for the whole tournament.

Find the number of bottles and towels needed for the tournament.

Note that it's a tennis tournament so in each match two participants compete (one of them will win and the other will lose).

Input

The only line contains three integers n, b, p (1 ≤ n, b, p ≤ 500) — the number of participants and the parameters described in the problem statement.

Output

Print two integers x and y — the number of bottles and towels need for the tournament.

Examples

Input

5 2 3


Output

20 15


Input

8 2 4


Output

35 32

Note

In the first example will be three rounds:

  1. in the first round will be two matches and for each match 5 bottles of water are needed (two for each of the participants and one for the judge), 
  2. in the second round will be only one match, so we need another 5 bottles of water, 
  3. in the third round will also be only one match, so we need another 5 bottles of water. 



So in total we need 20 bottles of water.

In the second example no participant will move on to some round directly.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
(n, b, p) = map(int, raw_input().split())
potencias = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512]
(bo, to) = (0, p * n)
while n > 1:
    k = func_1(n)
    bo += b * k
    print(n, k, bo)
    n = n - k / 2
    bo += k / 2
    if k == 1:
        break
print(bo, to)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the number of participants (1 ≤ x ≤ 500), and b and p are integers representing the number of bottles of water per participant per match and the number of towels per participant (1 ≤ b, p ≤ 500).
def func_1(x):
    for i in range(10):
        if potencias[i] > x:
            return potencias[i - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is an integer representing the number of participants, `b` and `p` are integers representing the number of bottles of water per participant per match and the number of towels per participant. If `potencias[9]` is greater than `x`, the function returns `potencias[8]`. Otherwise, the function returns `potencias[9]` if it is less than or equal to `x`, and if none of these conditions are met, the function returns `potencias[0]` if it is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise no specific value is returned.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
