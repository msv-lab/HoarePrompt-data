Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic for determining the number of bottles and towels needed for the tournament. Specifically, the function `func_1` is used to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to the number of participants, but the logic in the main part of the code does not accurately reflect the rules of the Olympic system described in the problem.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Matches**: The while loop and the logic inside it do not correctly simulate the matches in each round. The number of matches in each round should be `k` (where `k` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to the number of participants in that round), and each match involves 2 participants plus one judge, requiring `2 * b + 1` bottles of water.

2. **Towel Calculation**: The towel calculation is only done once at the start, which is incorrect because towels are given to each participant for the entire tournament, regardless of how many rounds they play in.

To fix these issues, the code should calculate the number of matches and the corresponding bottles of water for each round and sum them up. Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def tournament_water_and_towels(n, b, p):
    total_bottles = 0
    total_towels = p * n
    
    while n > 1:
        k = max(1, 2 ** (n.bit_length() - 1))  # Find the largest power of 2 <= n
        total_bottles += (2 * k + 1) * b  # Bottles for k matches
        n = (n - k) // 2 + k // 2  # Update number of participants for the next round
    
    return total_bottles, total_towels

# Example usage
(n, b, p) = map(int, input().split())
print(tournament_water_and_towels(n, b, p))
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of bottles and towels is calculated correctly according to the problem description.
