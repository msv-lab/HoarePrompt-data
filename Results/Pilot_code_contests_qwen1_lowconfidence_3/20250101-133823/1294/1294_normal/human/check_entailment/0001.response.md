Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of bottles of water needed for the tournament. Specifically, the calculation of `k` in the function `func_1(x)` is flawed. The function `func_1(x)` returns the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x`, but the logic inside the loop does not handle this correctly for all values of `x`.

For example, consider the input `(n, b, p) = (5, 2, 3)`. According to the problem description, the tournament should proceed as follows:

1. First round: 2 matches (4 participants competing, 2 winners advancing)
   - Water needed: 2 * 2 * 2 + 2 * 1 = 10 (for 2 matches, each match needs 5 bottles of water)
2. Second round: 1 match (2 participants competing, 1 winner advancing)
   - Water needed: 2 * 1 * 2 + 1 * 1 = 5 (for 1 match, each match needs 5 bottles of water)
3. Total water needed: 10 + 5 = 15

However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of matches in the first round as 2 (which should be 4/2 = 2 matches, but the function `func_1` returns 2 without correctly halving the participants). This leads to an incorrect total of 20 bottles of water instead of the correct 15.

The issue arises because the function `func_1(x)` should return the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x`, but the loop in `func_1` does not properly handle this. For instance, `func_1(5)` should return 4, but the current implementation returns 2.

To fix this, the function `func_1(x)` should correctly return the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x` by properly halving the participants until the correct value is found.
