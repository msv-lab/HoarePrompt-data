You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A tennis tournament with n participants is running. The participants are playing by an olympic system, so the winners move on and the losers drop out.

The tournament takes place in the following way (below, m is the number of the participants of the current round):

  * let k be the maximal power of the number 2 such that k ≤ m, 
  * k participants compete in the current round and a half of them passes to the next round, the other m - k participants pass to the next round directly, 
  * when only one participant remains, the tournament finishes. 



Each match requires b bottles of water for each participant and one bottle for the judge. Besides p towels are given to each participant for the whole tournament.

Find the number of bottles and towels needed for the tournament.

Note that it's a tennis tournament so in each match two participants compete (one of them will win and the other will lose).

Input

The only line contains three integers n, b, p (1 ≤ n, b, p ≤ 500) — the number of participants and the parameters described in the problem statement.

Output

Print two integers x and y — the number of bottles and towels need for the tournament.

Examples

Input

5 2 3


Output

20 15


Input

8 2 4


Output

35 32

Note

In the first example will be three rounds:

  1. in the first round will be two matches and for each match 5 bottles of water are needed (two for each of the participants and one for the judge), 
  2. in the second round will be only one match, so we need another 5 bottles of water, 
  3. in the third round will also be only one match, so we need another 5 bottles of water. 



So in total we need 20 bottles of water.

In the second example no participant will move on to some round directly.
Program:
```
(n, b, p) = map(int, raw_input().split())
potencias = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512]
(bo, to) = (0, p * n)
while n > 1:
    k = func_1(n)
    bo += b * k
    print(n, k, bo)
    n = n - k / 2
    bo += k / 2
    if k == 1:
        break
print(bo, to)

def func_1(x):
    for i in range(10):
        if potencias[i] > x:
            return potencias[i - 1]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of bottles of water needed for the tournament. Specifically, the calculation of `k` in the function `func_1(x)` is flawed. The function `func_1(x)` returns the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x`, but the logic inside the loop does not handle this correctly for all values of `x`.

For example, consider the input `(n, b, p) = (5, 2, 3)`. According to the problem description, the tournament should proceed as follows:

1. First round: 2 matches (4 participants competing, 2 winners advancing)
   - Water needed: 2 * 2 * 2 + 2 * 1 = 10 (for 2 matches, each match needs 5 bottles of water)
2. Second round: 1 match (2 participants competing, 1 winner advancing)
   - Water needed: 2 * 1 * 2 + 1 * 1 = 5 (for 1 match, each match needs 5 bottles of water)
3. Total water needed: 10 + 5 = 15

However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of matches in the first round as 2 (which should be 4/2 = 2 matches, but the function `func_1` returns 2 without correctly halving the participants). This leads to an incorrect total of 20 bottles of water instead of the correct 15.

The issue arises because the function `func_1(x)` should return the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x`, but the loop in `func_1` does not properly handle this. For instance, `func_1(5)` should return 4, but the current implementation returns 2.

To fix this, the function `func_1(x)` should correctly return the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x` by properly halving the participants until the correct value is found.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, b, p) = map(int, raw_input().split())
potencias = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512]
(bo, to) = (0, p * n)
while n > 1:
    k = func_1(n)
    bo += b * k
    print(n, k, bo)
    n = n - k / 2
    bo += k / 2
    if k == 1:
        break
print(bo, to)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the number of participants (1 ≤ x ≤ 500), and b and p are integers representing the number of bottles of water per participant per match and the number of towels per participant (1 ≤ b, p ≤ 500).
def func_1(x):
    for i in range(10):
        if potencias[i] > x:
            return potencias[i - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is an integer representing the number of participants, `b` and `p` are integers representing the number of bottles of water per participant per match and the number of towels per participant. If `potencias[9]` is greater than `x`, the function returns `potencias[8]`. Otherwise, the function returns `potencias[9]` if it is less than or equal to `x`, and if none of these conditions are met, the function returns `potencias[0]` if it is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise no specific value is returned.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` representing the number of participants, with the constraint \(1 \leq x \leq 500\). It then iterates through the indices of an array `potencias` (not defined in the snippet but assumed to be relevant based on the cases provided). If `potencias[i]` is greater than `x`, the function returns `potencias[i - 1]`. If `i` is within the bounds of the array and `potencias[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `x`, the function returns `potencias[i - 1]`. If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns `potencias[9]` if it is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise it returns `potencias[0]` if it is less than or equal to `x`. If `potencias[9]` is not greater than `x`, the function will eventually return `potencias[0]`. If `potencias[0]` is also not less than or equal to `x`, the function will not return anything.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
