Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of bottles needed for the tournament. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the number of matches `k` is determined and used to calculate the number of bottles. 

In the given program, `func_1(n)` is intended to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. However, the implementation of `func_1` is incorrect because it uses a fixed list of powers of 2 (`potencias`) which does not cover all possible values of `n` within the given constraints. Additionally, the logic to calculate the number of bottles is flawed. For each match, the number of bottles required is `b * 2 + 1` (2 bottles per participant plus 1 for the judge). The current implementation incorrectly adds only `b * k` and `k / 2` without accounting for the actual number of matches.

For example, consider the input `(5, 2, 3)`. The program calculates the number of matches as follows:
- In the first round, `k = 4`, but this is incorrect because there are only 5 participants, so `k` should be 2 (2 matches).
- The program would incorrectly calculate the number of bottles for the first round as `b * 4 = 8`, instead of `2 * 2 + 1 + 2 * 2 + 1 = 9`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and thus the correctness is **False**.
