Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of bottles needed for the tournament. Specifically, the calculation of `bo` (bottles) is flawed. The variable `k` represents the number of participants in the current round, but the way `bo` is incremented does not account for the correct number of matches played in each round.

Let's break down the issue:
- In each round, `k` participants compete, and half of them (rounded up) move to the next round.
- For each match, `b + 1` bottles are required (since each of the two participants needs `b` bottles and the judge needs 1 bottle).
- The current implementation adds `b * k` to `bo`, which is incorrect because it does not consider that only half of the participants in `k` actually compete in a match.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, b, p) = map(int, input().split())
bo = 0
to = p * n

while n > 1:
    k = func_1(n)
    bo += (k // 2) * (b + 1)
    n = k // 2

print(bo, to)

def func_1(x):
    for i in range(10):
        if (1 << i) > x:
            return (1 << (i - 1))
```

In this corrected version:
- `bo += (k // 2) * (b + 1)` correctly calculates the number of bottles needed for the matches in the current round.
- The rest of the logic remains the same.

Given the above explanation, the original program does not correctly calculate the number of bottles needed, hence the output is incorrect for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
