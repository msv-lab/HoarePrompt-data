Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` indeed has issues in determining the correct power of 2 for a given number of participants. Moreover, the logic for calculating the number of bottles required is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly account for the number of matches in each round. For instance, in the first round, with 5 participants, the correct number of matches should be 2, but the code incorrectly calculates it as 4. This leads to an incorrect calculation of the number of bottles needed. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and the original assessment of correctness being **False** is valid.
