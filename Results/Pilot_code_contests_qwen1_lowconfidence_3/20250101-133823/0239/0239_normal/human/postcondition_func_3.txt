The function `func_4` takes an integer `i` as input, which represents the index of a domino in the list `dom`. It performs a binary search within the sublist of `dom` starting from index `i` to find a pivot point `m` such that `dom[m][0]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `x + h`, where `x` and `h` are the coordinates of the domino at index `i`. After finding this pivot point, it calls another function `func_3` with the arguments `(1, 0, n, i, e)`, where `n` is one more than `i`, and `i` and `e` are the original values of `i` and `n` respectively. The function returns the result of this call to `func_3`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `dom` is empty or `i` is out of bounds, the function will raise an IndexError.
- If `dom[i][0]` is already greater than or equal to `x + h`, the binary search might terminate prematurely, but since the code only updates `s` and `e` based on comparisons, it will still work correctly.

Missing functionality:
- The code does not handle the case where `dom` is empty or `i` is out of bounds, which would cause an error. Therefore, it is necessary to add error handling for these cases before proceeding with the binary search.
- There is no action taken if the binary search loop terminates without finding a suitable pivot point `m` that satisfies the condition `dom[m][0] >= x + h`. This should be handled to ensure the function always returns a valid result.
