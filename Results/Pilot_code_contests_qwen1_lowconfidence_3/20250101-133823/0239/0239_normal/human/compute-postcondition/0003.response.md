To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop and the current state of the variables.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while e - s > 1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Current state before the loop:
- `dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing the coordinate (x) and height (h) of a domino.
- `i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(dom), indicating the index of the domino being processed.
- `x` is the first integer from `dom[i]`.
- `h` is the second integer from `dom[i]`.
- `s` is equal to `i`.
- `e` is equal to `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `e - s > 1` must be true. This means that the difference between `e` and `s` must be greater than 1.

Given that `s` is equal to `i` and `e` is equal to `n`, the condition simplifies to checking if `n - i > 1`.

Since `i` is an integer indicating the index of the domino being processed, and `n` is some other integer, we need to ensure that `n` is at least `i + 2` for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `e` (which is `n`) must be greater than `s` (which is `i`) by at least 2.

So, the updated state right before the loop should be:
State: **`dom` is a list of lists, `i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(dom), `x` is the first integer from `dom[i]`, `h` is the second integer from `dom[i]`, `s` is equal to `i`, `e` is equal to `n` and `n` must be greater than `i` by at least 2**.
