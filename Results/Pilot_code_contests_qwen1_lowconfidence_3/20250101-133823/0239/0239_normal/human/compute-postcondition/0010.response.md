Postcondition: ***`dom` is a list of lists, `i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq i < \text{len(dom)}\), `x` is the first integer from `dom[i]`, `h` is the second integer from `dom[i]`, `s` is equal to \((n + i) / 2\), `e` is equal to `n`, `m` is equal to \(\frac{n + i}{2}\), and `n` is greater than `i` by at least 2. If `dom[m][0]` is less than `x + h`, then `dom[m][0]` is less than `x + h`. Otherwise, `dom[m][0]` is greater than or equal to `x + h`. Additionally, the value of `m` is printed in both cases.***
