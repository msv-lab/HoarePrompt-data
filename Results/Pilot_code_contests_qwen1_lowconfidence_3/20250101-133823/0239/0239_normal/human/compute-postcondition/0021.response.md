The code `e = m` assigns the value of `m` to `e`. From the initial state, we know that `m` is equal to `int((3 * n + i) / 4)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dom` is a list of lists, `i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq i < \text{len(dom)}\), `x` is the first integer from `dom[i]`, `h` is the second integer from `dom[i]`, `s` is equal to \(\frac{n + i}{2}\), `e` is now equal to `int\left(\frac{3n + i}{4}\right)\), `m` is equal to `int\left(\frac{3n + i}{4}\right)\), and `n` is greater than `i` by at least 2.**
