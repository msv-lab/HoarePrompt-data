Postcondition: **`dom` is a list of lists, `i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(dom), `x` is the first integer from `dom[i]`, `h` is the second integer from `dom[i]`, `s` is equal to `i`, `e` is equal to `n`, `m` is equal to `(n + i) / 2`, `n` is greater than `i` by at least 2; the value of `m` is printed, and `dom[m][0]` is less than `x + h`.**
