Postcondition: ***`dom` is a list of lists, `i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq i < \text{len(dom)}\), `x` is the first integer from `dom[i]`, `h` is the second integer from `dom[i]`, `s` is equal to \(\frac{n + i}{2}\), `e` is either equal to `n` or `int\left(\frac{3n + i}{4}\right)\), `m` is equal to `int\left(\frac{3n + i}{4}\right)\), and `n` is greater than `i` by at least 2. If `dom[m][0] < x + h`, then `m` is printed. Otherwise, `e` is updated to `int\left(\frac{3n + i}{4}\right)` and `m` is printed.***
