The code `e = m` assigns the value of `m` to `e`. According to the initial state, `m` is equal to \(\frac{n + i}{2}\). Since no other variables are affected by this code, the output state will reflect this assignment.

Output State: **`dom` is a list of lists, `i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq i < \text{len(dom)}\), `x` is the first integer from `dom[i]`, `h` is the second integer from `dom[i]`, `s` is equal to \((n + i) / 2\), `e` is equal to \(\frac{n + i}{2}\), `m` is equal to \(\frac{n + i}{2}\), and `n` is greater than `i` by at least 2.**
