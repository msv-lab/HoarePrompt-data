Postcondition: ***`dom` is a list of lists, `i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq i < \text{len(dom)}\), `x` is the first integer from `dom[i]`, `h` is the second integer from `dom[i]`, `s` is equal to \(\frac{n + i}{2}\), `e` is equal to `n`, `m` is equal to \(\frac{n + i}{2}\), and `n` is greater than `i` by at least 2; `m` is printed as \(\frac{n + i}{2}\), and the program continues with the condition that `dom[m][0]` is either less than `x + h` or not, depending on the if-else branch executed.***
