The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `i`. `i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq i < \text{len}(dom)\). The function does not directly return a value but rather calls another function `func_3` with specific parameters derived from the initial conditions.

Specifically, the function `func_4` returns the result of the function call `func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)`, where:
- `n` is greater than `i` by at least 2.
- `i` is the same as the input parameter `i`.
- `e` is defined in the initial state but not specified here.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept an integer `i` and return the result of calling `func_3` with the specified parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `i`, returns the result of the function call `func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)`, where `n` is greater than `i` by at least 2, and `i` and `e` are as defined in the initial state.**
