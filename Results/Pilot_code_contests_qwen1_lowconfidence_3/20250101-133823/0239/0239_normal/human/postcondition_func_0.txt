The function `func_1()` reads a single line of input from the standard input (stdin), splits this line into a list of strings based on whitespace, and returns this list. This function accepts no parameters. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the provided code, but generally, if the input line is empty, the returned list will also be empty. No additional functionality or checks are present in the code, so the function does not handle cases such as non-whitespace delimiters or multi-line inputs.
