The function `func_3` is designed to find the maximum value within a specified query range `[l, r]` using a segment tree. It accepts parameters `x`, `s`, `e`, `l`, and `r`, where `x` is the index of the segment tree node, `s` and `e` are the start and end indices of the segment represented by the node, `l` and `r` define the query range, and `seg` is the segment tree array. The function returns the maximum value within the query range `[l, r]`.

If the segment represented by the node is completely outside the query range (i.e., `s >= r` or `e <= l`), the function returns 0. If the segment represented by the node is fully within the query range (i.e., `s == l` and `e == r` or `e - s < 2`), the function returns the value at `seg[x]`. Otherwise, the function recursively queries the left and right children of the current node and returns the maximum value between these two results.
