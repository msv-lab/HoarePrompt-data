Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the input list `dom` is empty or when the index `i` is out of bounds. According to the problem description, the function `func_4` should handle these cases, but it does not. Additionally, the binary search in `func_4` might terminate without finding a suitable pivot point `m` that satisfies the condition `dom[m][0] >= x + h`, leading to an incorrect result. This missing functionality means the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
