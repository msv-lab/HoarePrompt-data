You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya is interested in arranging dominoes. He is fed up with common dominoes and he uses the dominoes of different heights. He put n dominoes on the table along one axis, going from left to right. Every domino stands perpendicular to that axis so that the axis passes through the center of its base. The i-th domino has the coordinate xi and the height hi. Now Vasya wants to learn for every domino, how many dominoes will fall if he pushes it to the right. Help him do that. 

Consider that a domino falls if it is touched strictly above the base. In other words, the fall of the domino with the initial coordinate x and height h leads to the fall of all dominoes on the segment [x + 1, x + h - 1].

<image>

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) which is the number of dominoes. Then follow n lines containing two integers xi and hi ( - 108 ≤ xi ≤ 108, 2 ≤ hi ≤ 108) each, which are the coordinate and height of every domino. No two dominoes stand on one point.

Output

Print n space-separated numbers zi — the number of dominoes that will fall if Vasya pushes the i-th domino to the right (including the domino itself).

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1()` reads a single line of input from the standard input (stdin), splits this line into a list of strings based on whitespace, and returns this list. This function accepts no parameters. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the provided code, but generally, if the input line is empty, the returned list will also be empty. No additional functionality or checks are present in the code, so the function does not handle cases such as non-whitespace delimiters or multi-line inputs.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(i, val, s, e, x):
    seg[x] = max(seg[x], val)
    if e - s < 2:
        return
    m = (e + s) / 2
    if i < m:
        func_2(i, val, s, m, 2 * x)
    else:
        func_2(i, val, m, e, 2 * x + 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts five parameters: `i`, `val`, `s`, `e`, and `x`. After executing, it updates the segment tree `seg` by setting `seg[x]` to the maximum value between its current value and `val`. This operation is performed recursively based on the value of `i` relative to the midpoint `m` of the segment defined by `s` and `e`. Specifically:

- If `i < m`, the function updates the left child segment (`2 * x`) of the current node.
- If `i ≥ m`, the function updates the right child segment (`2 * x + 1`) of the current node.

The function does not return any value. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the segment tree `seg` has been updated to reflect the maximum values of `val` for each relevant segment.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(x, s, e, l, r):
    print('infind %d %d-%d %d-%d' % (x, s, e, l, r))
    if s >= r or e <= l:
        return 0
    print('passed')
    if s == l and e == r or e - s < 2:
        print('wtf? %d' % seg[x])
        return seg[x]
    m = (e + s) / 2
    return max(func_3(2 * x, s, m, l, min(r, m)), func_3(2 * x + 1, m, e, max(m, l), r))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` is designed to find the maximum value within a specified query range `[l, r]` using a segment tree. It accepts parameters `x`, `s`, `e`, `l`, and `r`, where `x` is the index of the segment tree node, `s` and `e` are the start and end indices of the segment represented by the node, `l` and `r` define the query range, and `seg` is the segment tree array. The function returns the maximum value within the query range `[l, r]`.

If the segment represented by the node is completely outside the query range (i.e., `s >= r` or `e <= l`), the function returns 0. If the segment represented by the node is fully within the query range (i.e., `s == l` and `e == r` or `e - s < 2`), the function returns the value at `seg[x]`. Otherwise, the function recursively queries the left and right children of the current node and returns the maximum value between these two results.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(i):
    [x, h] = dom[i][0:2]
    s = i
    e = n
    while e - s > 1:
        m = int((e + s) / 2)
        print('bs %d' % m)
        if dom[m][0] < x + h:
            s = m
        else:
            e = m
    print('find %d %d - %d %d' % (i, e, x, h))
    return func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` takes an integer `i` as input, which represents the index of a domino in the list `dom`. It performs a binary search within the sublist of `dom` starting from index `i` to find a pivot point `m` such that `dom[m][0]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `x + h`, where `x` and `h` are the coordinates of the domino at index `i`. After finding this pivot point, it calls another function `func_3` with the arguments `(1, 0, n, i, e)`, where `n` is one more than `i`, and `i` and `e` are the original values of `i` and `n` respectively. The function returns the result of this call to `func_3`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `dom` is empty or `i` is out of bounds, the function will raise an IndexError.
- If `dom[i][0]` is already greater than or equal to `x + h`, the binary search might terminate prematurely, but since the code only updates `s` and `e` based on comparisons, it will still work correctly.

Missing functionality:
- The code does not handle the case where `dom` is empty or `i` is out of bounds, which would cause an error. Therefore, it is necessary to add error handling for these cases before proceeding with the binary search.
- There is no action taken if the binary search loop terminates without finding a suitable pivot point `m` that satisfies the condition `dom[m][0] >= x + h`. This should be handled to ensure the function always returns a valid result.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
