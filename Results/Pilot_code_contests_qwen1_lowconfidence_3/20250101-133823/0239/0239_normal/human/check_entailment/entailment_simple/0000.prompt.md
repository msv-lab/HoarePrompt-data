You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vasya is interested in arranging dominoes. He is fed up with common dominoes and he uses the dominoes of different heights. He put n dominoes on the table along one axis, going from left to right. Every domino stands perpendicular to that axis so that the axis passes through the center of its base. The i-th domino has the coordinate xi and the height hi. Now Vasya wants to learn for every domino, how many dominoes will fall if he pushes it to the right. Help him do that. 

Consider that a domino falls if it is touched strictly above the base. In other words, the fall of the domino with the initial coordinate x and height h leads to the fall of all dominoes on the segment [x + 1, x + h - 1].

<image>

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) which is the number of dominoes. Then follow n lines containing two integers xi and hi ( - 108 ≤ xi ≤ 108, 2 ≤ hi ≤ 108) each, which are the coordinate and height of every domino. No two dominoes stand on one point.

Output

Print n space-separated numbers zi — the number of dominoes that will fall if Vasya pushes the i-th domino to the right (including the domino itself).

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

dom = []
n = int(func_1()[0])
for i in range(n):
    dom.append(func_1())
    dom[i].append(i)
    for j in range(len(dom[i])):
        dom[i][j] = int(dom[i][j])
dom.sort()
seg = 4 * n * [0]
res = n * [0]
inf = 1000 * 1000 * 100 + 10
indx = n
while indx > 0:
    indx -= 1
    res[indx] = [dom[indx][2], max(indx + 1, func_4(indx)), indx]
    print('res %d: %d' % (indx, res[indx][1]))
    func_2(indx, res[indx][1], 0, n, 1)
    log = ''
    for x in seg:
        log += str(x) + ' '
    print(log)
print(res)
res.sort()
out = ''
for i in range(n):
    out += str(res[i][1] - res[i][2]) + ' '
print(out)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the provided function signature match those in the problem description. However, based on the problem context, the function likely reads input. The precondition can be described as follows:
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings obtained from reading a line of input and splitting it by whitespace

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 1 ≤ i ≤ n, val is an integer representing the number of dominoes that will fall, s and e are integers representing the start and end indices of a segment in a segment tree, and x is an integer representing the current node index in the segment tree.
def func_2(i, val, s, e, x):
    seg[x] = max(seg[x], val)
    if (e - s < 2) :
        return

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `val` is an integer representing the number of dominoes that will fall, `s` and `e` are integers representing the start and end indices of a segment in a segment tree, `x` is an integer representing the current node index in the segment tree, and `seg[x]` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `val`. The difference between `e` and `s` is greater than or equal to 2
    m = (e + s) / 2
    if (i < m) :
        func_2(i, val, s, m, 2 * x)

If `i` is less than `m`, `seg[2 * x]` is updated. Otherwise, `seg[x]` is updated.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the index of the segment tree node, s and e are integers representing the start and end indices of the segment represented by the node, l and r are integers representing the query range, and seg is a list or array storing the segment tree values.

The start index `s` is greater than or equal to the query range start `l` and the end index `e` is less than or equal to the query range end `r`, but they do not satisfy the condition `s == l and e == r` or `e - s < 2`.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: dom is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing the coordinate (x) and height (h) of a domino. i is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(dom), indicating the index of the domino being processed.

The final value of `m` is the pivot point in the last comparison that caused the loop to terminate, ensuring that `dom[s][0]` is less than or equal to `x + h` and `dom[e][0]` is greater than or equal to `x + h`.
    print('find %d %d - %d %d' % (i, e, x, h))

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
