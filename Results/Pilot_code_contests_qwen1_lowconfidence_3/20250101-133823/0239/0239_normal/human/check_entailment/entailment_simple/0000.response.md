Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not correctly compute the number of dominoes that will fall if a given domino is pushed to the right. Here's why:

1. **Segment Tree Usage**:
   - The segment tree is initialized with `4 * n * [0]`, which suggests that the segment tree might not be used correctly to solve the problem. The segment tree is intended to help efficiently find the maximum value of dominoes that could fall, but the implementation seems overly complex and not aligned with the typical use cases of segment trees for this type of problem.

2. **Binary Search for Finding Fall Range**:
   - The function `func_4(i)` uses binary search to find the range of dominoes that could be affected by pushing the `i`-th domino. However, the binary search logic seems to have issues. It checks whether `dom[m][0] < x + h` to decide the next step, which might not correctly identify the fall range. The binary search should ensure that all dominoes in the range `[x + 1, x + h - 1]` are considered, but the current implementation does not guarantee this.

3. **Updating Segment Tree**:
   - The function `func_2(i, val, s, e, x)` updates the segment tree with the maximum value of dominoes that fall when a domino at position `i` is pushed. However, the segment tree is not used to efficiently update or query the ranges of falling dominoes as required. Instead, the segment tree seems to be updated in a manner that doesn't reflect the actual logic needed to solve the problem.

4. **Resolving the Fall Count**:
   - After processing each domino, the program attempts to resolve the fall count using a segment tree. However, the segment tree operations (`func_3`) are not correctly implemented to resolve the fall count for each domino. The segment tree queries and updates are not aligning with the problem requirements.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Use a more straightforward approach to determine the fall range for each domino.
- Efficiently calculate the number of dominoes that fall due to the push using a sweep line algorithm or similar efficient method.
- Ensure that the segment tree (if used) is correctly updated and queried to resolve the fall count.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the number of dominoes that will fall if pushed to the right. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
