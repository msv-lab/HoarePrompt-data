Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where `dom` is empty or `i` is out of bounds, which would cause an `IndexError`. Additionally, the binary search in `func_4` might terminate prematurely without finding a suitable pivot point `m` that satisfies the condition `dom[m][0] >= x + h`, and there is no action taken to handle this scenario. These issues mean that the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
