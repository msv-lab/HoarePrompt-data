Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code seems to implement a segment tree to solve the problem, but it does not fully address the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the segment tree functions `func_2` and `func_3` are designed for range queries and updates, but the main function `func_4` does not correctly handle the logic required to determine how many dominoes will fall if a given domino is pushed to the right.

Here are some issues:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Range Queries**: The function `func_3` attempts to query the segment tree, but it does not properly handle the range queries to count the number of dominoes that will fall.
2. **Missing Logic for Updating the Segment Tree**: The function `func_2` is used to update the segment tree, but it does not correctly propagate the updates to cover the entire segment of falling dominoes.
3. **Inadequate Calculation of Falling Dominoes**: The function `func_4` does not correctly calculate the number of dominoes that will fall if a given domino is pushed to the right. It seems to be attempting a binary search to find the relevant segment, but the logic for updating and querying the segment tree is incomplete.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to:
- Implement a segment tree to keep track of the maximum height of dominoes that can fall.
- Use a binary search to find the range of dominoes that will fall when a specific domino is pushed.
- Update the segment tree appropriately to reflect the falling dominoes.

Given these issues, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description, hence the correctness is **False**.
