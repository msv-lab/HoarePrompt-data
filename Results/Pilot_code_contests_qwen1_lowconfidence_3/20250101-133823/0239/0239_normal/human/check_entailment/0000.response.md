Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the program uses a segment tree approach, but it does not handle the logic for determining how many dominoes will fall when a domino is pushed to the right. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are related to segment tree operations, but they are not used to solve the problem as described.

The main issue is in the function `func_4`, which is supposed to determine how many dominoes will fall if the i-th domino is pushed to the right. However, the logic inside this function does not correctly calculate the range of dominoes that will fall. Instead of properly finding the range of dominoes that will be affected by the push, the function uses binary search to find the position where the next domino starts after the current domino's end position. This approach does not correctly account for the falling sequence of dominoes.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
10 10
15 5
20 10
25 5
```

The correct output should be:

```
4 1 3 1
```

However, the given program will produce incorrect results because it does not properly determine the range of dominoes that will fall when a domino is pushed.
