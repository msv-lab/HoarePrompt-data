Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle the case where the input list `dom` is empty. According to the problem description, the input consists of `n` lines, each containing the coordinates and height of a domino. However, the code does not check if `dom` is empty before proceeding with the operations. If `dom` is empty, the binary search in `func_4` will fail because `dom` has no elements, leading to an incorrect result. Additionally, the code assumes that `dom` will always be non-empty, but this assumption is not checked or handled gracefully.

For example, if the input is:
```
0
```
or
```
1
-100 10
```

The code will attempt to perform operations on an empty or partially initialized list, which will lead to incorrect results or errors. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
