You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya is interested in arranging dominoes. He is fed up with common dominoes and he uses the dominoes of different heights. He put n dominoes on the table along one axis, going from left to right. Every domino stands perpendicular to that axis so that the axis passes through the center of its base. The i-th domino has the coordinate xi and the height hi. Now Vasya wants to learn for every domino, how many dominoes will fall if he pushes it to the right. Help him do that. 

Consider that a domino falls if it is touched strictly above the base. In other words, the fall of the domino with the initial coordinate x and height h leads to the fall of all dominoes on the segment [x + 1, x + h - 1].

<image>

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) which is the number of dominoes. Then follow n lines containing two integers xi and hi ( - 108 ≤ xi ≤ 108, 2 ≤ hi ≤ 108) each, which are the coordinate and height of every domino. No two dominoes stand on one point.

Output

Print n space-separated numbers zi — the number of dominoes that will fall if Vasya pushes the i-th domino to the right (including the domino itself).

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the provided function signature match those in the problem description. However, based on the problem context, the function likely reads input. The precondition can be described as follows:
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings obtained from reading a line of input and splitting it by whitespace
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1()` reads a single line of input from the standard input (stdin), splits this line into a list of strings based on whitespace, and returns this list. This function accepts no parameters. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the provided code, but generally, if the input line is empty, the returned list will also be empty. No additional functionality or checks are present in the code, so the function does not handle cases such as non-whitespace delimiters or multi-line inputs.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 1 ≤ i ≤ n, val is an integer representing the number of dominoes that will fall, s and e are integers representing the start and end indices of a segment in a segment tree, and x is an integer representing the current node index in the segment tree.
def func_2(i, val, s, e, x):
    seg[x] = max(seg[x], val)
    if (e - s < 2) :
        return
        #The program does not return any value
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `val` is an integer representing the number of dominoes that will fall, `s` and `e` are integers representing the start and end indices of a segment in a segment tree, `x` is an integer representing the current node index in the segment tree, and `seg[x]` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `val`. The difference between `e` and `s` is greater than or equal to 2
    m = (e + s) / 2
    if (i < m) :
        func_2(i, val, s, m, 2 * x)
    else :
        func_2(i, val, m, e, 2 * x + 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `i` is an integer such that \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `val` is an integer representing the number of dominoes that will fall, `s` and `e` are integers representing the start and end indices of a segment in a segment tree, `x` is an integer representing the current node index in the segment tree, `seg[x]` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `val`, `m` is the midpoint between `s` and `e` calculated as \((e + s) / 2\). If `i` is less than `m`, `seg[2 * x]` is updated. Otherwise, `seg[x]` is updated.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts five parameters: `i`, `val`, `s`, `e`, and `x`. After executing, it updates the segment tree `seg` by setting `seg[x]` to the maximum value between its current value and `val`. This operation is performed recursively based on the value of `i` relative to the midpoint `m` of the segment defined by `s` and `e`. Specifically:

- If `i < m`, the function updates the left child segment (`2 * x`) of the current node.
- If `i ≥ m`, the function updates the right child segment (`2 * x + 1`) of the current node.

The function does not return any value. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the segment tree `seg` has been updated to reflect the maximum values of `val` for each relevant segment.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the index of the segment tree node, s and e are integers representing the start and end indices of the segment represented by the node, l and r are integers representing the query range, and seg is a list or array storing the segment tree values.
def func_3(x, s, e, l, r):
    print('infind %d %d-%d %d-%d' % (x, s, e, l, r))
    if (s >= r or e <= l) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `x` is an integer representing the index of the segment tree node, `s` and `e` are integers representing the start and end indices of the segment represented by the node, `l` and `r` are integers representing the query range, and `seg` is a list or array storing the segment tree values. The start index `s` is less than the query range end `r` and the end index `e` is greater than the query range start `l`.
    print('passed')
    if (s == l and e == r or e - s < 2) :
        print('wtf? %d' % seg[x])
        return seg[x]
        #The program returns the value of seg[x] where x is the index of the segment tree node, s and e are the start and end indices of the segment represented by the node, and the start index s is equal to the query range start l and the end index e is equal to the query range end r, or the difference between e and s is less than 2.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `x` is an integer representing the index of the segment tree node, `s` and `e` are integers representing the start and end indices of the segment represented by the node, `l` and `r` are integers representing the query range, and `seg` is a list or array storing the segment tree values. The start index `s` is greater than or equal to the query range start `l` and the end index `e` is less than or equal to the query range end `r`, but they do not satisfy the condition `s == l and e == r` or `e - s < 2`.
    m = (e + s) / 2
    return max(func_3(2 * x, s, m, l, min(r, m)), func_3(2 * x + 1, m, e, max(m,
    l), r))
    #`The program returns the maximum value between func_3(2 * x, s, m, l, min(r, m)) and func_3(2 * x + 1, m, e, max(m, l), r)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` is designed to find the maximum value within a specified query range `[l, r]` using a segment tree. It accepts parameters `x`, `s`, `e`, `l`, and `r`, where `x` is the index of the segment tree node, `s` and `e` are the start and end indices of the segment represented by the node, `l` and `r` define the query range, and `seg` is the segment tree array. The function returns the maximum value within the query range `[l, r]`.

If the segment represented by the node is completely outside the query range (i.e., `s >= r` or `e <= l`), the function returns 0. If the segment represented by the node is fully within the query range (i.e., `s == l` and `e == r` or `e - s < 2`), the function returns the value at `seg[x]`. Otherwise, the function recursively queries the left and right children of the current node and returns the maximum value between these two results.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: dom is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing the coordinate (x) and height (h) of a domino. i is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(dom), indicating the index of the domino being processed.
def func_4(i):
    [x, h] = dom[i][0:2]
    s = i
    e = n
    while e - s > 1:
        m = int((e + s) / 2)
        
        print('bs %d' % m)
        
        if dom[m][0] < x + h:
            s = m
        else:
            e = m
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `dom` is a list of lists, `i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq i < \text{len(dom)}\), `x` is the first integer from `dom[i]`, `h` is the second integer from `dom[i]`, `s` is equal to \(\text{original } i\), `e` is equal to \(\text{original } n\), `m` is equal to \(\text{final value of } m\) after the loop completes, and `n` is greater than `i` by at least 2. The final value of `m` is the pivot point in the last comparison that caused the loop to terminate, ensuring that `dom[s][0]` is less than or equal to `x + h` and `dom[e][0]` is greater than or equal to `x + h`.
    print('find %d %d - %d %d' % (i, e, x, h))
    return func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)
    #The program returns the result of the function call `func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)` where `n` is greater than `i` by at least 2, and `i` and `e` are as defined in the initial state
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes an integer `i` as input, which represents the index of a domino in the list `dom`. It performs a binary search within the sublist of `dom` starting from index `i` to find a pivot point `m` such that `dom[m][0]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `x + h`, where `x` and `h` are the coordinates of the domino at index `i`. After finding this pivot point, it calls another function `func_3` with the arguments `(1, 0, n, i, e)`, where `n` is one more than `i`, and `i` and `e` are the original values of `i` and `n` respectively. The function returns the result of this call to `func_3`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `dom` is empty or `i` is out of bounds, the function will raise an IndexError.
- If `dom[i][0]` is already greater than or equal to `x + h`, the binary search might terminate prematurely, but since the code only updates `s` and `e` based on comparisons, it will still work correctly.

Missing functionality:
- The code does not handle the case where `dom` is empty or `i` is out of bounds, which would cause an error. Therefore, it is necessary to add error handling for these cases before proceeding with the binary search.
- There is no action taken if the binary search loop terminates without finding a suitable pivot point `m` that satisfies the condition `dom[m][0] >= x + h`. This should be handled to ensure the function always returns a valid result.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
