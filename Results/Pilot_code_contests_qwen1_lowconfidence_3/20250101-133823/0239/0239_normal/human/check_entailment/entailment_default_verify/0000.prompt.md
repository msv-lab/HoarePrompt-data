You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya is interested in arranging dominoes. He is fed up with common dominoes and he uses the dominoes of different heights. He put n dominoes on the table along one axis, going from left to right. Every domino stands perpendicular to that axis so that the axis passes through the center of its base. The i-th domino has the coordinate xi and the height hi. Now Vasya wants to learn for every domino, how many dominoes will fall if he pushes it to the right. Help him do that. 

Consider that a domino falls if it is touched strictly above the base. In other words, the fall of the domino with the initial coordinate x and height h leads to the fall of all dominoes on the segment [x + 1, x + h - 1].

<image>

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) which is the number of dominoes. Then follow n lines containing two integers xi and hi ( - 108 ≤ xi ≤ 108, 2 ≤ hi ≤ 108) each, which are the coordinate and height of every domino. No two dominoes stand on one point.

Output

Print n space-separated numbers zi — the number of dominoes that will fall if Vasya pushes the i-th domino to the right (including the domino itself).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the program uses a segment tree approach, but it does not handle the logic for determining how many dominoes will fall when a domino is pushed to the right. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are related to segment tree operations, but they are not used to solve the problem as described.

The main issue is in the function `func_4`, which is supposed to determine how many dominoes will fall if the i-th domino is pushed to the right. However, the logic inside this function does not correctly calculate the range of dominoes that will fall. Instead of properly finding the range of dominoes that will be affected by the push, the function uses binary search to find the position where the next domino starts after the current domino's end position. This approach does not correctly account for the falling sequence of dominoes.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
10 10
15 5
20 10
25 5
```

The correct output should be:

```
4 1 3 1
```

However, the given program will produce incorrect results because it does not properly determine the range of dominoes that will fall when a domino is pushed.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_4` takes an integer `i` as input, which represents the index of a domino in the list `dom`. It performs a binary search within the sublist of `dom` starting from index `i` to find a pivot point `m` such that `dom[m][0]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `x + h`, where `x` and `h` are the coordinates of the domino at index `i`. After finding this pivot point, it calls another function `func_3` with the arguments `(1, 0, n, i, e)`, where `n` is one more than `i`, and `i` and `e` are the original values of `i` and `n` respectively. The function returns the result of this call to `func_3`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `dom` is empty or `i` is out of bounds, the function will raise an IndexError.
- If `dom[i][0]` is already greater than or equal to `x + h`, the binary search might terminate prematurely, but since the code only updates `s` and `e` based on comparisons, it will still work correctly.

Missing functionality:
- The code does not handle the case where `dom` is empty or `i` is out of bounds, which would cause an error. Therefore, it is necessary to add error handling for these cases before proceeding with the binary search.
- There is no action taken if the binary search loop terminates without finding a suitable pivot point `m` that satisfies the condition `dom[m][0] >= x + h`. This should be handled to ensure the function always returns a valid result.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
