The input is provided as two lists: the first list contains n integers representing the coordinates xi of the dominoes, and the second list contains n integers representing the heights hi of the dominoes. Both lists are of the same length n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and -10^8 ≤ xi ≤ 10^8, 2 ≤ hi ≤ 10^8. No two dominoes share the same coordinate.
