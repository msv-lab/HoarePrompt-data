The function `func_2()` does not actually use the parameters `n`, `k`, and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_k` as described in the annotations. Instead, it takes positional arguments `args` and keyword arguments `kwargs`. It concatenates the string representations of the elements in `args`, separating them with `sep`, and writes the result to `file`. After writing, it appends `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')` to the output and flushes the stream if `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`. There are no actions performed on the parameters `n`, `k`, and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_k`, and the function does not return anything. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `file` contains the concatenated string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, followed by `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, `file.flush()` has been called.
