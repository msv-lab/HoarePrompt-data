Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Scenarios:**
   - The primary issue lies in the calculation of valid scenarios where Alice can answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions. The program attempts to calculate these scenarios using the `counter` list, but it does not correctly account for all possible movements Alice can make.

2. **Logic in the Loops:**
   - The nested loops in `func_1` and `func_2` do not accurately reflect the logic needed to determine valid starting and ending positions for Alice's token. Specifically, the conditions inside the loops do not correctly simulate the movement and positioning of the token to ensure Alice can answer "NO" to all questions.

3. **Handling of Token Movements:**
   - The program assumes that Alice can move the token only between adjacent cells and that she can do so before or after answering a question. However, the current implementation does not properly track these movements and their impact on the final count of valid scenarios.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **First Loop in `func_1`:**
  ```python
  for i in range(1, n + 1):
      if counter[i][0] == -1:
          res += 1
  ```
  - This loop counts the number of cells where Alice has not yet moved her token. While this is a good start, it does not account for all possible movements Alice can make.

- **Second and Third Loops in `func_1`:**
  ```python
  for i in range(1, n):
      if counter[i][0] != -1:
          if counter[i][1] != -1:
              if counter[i + 1][0] == -1 or counter[i + 1][0] > counter[i][1]:
                  res += 1
          elif counter[i + 1][0] == -1 or counter[i + 1][0] > counter[i][0]:
              res += 1
      else:
          res += 1
  ```
  - These loops attempt to count valid movements, but they do not correctly handle all possible scenarios where Alice can move her token to adjacent cells and still answer "NO" to all questions.

- **Final Loop in `func_1`:**
  ```python
  for i in range(1, n):
      if counter[i + 1][0] != -1:
          if counter[i + 1][1] != -1:
              if counter[i][0] == -1 or counter[i][0] > counter[i + 1][1]:
                  res += 1
          elif counter[i][0] == -1 or counter[i][0] > counter[i + 1][0]:
              res += 1
      else:
          res += 1
  ```
  - Similar to the previous loops, this loop does not correctly account for all valid movements and positions of the token.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to:
1. Track the positions where Alice can start and end her token movement.
2. Ensure that Alice can answer "NO" to all questions, considering all possible movements.
3. Count all valid starting and ending positions `(a, b)` where Alice can place her token and still answer "NO" to all questions.

Given the current implementation, the program does not accurately capture all valid scenarios, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is **False** according to the problem description.
