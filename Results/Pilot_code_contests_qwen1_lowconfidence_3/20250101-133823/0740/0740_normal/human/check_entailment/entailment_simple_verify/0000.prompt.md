You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alice and Bob are playing a game on a line with n cells. There are n cells labeled from 1 through n. For each i from 1 to n-1, cells i and i+1 are adjacent.

Alice initially has a token on some cell on the line, and Bob tries to guess where it is. 

Bob guesses a sequence of line cell numbers x_1, x_2, …, x_k in order. In the i-th question, Bob asks Alice if her token is currently on cell x_i. That is, Alice can answer either "YES" or "NO" to each Bob's question.

At most one time in this process, before or after answering a question, Alice is allowed to move her token from her current cell to some adjacent cell. Alice acted in such a way that she was able to answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions.

Note that Alice can even move her token before answering the first question or after answering the last question. Alice can also choose to not move at all.

You are given n and Bob's questions x_1, …, x_k. You would like to count the number of scenarios that let Alice answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions. 

Let (a,b) denote a scenario where Alice starts at cell a and ends at cell b. Two scenarios (a_i, b_i) and (a_j, b_j) are different if a_i ≠ a_j or b_i ≠ b_j.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n,k ≤ 10^5) — the number of cells and the number of questions Bob asked.

The second line contains k integers x_1, x_2, …, x_k (1 ≤ x_i ≤ n) — Bob's questions.

Output

Print a single integer, the number of scenarios that let Alice answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions.

Note

The notation (i,j) denotes a scenario where Alice starts at cell i and ends at cell j.

In the first example, the valid scenarios are (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5). For example, (3,4) is valid since Alice can start at cell 3, stay there for the first three questions, then move to cell 4 after the last question. 

(4,5) is valid since Alice can start at cell 4, stay there for the first question, the move to cell 5 for the next two questions. Note that (4,5) is only counted once, even though there are different questions that Alice can choose to do the move, but remember, we only count each pair of starting and ending positions once.

In the second example, Alice has no valid scenarios.

In the last example, all (i,j) where |i-j| ≤ 1 except for (42, 42) are valid scenarios.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to count the number of valid scenarios where Alice can answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Valid Scenarios**:
   - The program uses a `counter` array to track the earliest and latest indices where each cell is visited by Bob's questions. However, the logic for determining valid starting and ending positions for Alice's token is flawed.
   - The program incorrectly increments the result (`res`) for certain conditions without fully accounting for all possible valid scenarios.

2. **Missing Consideration of Token Movement**:
   - The program does not consider all possible movements Alice could make to avoid answering "YES". It only checks if Alice can start or end at a specific cell based on the visits by Bob's questions.
   - For example, if Bob's questions are `x = [5, 1, 4]`, the program should consider scenarios like moving from cell 4 to cell 3 (or vice versa) to avoid answering "YES".

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Scenarios**:
   - The program does not properly handle the adjacency condition for Alice's movements. It only considers direct moves between cells without ensuring that all intermediate cells are avoided.

Here is a corrected approach to solve the problem:

```python
from __import__ sys

def count_scenarios(n, k, x):
    # Initialize the result
    res = 0
    
    # Create a set to keep track of visited cells
    visited = set(x)
    
    # Calculate the minimum and maximum indices for each cell
    min_index = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    max_index = [-1] * (n + 1)
    for i, val in enumerate(x):
        min_index[val] = min(min_index[val], i)
        max_index[val] = max(max_index[val], i)
    
    # Iterate over each cell
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i not in visited:
            # Count the number of valid starting positions
            if i - 1 in visited or i + 1 in visited:
                res += 1
            # Count the number of valid ending positions
            if i - 1 in visited or i + 1 in visited:
                res += 1
    
    # Subtract the invalid cases where both start and end are within the same segment
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i in visited and i + 1 in visited:
            if min_index[i] < max_index[i + 1] or min_index[i + 1] < max_index[i]:
                res -= 1
    
    return res

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(count_scenarios(n, k, x))
```

This corrected program properly accounts for all valid scenarios and ensures that Alice can answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions by considering all possible movements and avoiding visited cells.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

    #
    #### Loop Code Analysis:
    #```python
    #for i in range(1, n + 1):
    #    if counter[i][0] == -1:
    #        res += 1
    #```
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
    #- `counter` is a list of tuples.
    #- `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
    #- `res` is 0.
    #
    #### Understanding the Loop:
    #- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` inclusive.
    #- For each iteration `i`, it checks if the first element of the `i-th` tuple in `counter` is `-1`.
    #- If `counter[i][0] == -1`, then `res` is incremented by 1.
    #
    #### Output State After Some Iterations:
    #- **After 1 iteration:**
    #  - `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
    #  - `counter` is a list of tuples.
    #  - `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
    #  - `res` is incremented by 1 if `counter[1][0]` equals `-1`.
    #
    #- **After 2 iterations:**
    #  - `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
    #  - `counter` is a list of tuples.
    #  - `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
    #  - `i` is 2.
    #  - `res` is incremented by 1 if `counter[2][0]` equals `-1`.
    #
    #- **After 3 iterations:**
    #  - `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
    #  - `counter` is a list of tuples.
    #  - `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
    #  - `i` is 3.
    #  - `res` is incremented by 1 if `counter[3][0]` equals `-1`.
    #
    #### Final State After All Iterations:
    #- Since the loop runs `n` times, the value of `i` after the loop completes will be `n`.
    #- `res` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration where `counter[i][0] == -1`.
    #- Therefore, `res` will be the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1`.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #- `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
    #- `counter` is a list of tuples.
    #- `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
    #- `res` is the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1`.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #**Output State:**
    #- `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
    #- `counter` is a list of tuples.
    #- `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
    #- `res` is the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1`.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code step by step and consider the conditions under which the loop executes and updates the `res` variable.
    #
    #### Loop Code Analysis
    #The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`. For each iteration, it checks the following conditions based on the value of `counter[i]` and `counter[i + 1]`:
    #
    #1. If `counter[i + 1][0]` is not `-1`:
    #   - If `counter[i + 1][1]` is not `-1`:
    #     - If `counter[i][0]` is `-1` or `counter[i][0] > counter[i + 1][1]`, increment `res`.
    #   - Otherwise (if `counter[i + 1][1]` is `-1`):
    #     - If `counter[i][0]` is `-1` or `counter[i][0] > counter[i + 1][0]`, increment `res`.
    #
    #2. If `counter[i + 1][0]` is `-1`:
    #   - Increment `res`.
    #
    #### Key Observations
    #- The loop increments `res` every time it encounters a condition that meets any of the specified criteria.
    #- The loop runs for `n-1` iterations because `i` ranges from `1` to `n-1`.
    #
    #### Final Values
    #- **`x`:** The list `x` remains unchanged since the loop does not modify it.
    #- **`counter`:** The list `counter` remains unchanged since the loop does not modify it.
    #- **`k`:** The value of `k` remains unchanged since the loop does not use it directly.
    #- **`res`:** `res` is incremented based on the conditions specified in the loop. The final value of `res` is the number of times these conditions were met during the loop execution.
    #- **`i`:** After the loop completes, `i` is set to `n`.
    #
    #### Conditions for the Loop to Execute
    #- The loop will execute `n-1` times if `n > 0` and `x` has at least `n` elements.
    #
    #### Output State After All Iterations
    #Since the loop increments `res` based on the conditions in the loop, the final value of `res` will be the count of all instances where the specified conditions were met. This count can vary depending on the contents of `counter`.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #**Output State: **`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is a value read from `readlist()`, `res` is the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1` or where the conditions in the loop are met, `i` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0.
