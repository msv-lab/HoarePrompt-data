You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alice and Bob are playing a game on a line with n cells. There are n cells labeled from 1 through n. For each i from 1 to n-1, cells i and i+1 are adjacent.

Alice initially has a token on some cell on the line, and Bob tries to guess where it is. 

Bob guesses a sequence of line cell numbers x_1, x_2, …, x_k in order. In the i-th question, Bob asks Alice if her token is currently on cell x_i. That is, Alice can answer either "YES" or "NO" to each Bob's question.

At most one time in this process, before or after answering a question, Alice is allowed to move her token from her current cell to some adjacent cell. Alice acted in such a way that she was able to answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions.

Note that Alice can even move her token before answering the first question or after answering the last question. Alice can also choose to not move at all.

You are given n and Bob's questions x_1, …, x_k. You would like to count the number of scenarios that let Alice answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions. 

Let (a,b) denote a scenario where Alice starts at cell a and ends at cell b. Two scenarios (a_i, b_i) and (a_j, b_j) are different if a_i ≠ a_j or b_i ≠ b_j.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n,k ≤ 10^5) — the number of cells and the number of questions Bob asked.

The second line contains k integers x_1, x_2, …, x_k (1 ≤ x_i ≤ n) — Bob's questions.

Output

Print a single integer, the number of scenarios that let Alice answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions.

Note

The notation (i,j) denotes a scenario where Alice starts at cell i and ends at cell j.

In the first example, the valid scenarios are (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5). For example, (3,4) is valid since Alice can start at cell 3, stay there for the first three questions, then move to cell 4 after the last question. 

(4,5) is valid since Alice can start at cell 4, stay there for the first question, the move to cell 5 for the next two questions. Note that (4,5) is only counted once, even though there are different questions that Alice can choose to do the move, but remember, we only count each pair of starting and ending positions once.

In the second example, Alice has no valid scenarios.

In the last example, all (i,j) where |i-j| ≤ 1 except for (42, 42) are valid scenarios.

    #
    #### Loop Code Analysis:
    #```python
    #for i in range(1, n + 1):
    #    if counter[i][0] == -1:
    #        res += 1
    #```
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
    #- `counter` is a list of tuples.
    #- `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
    #- `res` is 0.
    #
    #### Understanding the Loop:
    #- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` inclusive.
    #- For each iteration `i`, it checks if the first element of the `i-th` tuple in `counter` is `-1`.
    #- If `counter[i][0] == -1`, then `res` is incremented by 1.
    #
    #### Output State After Some Iterations:
    #- **After 1 iteration:**
    #  - `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
    #  - `counter` is a list of tuples.
    #  - `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
    #  - `res` is incremented by 1 if `counter[1][0]` equals `-1`.
    #
    #- **After 2 iterations:**
    #  - `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
    #  - `counter` is a list of tuples.
    #  - `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
    #  - `i` is 2.
    #  - `res` is incremented by 1 if `counter[2][0]` equals `-1`.
    #
    #- **After 3 iterations:**
    #  - `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
    #  - `counter` is a list of tuples.
    #  - `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
    #  - `i` is 3.
    #  - `res` is incremented by 1 if `counter[3][0]` equals `-1`.
    #
    #### Final State After All Iterations:
    #- Since the loop runs `n` times, the value of `i` after the loop completes will be `n`.
    #- `res` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration where `counter[i][0] == -1`.
    #- Therefore, `res` will be the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1`.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #- `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
    #- `counter` is a list of tuples.
    #- `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
    #- `res` is the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1`.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #**Output State:**
    #- `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
    #- `counter` is a list of tuples.
    #- `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
    #- `res` is the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1`.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code step by step and consider the conditions under which the loop executes and updates the `res` variable.
    #
    #### Loop Code Analysis
    #The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`. For each iteration, it checks the following conditions based on the value of `counter[i]` and `counter[i + 1]`:
    #
    #1. If `counter[i + 1][0]` is not `-1`:
    #   - If `counter[i + 1][1]` is not `-1`:
    #     - If `counter[i][0]` is `-1` or `counter[i][0] > counter[i + 1][1]`, increment `res`.
    #   - Otherwise (if `counter[i + 1][1]` is `-1`):
    #     - If `counter[i][0]` is `-1` or `counter[i][0] > counter[i + 1][0]`, increment `res`.
    #
    #2. If `counter[i + 1][0]` is `-1`:
    #   - Increment `res`.
    #
    #### Key Observations
    #- The loop increments `res` every time it encounters a condition that meets any of the specified criteria.
    #- The loop runs for `n-1` iterations because `i` ranges from `1` to `n-1`.
    #
    #### Final Values
    #- **`x`:** The list `x` remains unchanged since the loop does not modify it.
    #- **`counter`:** The list `counter` remains unchanged since the loop does not modify it.
    #- **`k`:** The value of `k` remains unchanged since the loop does not use it directly.
    #- **`res`:** `res` is incremented based on the conditions specified in the loop. The final value of `res` is the number of times these conditions were met during the loop execution.
    #- **`i`:** After the loop completes, `i` is set to `n`.
    #
    #### Conditions for the Loop to Execute
    #- The loop will execute `n-1` times if `n > 0` and `x` has at least `n` elements.
    #
    #### Output State After All Iterations
    #Since the loop increments `res` based on the conditions in the loop, the final value of `res` will be the count of all instances where the specified conditions were met. This count can vary depending on the contents of `counter`.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #**Output State: **`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is a value read from `readlist()`, `res` is the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1` or where the conditions in the loop are met, `i` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0.
    func_2(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `x`. It reads `n` and `k` from a list (using `readlist()`), initializes a counter list to store the first occurrence index of each integer in `x`, and then counts the number of integers in `x` that do not appear consecutively. Specifically, it increments a counter `res` for each integer that either does not appear in `x` at all or does not appear consecutively with another integer in `x`.

The function first populates the `counter` list, where each entry is a tuple containing the first occurrence index of the integer and -1 (indicating no second occurrence). Then, it iterates through the range from 1 to `n` to count how many integers in `x` do not appear consecutively or do not appear at all.

Additionally, the function includes two nested loops that further check for consecutive appearances of integers in `x` and update the `res` counter based on specific conditions. These conditions ensure that if an integer does not appear consecutively with another integer, `res` is incremented.

After executing these operations, the function calls `func_2(res)` with the final value of `res` as its argument. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` remains unchanged, `counter` is populated with the first and last occurrence indices of each integer in `x`, `k` remains unchanged, `res` contains the count of integers that do not appear consecutively or do not appear at all, and `i` is `n`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `n` or `k` are outside their respective bounds (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5).
- If `x` does not contain at least `n` elements.
- If the integers in `x` do not satisfy 1 ≤ xi ≤ n.

The function does not handle these edge cases explicitly within its current structure, leaving it to the caller to ensure valid inputs.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: `n` is an integer representing the number of cells on the line, `k` is an integer representing the number of Bob's questions, and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_k` is a list of integers representing Bob's questions where each `x_i` is between 1 and n inclusive.

    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:

If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, `file.flush()` has been called.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` does not actually use the parameters `n`, `k`, and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_k` as described in the annotations. Instead, it takes positional arguments `args` and keyword arguments `kwargs`. It concatenates the string representations of the elements in `args`, separating them with `sep`, and writes the result to `file`. After writing, it appends `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')` to the output and flushes the stream if `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`. There are no actions performed on the parameters `n`, `k`, and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_k`, and the function does not return anything. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `file` contains the concatenated string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, followed by `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, `file.flush()` has been called.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
