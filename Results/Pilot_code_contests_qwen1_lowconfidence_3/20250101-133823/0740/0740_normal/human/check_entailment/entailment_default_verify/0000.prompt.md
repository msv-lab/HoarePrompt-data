You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alice and Bob are playing a game on a line with n cells. There are n cells labeled from 1 through n. For each i from 1 to n-1, cells i and i+1 are adjacent.

Alice initially has a token on some cell on the line, and Bob tries to guess where it is. 

Bob guesses a sequence of line cell numbers x_1, x_2, …, x_k in order. In the i-th question, Bob asks Alice if her token is currently on cell x_i. That is, Alice can answer either "YES" or "NO" to each Bob's question.

At most one time in this process, before or after answering a question, Alice is allowed to move her token from her current cell to some adjacent cell. Alice acted in such a way that she was able to answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions.

Note that Alice can even move her token before answering the first question or after answering the last question. Alice can also choose to not move at all.

You are given n and Bob's questions x_1, …, x_k. You would like to count the number of scenarios that let Alice answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions. 

Let (a,b) denote a scenario where Alice starts at cell a and ends at cell b. Two scenarios (a_i, b_i) and (a_j, b_j) are different if a_i ≠ a_j or b_i ≠ b_j.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n,k ≤ 10^5) — the number of cells and the number of questions Bob asked.

The second line contains k integers x_1, x_2, …, x_k (1 ≤ x_i ≤ n) — Bob's questions.

Output

Print a single integer, the number of scenarios that let Alice answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions.

Output


299997

Note

The notation (i,j) denotes a scenario where Alice starts at cell i and ends at cell j.

In the first example, the valid scenarios are (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5). For example, (3,4) is valid since Alice can start at cell 3, stay there for the first three questions, then move to cell 4 after the last question. 

(4,5) is valid since Alice can start at cell 4, stay there for the first question, the move to cell 5 for the next two questions. Note that (4,5) is only counted once, even though there are different questions that Alice can choose to do the move, but remember, we only count each pair of starting and ending positions once.

In the second example, Alice has no valid scenarios.

In the last example, all (i,j) where |i-j| ≤ 1 except for (42, 42) are valid scenarios.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to count the number of valid scenarios where Alice can answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Valid Scenarios**:
   - The program uses a `counter` array to track the earliest and latest indices where each cell is visited by Bob's questions. However, the logic for determining valid starting and ending positions for Alice's token is flawed.
   - The program incorrectly increments the result (`res`) for certain conditions without fully accounting for all possible valid scenarios.

2. **Missing Consideration of Token Movement**:
   - The program does not consider all possible movements Alice could make to avoid answering "YES". It only checks if Alice can start or end at a specific cell based on the visits by Bob's questions.
   - For example, if Bob's questions are `x = [5, 1, 4]`, the program should consider scenarios like moving from cell 4 to cell 3 (or vice versa) to avoid answering "YES".

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Scenarios**:
   - The program does not properly handle the adjacency condition for Alice's movements. It only considers direct moves between cells without ensuring that all intermediate cells are avoided.

Here is a corrected approach to solve the problem:

```python
from __import__ sys

def count_scenarios(n, k, x):
    # Initialize the result
    res = 0
    
    # Create a set to keep track of visited cells
    visited = set(x)
    
    # Calculate the minimum and maximum indices for each cell
    min_index = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    max_index = [-1] * (n + 1)
    for i, val in enumerate(x):
        min_index[val] = min(min_index[val], i)
        max_index[val] = max(max_index[val], i)
    
    # Iterate over each cell
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i not in visited:
            # Count the number of valid starting positions
            if i - 1 in visited or i + 1 in visited:
                res += 1
            # Count the number of valid ending positions
            if i - 1 in visited or i + 1 in visited:
                res += 1
    
    # Subtract the invalid cases where both start and end are within the same segment
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i in visited and i + 1 in visited:
            if min_index[i] < max_index[i + 1] or min_index[i + 1] < max_index[i]:
                res -= 1
    
    return res

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(count_scenarios(n, k, x))
```

This corrected program properly accounts for all valid scenarios and ensures that Alice can answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions by considering all possible movements and avoiding visited cells.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2()` does not actually use the parameters `n`, `k`, and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_k` as described in the annotations. Instead, it takes positional arguments `args` and keyword arguments `kwargs`. It concatenates the string representations of the elements in `args`, separating them with `sep`, and writes the result to `file`. After writing, it appends `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')` to the output and flushes the stream if `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`. There are no actions performed on the parameters `n`, `k`, and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_k`, and the function does not return anything. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `file` contains the concatenated string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, followed by `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, `file.flush()` has been called.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
