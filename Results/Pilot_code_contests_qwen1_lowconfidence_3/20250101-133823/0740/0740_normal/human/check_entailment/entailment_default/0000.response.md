Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` attempts to count the number of scenarios where Alice can answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions without moving her token. However, the implementation has several issues:

1. The function `func_1` uses a `counter` list to track the first and last occurrence of each cell number in Bob's questions. While this conceptually makes sense, the logic for updating and using this counter is flawed. The counter should help determine if Alice can avoid answering "YES" to any of Bob's questions by staying in adjacent cells, but the current implementation does not accurately reflect this.

2. The function `func_2` is not used to solve the problem. It simply prints the value passed to it, which is irrelevant to the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, the algorithm needs to consider the following:
- For each cell, determine if Alice can avoid answering "YES" by staying in that cell or moving to an adjacent cell.
- Count the number of valid starting and ending positions (scenarios) where Alice can answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions.

Given the current implementation, it fails to accurately count these scenarios, leading to incorrect results. For instance, in the first example, the code incorrectly counts the number of valid scenarios without properly accounting for the movement constraints.
