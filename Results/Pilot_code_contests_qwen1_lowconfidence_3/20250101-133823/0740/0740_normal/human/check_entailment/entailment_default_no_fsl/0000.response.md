Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not accurately count the number of valid scenarios where Alice can answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions.

Here is a detailed explanation of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Valid Scenarios:**
   - The code attempts to count the number of valid starting and ending positions for Alice's token based on the positions of Bob's questions. However, it does not correctly handle the movement of the token between questions and the condition that Alice can move the token to an adjacent cell before or after answering a question.
   - The main issue lies in how the `counter` list is used to determine the validity of scenarios. The logic for checking whether an integer appears consecutively or not is flawed and does not account for the possibility of Alice moving the token to an adjacent cell.

2. **Example where the Code Fails:**
   - Consider the input `n = 5`, `k = 3`, and `x = [5, 1, 4]`.
   - According to the problem description, valid scenarios include (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), and (4, 5).
   - However, the code incorrectly counts these scenarios because it does not properly account for the possibility of Alice moving the token to an adjacent cell. For example, the scenario (4, 5) is only valid if Alice moves her token from cell 4 to cell 5 after answering the last question. The current implementation does not consider this possibility.

3. **Expected Behavior vs. Actual Behavior:**
   - The code should consider all possible ways Alice can move her token to an adjacent cell before or after answering a question to ensure she can answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions.
   - The code should correctly handle the logic for counting valid starting and ending positions for Alice's token, taking into account the possibility of movement between questions.

Given these issues, the code fails to correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **False**.
