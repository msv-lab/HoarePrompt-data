You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alice and Bob are playing a game on a line with n cells. There are n cells labeled from 1 through n. For each i from 1 to n-1, cells i and i+1 are adjacent.

Alice initially has a token on some cell on the line, and Bob tries to guess where it is. 

Bob guesses a sequence of line cell numbers x_1, x_2, …, x_k in order. In the i-th question, Bob asks Alice if her token is currently on cell x_i. That is, Alice can answer either "YES" or "NO" to each Bob's question.

At most one time in this process, before or after answering a question, Alice is allowed to move her token from her current cell to some adjacent cell. Alice acted in such a way that she was able to answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions.

Note that Alice can even move her token before answering the first question or after answering the last question. Alice can also choose to not move at all.

You are given n and Bob's questions x_1, …, x_k. You would like to count the number of scenarios that let Alice answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions. 

Let (a,b) denote a scenario where Alice starts at cell a and ends at cell b. Two scenarios (a_i, b_i) and (a_j, b_j) are different if a_i ≠ a_j or b_i ≠ b_j.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n,k ≤ 10^5) — the number of cells and the number of questions Bob asked.

The second line contains k integers x_1, x_2, …, x_k (1 ≤ x_i ≤ n) — Bob's questions.

Output

Print a single integer, the number of scenarios that let Alice answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions.

Examples

Input


5 3
5 1 4

9


Input


4 8
1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1


Output


0


Input


100000 1
42


Output


299997

Note

The notation (i,j) denotes a scenario where Alice starts at cell i and ends at cell j.

In the first example, the valid scenarios are (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5). For example, (3,4) is valid since Alice can start at cell 3, stay there for the first three questions, then move to cell 4 after the last question. 

(4,5) is valid since Alice can start at cell 4, stay there for the first question, the move to cell 5 for the next two questions. Note that (4,5) is only counted once, even though there are different questions that Alice can choose to do the move, but remember, we only count each pair of starting and ending positions once.

In the second example, Alice has no valid scenarios.

In the last example, all (i,j) where |i-j| ≤ 1 except for (42, 42) are valid scenarios.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic for counting valid scenarios where Alice can answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions is flawed.

Here’s why the code is incorrect:

1. **Initialization and Handling of `counter` Array**: The `counter` array is used to keep track of the earliest and latest occurrence of each cell number in the sequence of Bob's questions. However, the logic to update and handle the `counter` array is not correctly implemented.

2. **Validation Logic**: The validation logic for checking whether Alice can avoid answering "YES" to any of Bob's questions is incomplete. The conditions to check if Alice can move between cells to avoid a "YES" response are not fully covered.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
5 3
5 1 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
9
```

However, the provided code will not produce the correct output for this case. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of why:

1. **Initialization of `counter`**: The `counter` array is initialized to store tuples `(earliest_occurrence, latest_occurrence)` for each cell.

2. **Updating `counter`**: As we iterate through the list of Bob's questions, we update the `counter` array. However, the logic for updating the `counter` array is not complete and may lead to incorrect results.

3. **Counting Valid Scenarios**: The logic to count valid scenarios where Alice can answer "NO" to all questions is incomplete. It fails to correctly handle the movement of Alice's token and the conditions under which she can avoid answering "YES".

To fix the code, you would need to correctly implement the logic for updating the `counter` array and validate the scenarios more comprehensively. The current implementation does not fully capture all valid scenarios where Alice can answer "NO" to all questions, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

    #
    #### Loop Code Analysis:
    #```python
    #for i in range(1, n + 1):
    #    if counter[i][0] == -1:
    #        res += 1
    #```
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
    #- `counter` is a list of tuples.
    #- `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
    #- `res` is 0.
    #
    #### Understanding the Loop:
    #- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` inclusive.
    #- For each iteration `i`, it checks if the first element of the `i-th` tuple in `counter` is `-1`.
    #- If `counter[i][0] == -1`, then `res` is incremented by 1.
    #
    #### Output State After Some Iterations:
    #- **After 1 iteration:**
    #  - `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
    #  - `counter` is a list of tuples.
    #  - `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
    #  - `res` is incremented by 1 if `counter[1][0]` equals `-1`.
    #
    #- **After 2 iterations:**
    #  - `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
    #  - `counter` is a list of tuples.
    #  - `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
    #  - `i` is 2.
    #  - `res` is incremented by 1 if `counter[2][0]` equals `-1`.
    #
    #- **After 3 iterations:**
    #  - `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
    #  - `counter` is a list of tuples.
    #  - `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
    #  - `i` is 3.
    #  - `res` is incremented by 1 if `counter[3][0]` equals `-1`.
    #
    #### Final State After All Iterations:
    #- Since the loop runs `n` times, the value of `i` after the loop completes will be `n`.
    #- `res` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration where `counter[i][0] == -1`.
    #- Therefore, `res` will be the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1`.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #- `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
    #- `counter` is a list of tuples.
    #- `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
    #- `res` is the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1`.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #**Output State:**
    #- `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
    #- `counter` is a list of tuples.
    #- `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
    #- `res` is the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1`.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code step by step and consider the conditions under which the loop executes and updates the `res` variable.
    #
    #### Loop Code Analysis
    #The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`. For each iteration, it checks the following conditions based on the value of `counter[i]` and `counter[i + 1]`:
    #
    #1. If `counter[i + 1][0]` is not `-1`:
    #   - If `counter[i + 1][1]` is not `-1`:
    #     - If `counter[i][0]` is `-1` or `counter[i][0] > counter[i + 1][1]`, increment `res`.
    #   - Otherwise (if `counter[i + 1][1]` is `-1`):
    #     - If `counter[i][0]` is `-1` or `counter[i][0] > counter[i + 1][0]`, increment `res`.
    #
    #2. If `counter[i + 1][0]` is `-1`:
    #   - Increment `res`.
    #
    #### Key Observations
    #- The loop increments `res` every time it encounters a condition that meets any of the specified criteria.
    #- The loop runs for `n-1` iterations because `i` ranges from `1` to `n-1`.
    #
    #### Final Values
    #- **`x`:** The list `x` remains unchanged since the loop does not modify it.
    #- **`counter`:** The list `counter` remains unchanged since the loop does not modify it.
    #- **`k`:** The value of `k` remains unchanged since the loop does not use it directly.
    #- **`res`:** `res` is incremented based on the conditions specified in the loop. The final value of `res` is the number of times these conditions were met during the loop execution.
    #- **`i`:** After the loop completes, `i` is set to `n`.
    #
    #### Conditions for the Loop to Execute
    #- The loop will execute `n-1` times if `n > 0` and `x` has at least `n` elements.
    #
    #### Output State After All Iterations
    #Since the loop increments `res` based on the conditions in the loop, the final value of `res` will be the count of all instances where the specified conditions were met. This count can vary depending on the contents of `counter`.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #**Output State: **`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is a value read from `readlist()`, `res` is the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1` or where the conditions in the loop are met, `i` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0.
    func_2(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `x`. It reads `n` and `k` from a list (using `readlist()`), initializes a counter list to store the first occurrence index of each integer in `x`, and then counts the number of integers in `x` that do not appear consecutively. Specifically, it increments a counter `res` for each integer that either does not appear in `x` at all or does not appear consecutively with another integer in `x`.

The function first populates the `counter` list, where each entry is a tuple containing the first occurrence index of the integer and -1 (indicating no second occurrence). Then, it iterates through the range from 1 to `n` to count how many integers in `x` do not appear consecutively or do not appear at all.

Additionally, the function includes two nested loops that further check for consecutive appearances of integers in `x` and update the `res` counter based on specific conditions. These conditions ensure that if an integer does not appear consecutively with another integer, `res` is incremented.

After executing these operations, the function calls `func_2(res)` with the final value of `res` as its argument. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` remains unchanged, `counter` is populated with the first and last occurrence indices of each integer in `x`, `k` remains unchanged, `res` contains the count of integers that do not appear consecutively or do not appear at all, and `i` is `n`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `n` or `k` are outside their respective bounds (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5).
- If `x` does not contain at least `n` elements.
- If the integers in `x` do not satisfy 1 ≤ xi ≤ n.

The function does not handle these edge cases explicitly within its current structure, leaving it to the caller to ensure valid inputs.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` does not actually use the parameters `n`, `k`, and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_k` as described in the annotations. Instead, it takes positional arguments `args` and keyword arguments `kwargs`. It concatenates the string representations of the elements in `args`, separating them with `sep`, and writes the result to `file`. After writing, it appends `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')` to the output and flushes the stream if `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`. There are no actions performed on the parameters `n`, `k`, and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_k`, and the function does not return anything. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `file` contains the concatenated string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, followed by `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, `file.flush()` has been called.
