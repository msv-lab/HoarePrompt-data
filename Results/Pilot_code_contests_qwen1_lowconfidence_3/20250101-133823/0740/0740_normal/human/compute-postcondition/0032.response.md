Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements. `counter` is a list of tuples. `k` is a value read from `readlist()`. `res` is the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1`. `i` is `n` after the loop completes. The first element of `counter[i]` is not `-1`. The current value of `counter[i][1]` is not `-1`***
