`res` is incremented by 1. The value of `res` was initially 2, so now it is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is a value read from `readlist()`, `res` is 3, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 0**
