The given code snippet does not contain any executable statements; it only contains a docstring that describes the behavior of printing to a stream or to `sys.stdout` by default. Therefore, no variables are modified, and the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cells on the line, `k` is an integer representing the number of Bob's questions, and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_k` is a list of integers representing Bob's questions where each `x_i` is between 1 and n inclusive.**
