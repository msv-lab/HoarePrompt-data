Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is a value read from `readlist()`, `res` is the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1`. `i` is `n` after the loop completes. If `counter[i][0]` is not `-1`, then:
- If `counter[i][1]` is not `-1`, and `counter[i + 1][0]` is either `-1` or greater than `counter[i][1]`, `res` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.
- If `counter[i][1]` is `-1`, and `counter[i + 1][0]` is either `-1` or greater than `counter[i][0]`, `res` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.
If `counter[i][0]` is `-1`, then `res` is incremented by 1.***
