`res` is incremented by 1. The value of `res` was previously the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1`. Since no specific value for `res` was given initially, it is understood to be initialized to the count of such tuples. After incrementing `res`, its new value is the previous count plus one. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is the value read from `readlist()`, `res` is the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1` plus 1, `i` is 1**
