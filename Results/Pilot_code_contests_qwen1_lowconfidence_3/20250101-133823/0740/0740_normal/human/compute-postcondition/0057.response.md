Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is the value read from `readlist()`. If `counter[3][0] == -1` or `counter[3][0] > counter[2][1]`, then `res` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. In the else case, `res` is incremented by 1 regardless of the condition on `counter[3][0]` and `counter[2][1]`, where `i` is 2.***
