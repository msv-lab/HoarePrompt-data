Postcondition: **`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is the value read from `readlist()`, `res` is updated based on the condition for `i = 2`. If `counter[i + 1][0] == -1` or `counter[i + 1][0] > counter[i][1]`, then `res` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged, where `i` is 2.**
