`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. However, the provided initial state does not specify the value of `x`. Since the initial state does not give a specific value for `x`, the only thing we know for sure is that the file now contains the string representation of `x`. The other variables (`args` and `at_start`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one element; if `at_start` is `False`, then the function continues executing with `at_start` as `False`; file now contains the string representation of `x`.**
