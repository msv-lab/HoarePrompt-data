The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Since `res` was initially the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1`, this operation simply increases its value by 1 without affecting the other variables.

Output State: **`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is the value read from `readlist()`, `res` is the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1` plus 1, `i` is 1**
