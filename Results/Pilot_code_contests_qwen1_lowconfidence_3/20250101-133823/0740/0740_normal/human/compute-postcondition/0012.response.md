The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. This operation does not affect the value of `sep` or any other variables except for potentially modifying the content of the file. Since no changes are made to `sep`, it remains unchanged.

Output State: **`sep` is its original value, file contains the string representation of `x` written to it**
