The code `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', b' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` does the following:

- It pops the value associated with the key 'sep' from the `kwargs` dictionary. If the key 'sep' is not present, it uses the default value `b' '`.
- It pops the value associated with the key 'file' from the `kwargs` dictionary. If the key 'file' is not present, it uses the default value `sys.stdout`.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of cells on the line.
- `k` is an integer representing the number of Bob's questions.
- `x_1, x_2, ..., x_k` is a list of integers representing Bob's questions where each `x_i` is between 1 and n inclusive.

After executing the code, the variables `sep` and `file` are updated. The values of `n`, `k`, and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cells on the line; `k` is an integer representing the number of Bob's questions; `x_1, x_2, ..., x_k` is a list of integers representing Bob's questions where each `x_i` is between 1 and n inclusive; `sep` is the value popped from `kwargs` with default `b' '`; `file` is the value popped from `kwargs` with default `sys.stdout`.**
