Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is the value read from `readlist()`, `res` is incremented by 1, and `i` is 2. If `counter[3][0] != -1` and `counter[3][0] <= counter[2][1]`, `res` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `res` is incremented by 1. In the else case, `res` is incremented by 1 regardless of the condition on `counter[3][0]` and `counter[2][1]`.*
