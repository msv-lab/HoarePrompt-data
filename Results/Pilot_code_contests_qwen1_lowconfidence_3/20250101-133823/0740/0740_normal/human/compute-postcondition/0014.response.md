Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `sep` is its original value
   - `at_start` is `False`
   - `file` contains the string representation of `x` written to it

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `args`.
   - For each iteration, it writes the string representation of `x` to the `file`.

3. **Current State Analysis:**
   - Since `at_start` is `False`, it means we are not at the start of writing to the file in this iteration.
   - `sep` remains unchanged as it is mentioned to be its original value.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - In the next iteration, `at_start` will be set to `False` again because we are not starting a new write operation.
   - We will write the string representation of the next `x` in `args` to the `file`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `sep` remains the same as its original value.
   - `at_start` remains `False`.
   - `file` will now contain the concatenated string representation of the current `x` and the previously written content.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`sep` is its original value, `at_start` is False, `file` contains the concatenated string representation of all written `x` values**
