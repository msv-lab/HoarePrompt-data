Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is a value read from `readlist()`, `res` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0. Regardless of whether the condition `counter[i + 1][1] != -1` is true or false, `res` is set to 2. If `counter[i][0] == -1` or `counter[i][0] > counter[i + 1][1]`, `res` is explicitly set to 2. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
