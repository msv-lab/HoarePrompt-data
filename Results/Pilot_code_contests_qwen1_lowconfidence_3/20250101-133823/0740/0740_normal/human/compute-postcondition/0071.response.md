Postcondition: **`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is a value read from `readlist()`, `res` is 1 (incremented by 1 in both cases), `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0. If `counter[i + 1][1]` is not -1, then `counter[i][0]` is either -1 or greater than `counter[i + 1][1]`. If `counter[i + 1][1]` is -1, then `counter[i][0]` is -1.**
