Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is a value read from `readlist()`, `res` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0. If `counter[i][0] == -1` or `counter[i][0] > counter[i + 1][1]`, then `res` is set to 2. Otherwise, the conditions remain as in the precondition.***
