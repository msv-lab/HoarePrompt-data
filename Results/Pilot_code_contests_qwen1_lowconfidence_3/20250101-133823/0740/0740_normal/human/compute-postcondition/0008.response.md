The line `at_start = False` assigns the value `False` to the variable `at_start`. The value of `args` and the content of the file are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `args` must contain at least one element; if `at_start` is `False`, then the function continues executing with `at_start` being `False`; file now contains the string representation of `x`; `at_start` is `False`.
