`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file `file`. Since `sep` is written to the file, the content of `file` changes. The previous content of `file` was the concatenated string representation of all written `x` values, and now `sep` is appended to this content. The value of `at_start` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.

Output State: **`sep` is its original value, `at_start` is False, `file` contains the concatenated string representation of all written `x` values plus the value of `sep`.**
