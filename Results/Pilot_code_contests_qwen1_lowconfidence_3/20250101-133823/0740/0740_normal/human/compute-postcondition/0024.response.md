The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_k`. Here, `n` is an integer representing the number of cells on the line, `k` is an integer representing the number of Bob's questions, and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_k` is a list of integers representing Bob's questions where each `x_i` is between 1 and `n` inclusive. The function does not specify a particular return value in the given output cases, which suggests it might return a specific output based on the input parameters, but the exact nature of the return value is not detailed here.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept parameters `n`, `k`, and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_k`, where `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_k` is a list of integers. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific nature of the return value is not detailed in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_k`, where `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_k` is a list of integers.**
