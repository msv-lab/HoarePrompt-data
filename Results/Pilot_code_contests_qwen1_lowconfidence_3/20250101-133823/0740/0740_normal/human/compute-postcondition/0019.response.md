Output State: **`args` is a list of integers, `at_start` is False, `sep` remains its original value, `file` contains the concatenated string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`.**

### Explanation:
- **`args`:** The variable `args` is a list of integers. The loop processes each element in this list.
- **`at_start`:** The variable `at_start` starts as `True` and is set to `False` after the first iteration. It remains `False` for subsequent iterations since the loop does not change its value within the loop body.
- **`sep`:** The variable `sep` retains its original value throughout the loop. The loop does not modify `sep`.
- **`file`:** The variable `file` is initially set to `sys.stdout` (or another file object specified in `kwargs`). During each iteration of the loop, the string representation of the current element in `args` is appended to `file`, followed by the value of `sep` (except for the last element).

Since the loop processes all elements in `args`, `at_start` remains `False` after all iterations. The `file` variable contains the concatenated string representation of all elements in `args`, with `sep` used as the separator between consecutive elements. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `args` is empty), `at_start` will still be `True` (or remain unchanged from its initial state), `sep` will retain its original value, and `file` will be `sys.stdout` (or the original value specified).
