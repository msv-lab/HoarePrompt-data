The variable `at_start` is set to `False`. This does not affect the value of `sep` or the content of `file`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`sep` remains its original value, `at_start` is False, and `file` contains the concatenated string representation of all written `x` values plus the value of `sep`.**
