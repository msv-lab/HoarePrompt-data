Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is a value read from `readlist()`, `res` is 3, `i` is 4, and `n` is greater than 0. The state remains unchanged regardless of whether `counter[i + 1][0]` is not equal to `-1`. If `counter[i + 1][0]` is `-1` or greater than `counter[i + 1][1]`, then `res` is updated to 3. Otherwise, `res` remains 3.***
