Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `x`. It reads `n` and `k` from a list (using `readlist()`), initializes a counter list to store the first occurrence index of each integer in `x`, and then counts the number of integers in `x` that do not appear consecutively. Specifically, it increments a counter `res` for each integer that either does not appear in `x` at all or does not appear consecutively with another integer in `x`.

The function first populates the `counter` list, where each entry is a tuple containing the first occurrence index of the integer and -1 (indicating no second occurrence). Then, it iterates through the range from 1 to `n` to count how many integers in `x` do not appear consecutively or do not appear at all.

Additionally, the function includes two nested loops that further check for consecutive appearances of integers in `x` and update the `res` counter based on specific conditions. These conditions ensure that if an integer does not appear consecutively with another integer, `res` is incremented.

After executing these operations, the function calls `func_2(res)` with the final value of `res` as its argument. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` remains unchanged, `counter` is populated with the first and last occurrence indices of each integer in `x`, `k` remains unchanged, `res` contains the count of integers that do not appear consecutively or do not appear at all, and `i` is `n`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `n` or `k` are outside their respective bounds (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5).
- If `x` does not contain at least `n` elements.
- If the integers in `x` do not satisfy 1 ≤ xi ≤ n.

The function does not handle these edge cases explicitly within its current structure, leaving it to the caller to ensure valid inputs.**

Note: The annotations provide additional detail and clarity but the actual code defines the true functionality.
