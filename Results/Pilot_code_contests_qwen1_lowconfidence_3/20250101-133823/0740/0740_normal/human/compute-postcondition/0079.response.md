Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is a value read from `readlist()`, `res` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0. If `counter[i][0]` equals -1 or if `counter[i][0]` is greater than `counter[i + 1][0]`, then `res` is set to 2. Otherwise, the value of `res` remains unchanged.***
