Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is a value read from `readlist()`, `res` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0. After executing the if-else block, `counter[i][0]` is either -1 or greater than `counter[i + 1][1]` if `counter[i + 1][0]` is not -1; otherwise, `counter[i][0]` is -1.***
