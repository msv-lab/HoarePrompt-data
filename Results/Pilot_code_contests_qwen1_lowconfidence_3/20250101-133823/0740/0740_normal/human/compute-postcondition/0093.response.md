The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters. The parameter constraints are defined within the problem statement but not as part of the function definition. The function should process the parameters `n`, `k`, and `x` as described, where `n` and `k` are integers with specific ranges, and `x` is a list of `k` integers each ranging from 1 to `n`.

Given the output cases are not explicitly stated in the function definition but in the problem description, the function's behavior is inferred from these constraints.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `k`, and `x` as described, and based on these parameters, perform some unspecified operation and return a result accordingly.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `x` where `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, and `x` is a list of `k` integers each satisfying 1 ≤ xi ≤ n.**
