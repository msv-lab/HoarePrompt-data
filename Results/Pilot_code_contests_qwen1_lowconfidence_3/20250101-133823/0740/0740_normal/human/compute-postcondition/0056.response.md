Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is the value read from `readlist()`, `res` is `res + 1`, and `i` is 2. If `counter[i + 1][0]` is either `-1` or greater than `counter[i][0]`, then the condition is met, and `res` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `res` remains unchanged.***
