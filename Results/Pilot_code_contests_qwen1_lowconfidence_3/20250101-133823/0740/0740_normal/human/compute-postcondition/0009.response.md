Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `args` must contain at least one element.
   - If `at_start` is `False`, then the function continues executing with `at_start` being `False`.
   - The `file` now contains the string representation of `x`.
   - `at_start` is `False`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for x in args:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `args`.
   - Since `at_start` is already `False` and remains `False`, the loop condition does not depend on `at_start`.
   - The loop condition depends on the elements of `args`. For the loop to continue, `args` must still contain at least one element.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - After processing an element from `args`, `args` will have one less element.
   - Therefore, `args` must still contain at least one element for the loop to execute again.

5. **New State:**
   - `args` must contain at least one element (one less than before).
   - The `file` now contains the string representation of the current `x` (the next element to be processed).
   - `at_start` remains `False`.

**Final State:**
State: **`args` must contain at least one element, `file` now contains the string representation of the current `x`, `at_start` is `False`**
