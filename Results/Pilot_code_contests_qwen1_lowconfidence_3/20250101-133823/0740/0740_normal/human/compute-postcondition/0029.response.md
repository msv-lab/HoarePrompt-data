Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Loop Code Analysis:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if counter[i][0] == -1:
        res += 1
```

### Initial State:
- `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
- `counter` is a list of tuples.
- `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
- `res` is 0.

### Understanding the Loop:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- For each iteration `i`, it checks if the first element of the `i-th` tuple in `counter` is `-1`.
- If `counter[i][0] == -1`, then `res` is incremented by 1.

### Output State After Some Iterations:
- **After 1 iteration:**
  - `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
  - `counter` is a list of tuples.
  - `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
  - `res` is incremented by 1 if `counter[1][0]` equals `-1`.

- **After 2 iterations:**
  - `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
  - `counter` is a list of tuples.
  - `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
  - `i` is 2.
  - `res` is incremented by 1 if `counter[2][0]` equals `-1`.

- **After 3 iterations:**
  - `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
  - `counter` is a list of tuples.
  - `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
  - `i` is 3.
  - `res` is incremented by 1 if `counter[3][0]` equals `-1`.

### Final State After All Iterations:
- Since the loop runs `n` times, the value of `i` after the loop completes will be `n`.
- `res` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration where `counter[i][0] == -1`.
- Therefore, `res` will be the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1`.

### Final Output State:
- `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
- `counter` is a list of tuples.
- `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
- `res` is the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1`.

### Conclusion:
**Output State:**
- `x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements.
- `counter` is a list of tuples.
- `k` is a value read from `readlist()`.
- `res` is the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1`.
