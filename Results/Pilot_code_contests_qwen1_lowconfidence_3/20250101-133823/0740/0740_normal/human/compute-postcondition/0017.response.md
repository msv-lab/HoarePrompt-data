`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. This operation does not affect the values of `sep` or `at_start`. However, it does modify the content of `file` by appending the string representation of `x` to it. Since `at_start` is initially `False`, the condition `not at_start` evaluates to `True`, and thus, `file` will include the value of `sep` after writing `str(x)`.

Output State: **`sep` remains its original value, `at_start` is False, and `file` contains the concatenated string representation of all written `x` values plus the value of `sep`.**
