Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is a value read from `readlist()`, `res` is 1 (since it was incremented by 1), `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, the current value of `counter[i + 1][0]` is -1, and the condition `counter[i][0] == -1 or counter[i][0] > counter[i + 1][0]` is true.***
