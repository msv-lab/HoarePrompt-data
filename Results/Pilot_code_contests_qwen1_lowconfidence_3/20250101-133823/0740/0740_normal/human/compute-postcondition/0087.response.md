Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is a value read from `readlist()`, `res` is 3, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 0. If `counter[i][0]` is either `-1` or greater than `counter[i + 1][0]`, then `res` is set to 3. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
