`res` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is a value read from `readlist()`, `res` is the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1` plus 1, `i` is `n` after the loop completes, the first element of `counter[i]` is not `-1`, and `counter[i][1]` is `-1`. The current value of `counter[i + 1][0]` is either `-1` or greater than the current value of `counter[i][0]`.**
