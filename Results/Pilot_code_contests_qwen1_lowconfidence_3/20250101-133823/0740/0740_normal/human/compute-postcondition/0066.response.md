Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is a value read from `readlist()`, `res` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, the current value of `counter[i + 1][0]` is not -1, and the current value of `counter[i + 1][1]` is not -1. Additionally, either `counter[i][0]` is -1 or `counter[i][0]` is greater than `counter[i + 1][1]`.***
