Postcondition: ***`args` is a list of integers, `at_start` is False, `sep` remains its original value, `file` contains the concatenated string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, followed by `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, `file.flush()` has been called.***
