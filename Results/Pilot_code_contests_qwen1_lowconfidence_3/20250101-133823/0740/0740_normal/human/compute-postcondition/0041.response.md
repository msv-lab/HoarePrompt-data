Postcondition: **`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is a value read from `readlist()`, `res` is the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1`, `i` is `n` after the loop completes, and the first element of `counter[i]` is `-1`**
