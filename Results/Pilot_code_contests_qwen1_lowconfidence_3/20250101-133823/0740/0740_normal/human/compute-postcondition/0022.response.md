The code `file.flush()` calls the `flush` method on the `file` object. This does not change the content of `file`, but it ensures that any buffered data is written to the file immediately. The other variables (`args`, `at_start`, `sep`, and `kwargs`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`args` is a list of integers, `at_start` is False, `sep` remains its original value, `file` contains the concatenated string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, followed by `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')`, and `file.flush()` has been called.**
