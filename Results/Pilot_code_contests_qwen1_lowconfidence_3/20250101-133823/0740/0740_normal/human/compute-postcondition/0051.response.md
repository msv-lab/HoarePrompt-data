Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is the value read from `readlist()`. If `counter[i+1][0]` is either `-1` or greater than `counter[i][1]`, or if `counter[i+1][0]` is `-1` or greater than `counter[i][0]`, then `res` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `res` is one more than the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1`. `i` is 1.***
