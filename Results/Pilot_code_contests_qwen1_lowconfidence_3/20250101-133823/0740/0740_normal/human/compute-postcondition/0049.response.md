Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `counter` is a list of tuples, `k` is the value read from `readlist()`, `res` is the count of tuples in `counter` where the first element is `-1`, and `i` is 1. If `counter[i + 1][0]` is either `-1` or greater than `counter[i][1]`, then `res` is incremented by 1. Similarly, if `counter[i + 1][0] == -1` or `counter[i + 1][0] > counter[i][0]`, then `res` is incremented by 1.***
