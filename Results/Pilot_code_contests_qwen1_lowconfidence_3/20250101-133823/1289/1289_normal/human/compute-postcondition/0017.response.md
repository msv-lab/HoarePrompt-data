The code snippet reads two integers `a` and `b` from user input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This impacts the values of `a` and `b`, while other variables remain unchanged.

- Initially, `n` is the number of mines (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000 and n > 0).
- `t` is equal to `n`.
- `maxx` is the maximum of `-10` and `a`.
- `miny` is the minimum of `10` and `b`.
- `a` is an integer from user input.
- `b` is an integer from user input.
- `z` is `k + 2` where `k < n`.
- `maxx` is the maximum of `-10` and `a`.
- `minx` is the minimum of `10` and `a` after being updated to be the minimum of its original value and `a`.
- `maxy` is the maximum of its initial value and `b`.

After the code runs, the new values are:
- `a` and `b` are updated to the values of the integers entered by the user.
- `maxx` remains the maximum of `-10` and the new value of `a`.
- `miny` remains the minimum of `10` and the new value of `b`.
- `z` remains `k + 2` where `k < n`.
- `minx` remains the minimum of `10` and the new value of `a`.
- `maxy` remains the maximum of its initial value and the new value of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is the number of mines (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000 and n > 0), `t` is equal to `n`, `maxx` is the maximum of `-10` and the new value of `a`, `miny` is the minimum of `10` and the new value of `b`, `a` is the new integer value from user input, `b` is the new integer value from user input, `z` is `k + 2` where `k < n`, `minx` is the minimum of `10` and the new value of `a`, `maxy` is the maximum of its initial value and the new value of `b`**.
