`t` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, which reads an integer input from the user. This input represents the number of mines `n`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: The input consists of the number of mines `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) followed by `n` lines, each containing a pair of integers `xi` and `yi` representing the coordinates of a mine (-10^9 ≤ `xi`, `yi` ≤ 10^9), and `t` is equal to `n`.
