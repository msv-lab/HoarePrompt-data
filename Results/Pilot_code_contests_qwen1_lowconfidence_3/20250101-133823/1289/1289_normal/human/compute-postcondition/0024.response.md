The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it expects input in a specific format where the first line contains an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the number of mines, followed by `n` lines, each containing a pair of integers `xi` and `yi` representing the coordinates of a mine (-10^9 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 10^9). All coordinates are distinct.

Based on the input provided, the function processes the data but does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the problem statement. Since no return value is specified, we can infer that the function might be processing or analyzing the data without returning anything.
