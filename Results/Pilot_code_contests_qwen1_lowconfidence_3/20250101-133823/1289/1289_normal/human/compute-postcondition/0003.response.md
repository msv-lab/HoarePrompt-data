The line `miny = 10 ** 18` assigns the value `10 ** 18` to the variable `miny`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, or `maxx`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is equal to the number of mines (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `t` is equal to `n`, `maxx` is `-10`, `minx` is `10`, `miny` is `10 ** 18`**
