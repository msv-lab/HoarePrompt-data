The code initializes `maxx` and `maxy` to the minimum possible values for a 64-bit signed integer (`-10 ** 18`). This does not affect the values of `n` or `t`, which remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is equal to the number of mines (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `t` is equal to `n`, `maxx` is `-10 ** 18`, `maxy` is `-10 ** 18`**
