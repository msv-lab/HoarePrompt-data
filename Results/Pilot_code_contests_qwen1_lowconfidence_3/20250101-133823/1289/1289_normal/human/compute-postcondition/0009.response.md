`miny` is updated to be the minimum of its current value (`10`) and the new value `b`. Since `b` is an integer from user input, its exact value is not specified. However, `miny` will now be the lesser of `10` and `b`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is the number of mines (2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 1000 and n > 0); `t` is equal to `n`; `maxx` is the maximum of `-10` and `a`; `minx` is the minimum of `10` and `a`; `miny` is the minimum of `10` and `b`; `a` is an integer from user input; `b` is an integer from user input**
