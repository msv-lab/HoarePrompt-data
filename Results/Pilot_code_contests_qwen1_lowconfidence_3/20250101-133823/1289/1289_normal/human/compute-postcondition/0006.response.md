`maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (`-10`) and the value of `a`. Since the exact value of `a` is not specified, we can only say that `maxx` is now the maximum of `-10` and `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is the number of mines (2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 1000 and n > 0), `t` is equal to `n`, `maxx` is the maximum of `-10` and `a`, `minx` is `10`, `miny` is `10`, `a` is an integer from user input, `b` is an integer from user input**
