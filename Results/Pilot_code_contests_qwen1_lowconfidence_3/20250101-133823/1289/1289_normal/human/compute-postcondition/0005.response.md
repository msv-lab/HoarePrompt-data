The code `a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `n`, `t`, `maxx`, and `miny` remain unchanged.

- `n` is the number of mines, with 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000 and n > 0.
- `t` is equal to `n`.
- `maxx` is `-10`.
- `minx` is `10`.
- `miny` is `10`.

After the code executes, the values of `a` and `b` are set to the integers provided by the user.

Output State: **`n` is the number of mines (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000 and n > 0), `t` is equal to `n`, `maxx` is `-10`, `minx` is `10`, `miny` is `10`, `a` is an integer from user input, `b` is an integer from user input**
