The code `a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and splits them into two variables `a` and `b`. It converts the input strings into integers.

- The initial values of `n`, `t`, `maxx`, `minx`, and `miny` remain unchanged.
- `a` and `b` are updated with the values entered by the user after conversion to integers.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is the number of mines (2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 1000 and n > 0); `t` is equal to `n`; `maxx` is the maximum of `-10` and `a`; `minx` is the minimum of `10` and `a`; `miny` is the minimum of `10` and `b`; `a` is an integer from user input; `b` is an integer from user input; `z` is `k + 1` where `k < n` and `a` and `b` are the integers entered by the user.**
