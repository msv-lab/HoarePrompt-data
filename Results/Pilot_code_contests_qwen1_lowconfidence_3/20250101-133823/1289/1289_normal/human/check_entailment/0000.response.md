Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum area of the city that can cover all the mines. The logic in the program calculates the width and height of the rectangle that can cover all the mines but does not necessarily ensure that the sides of the rectangle are aligned with the coordinate axes. This means the area calculated might not be the minimum possible area of a square that can cover all the mines.

For example, consider the following input:

Input:
```
3
0 0
1 1
2 2
```

The correct output should be 4 because the smallest square that can cover all these points has side length 2, making the area 4. However, the program will output 1 because it calculates the width and height of the bounding box, which is 2 and 2 respectively, and the maximum of these values squared is 4. But since the mines form a diagonal line, the correct answer should be the side length of the smallest square that can cover them, which is 2, resulting in an area of 4.

The program needs to find the maximum difference in x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately and then take the square of the maximum of these two differences to get the correct minimum area of the city.
