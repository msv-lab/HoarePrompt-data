Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. The function calculates the differences between the maximum and minimum \( x \)-coordinates and \( y \)-coordinates separately, and then prints the square of the larger of these differences. While this approach correctly determines the side length of the smallest possible square that can contain all the mines, the problem description specifies that the sides of the city should be parallel to the coordinate axes. The code does not ensure that the calculated side length corresponds to the actual dimensions needed to encompass all the mines within or on the border of the square.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
0 0
1 1
2 2
```

The correct output should be 4 because the smallest square that can contain all three points has a side length of 2. However, the given code will incorrectly compute the differences and output the square of the larger difference, which would be 4 (since the maximum difference in both \( x \) and \( y \) directions is 2).

Thus, the code does not handle the requirement to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
