Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum area of the city. The issue lies in how the maximum and minimum x and y values are being calculated. The program calculates the differences between the maximum and minimum x values and the maximum and minimum y values separately, but it should calculate the differences between the maximum and minimum of the combined x and y values to ensure the city is a square and covers all mines.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
0 0
2 2
2 0
```

The program would output `4` because it calculates the differences as `max(0, 2) - min(0, 2) = 2` and `max(0, 0) - min(0, 0) = 0`, and then squares the larger difference, which is `2`. However, the correct minimum area should be `8` because the smallest square that can cover all the mines has a side length of `2` in both directions.

To fix this, the program should calculate the maximum and minimum of the combined x and y values:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    points = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        points.append((x, y))
    
    minx = min(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
    maxx = max(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
    miny = min(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
    maxy = max(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
    
    side_length = max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)
    print(side_length ** 2)
```

This corrected version ensures that the city is a square and covers all the mines correctly.
