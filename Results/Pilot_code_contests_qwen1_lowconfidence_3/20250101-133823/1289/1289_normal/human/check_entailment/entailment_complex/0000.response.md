Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of mines (`n`) and the coordinates of each mine. It handles the input as expected, where `n` is between 2 and 1000, and each coordinate is an integer between \(-10^9\) and \(10^9\).

2. **Coordinate Calculation**:
   - The program initializes variables `maxx`, `maxy`, `minx`, and `miny` to extreme values to ensure that the first input coordinates will update them correctly.
   - It iterates over the `n` coordinates, updating `maxx`, `maxy`, `minx`, and `miny` with the maximum and minimum values found in the input.

3. **City Size Calculation**:
   - After determining the maximum and minimum coordinates, the program calculates the width and height of the smallest square that can enclose all the mines. This is done by taking the maximum of the differences `(maxx - minx)` and `(maxy - miny)`.
   - The area of this square is then printed as the output.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the area of the smallest square that can cover all the mines. This is exactly what the problem description asks for.

Given that the program correctly reads the input, processes it to find the necessary coordinates, and calculates the area of the smallest square enclosing all mines, it satisfies the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
