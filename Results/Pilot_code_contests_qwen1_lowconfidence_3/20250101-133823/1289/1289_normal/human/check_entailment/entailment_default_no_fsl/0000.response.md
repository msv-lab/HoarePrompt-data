Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum area of the city that can cover all the mines. The code calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum \( x \)-coordinates and \( y \)-coordinates separately and then prints the square of the larger of these two differences. This approach only works if the mines form a rectangle aligned with the coordinate axes. However, the problem requires finding the smallest square that can cover all the mines, which may not align with the coordinate axes.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
0 0
1 1
2 0
```

The code would output:
```
4
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
4
```

But if the mines were arranged in such a way that they formed a diagonal rectangle, like this:
```
3
0 0
1 1
2 2
```

The code would still output:
```
4
```

which is incorrect because the minimum area square that can cover all the mines would have an area of 8 (since the diagonal distance between (0,0) and (2,2) is \(\sqrt{8}\), and the side length of the square would be \(\sqrt{8}\), giving an area of 8).

Therefore, the code fails to handle cases where the mines do not form a rectangle aligned with the coordinate axes, and thus does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
