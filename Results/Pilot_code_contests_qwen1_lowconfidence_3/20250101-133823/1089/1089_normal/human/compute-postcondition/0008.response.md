Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `s` is -1, `f` is -1, `a` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `b` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `numbers` is a list of integers derived from the input line read from `stdin`, `cnt` is a list of `n` zeros. If `numbers[0] == numbers[s]`, then the first element of `cnt` is set to 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
