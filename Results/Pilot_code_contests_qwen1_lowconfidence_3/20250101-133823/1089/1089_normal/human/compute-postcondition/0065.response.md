To determine the output state of the given loop, let's analyze the behavior step by step based on the provided examples and the loop code.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State**:
   - `l` is -1
   - `r` is `n`

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `r > l + 1`, meaning there is more than one element between `l` and `r`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - On each iteration, `m` is calculated as the midpoint of `l` and `r`: `m = (r + l) // 2`.
   - Based on the value of `cnt[m]` compared to `cnt[f]`, either `r` or `l` is updated:
     - If `cnt[m] >= cnt[f]`, then `r` is set to `m`.
     - If `cnt[m] < cnt[f]`, then `l` is set to `m`.

4. **Behavior Over Multiple Iterations**:
   - The loop essentially narrows down the range `[l, r]` by adjusting `l` and `r` until the condition `r > l + 1` is no longer satisfied.
   - The loop continues until `l + 1 == r`, meaning the range has collapsed to a single element.

5. **Final State**:
   - Once the loop exits, `l` and `r` will both be equal to the same value, and this value will be the midpoint of the initial range `[l, r]` where the condition `cnt[m]` does not satisfy the comparison with `cnt[f]` further.
   - Since `l` starts at -1, the final value of `r` (and hence `l`) will be the smallest integer such that the condition `cnt[m]` does not hold, and `r` will be just above this value.

### Output State Calculation

After all iterations of the loop have executed, the output state is as follows:

- `l` and `r` will both be equal to the integer such that the loop's condition no longer holds.
- This integer is determined by the midpoint calculation repeatedly narrowing the range until the condition fails.

Thus, the output state is:

**Output State: `'l' and 'r' are equal, both being the largest integer \( m \) such that \( cnt[m] < cnt[f] \), and if no such \( m \) exists, 'l' and 'r' will be the smallest integer where the condition no longer holds.**
