The code assigns the value of `m` to `l`. The previous value of `m` is `(r - 1) // 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is `f - s`, `f` is unknown, `s` is unknown, `l` is now `(r - 1) // 2`, `m` is `(r - 1) // 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `r` must be greater than 1.

Output State: **`ans` is `f - s`, `f` is unknown, `s` is unknown, `l` is `(r - 1) // 2`, `m` is `(r - 1) // 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `r` must be greater than 1**
