Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is -1, `f` is -1, `a` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `b` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `numbers` is a list of integers derived from the input line read from `stdin`, and `cnt` is a list of `n` integers. If `numbers[i] == numbers[s]`, then the `i-th` element of `cnt` is `1` and all other elements are `0`. Otherwise, `cnt[i]` remains equal to `cnt[i - 1]`.***
