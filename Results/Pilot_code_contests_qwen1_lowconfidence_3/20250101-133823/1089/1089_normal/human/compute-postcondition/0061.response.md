The code updates the value of `m` to be the integer division of `(r + l)` by 2. Since the initial value of `m` was \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\), this value is no longer relevant. After executing the code, the new value of `m` is \((r + l) // 2\).

Output State: **`l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, and `m` is \((r + l) // 2\)**
