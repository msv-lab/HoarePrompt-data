The code `r = m` updates the value of `r` to be equal to the current value of `m`. Given the initial state, `m` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`. Therefore, after executing the code, `r` will be equal to `(n - 1) // 2`.

The states of the other variables (`l`, `m`, and `cnt[m]`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`l` is -1, `r` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n - 1) // 2`, and the current value of `cnt[m]` is greater than or equal to `cnt[f]`**
