Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `l` is an integer.
   - `r` is an integer.
   - `m` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\).
   - If `cnt[m]` is greater than or equal to `cnt[f]`, then `l` remains -1 and `r` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\).
   - Otherwise, `l` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\) and `r` is `n`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `r > l + 1`.

3. **Conditions Inside the Loop**:
   - We need to determine how `l` and `r` change inside the loop.
   - Based on the given conditions, we know:
     - If `cnt[m]` is greater than or equal to `cnt[f]`, then `l` remains -1 and `r` becomes \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\).
     - Otherwise, `l` becomes \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\) and `r` becomes `n`.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes Again**:
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `r > l + 1` must hold true.
   - We need to check the values of `l` and `r` after the previous iteration to determine what adjustments are necessary.

### Previous Iteration States:
- `l` is an integer.
- `r` is an integer.
- `m` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\).

### Possible Scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: `cnt[m]` is greater than or equal to `cnt[f]`
- `l` remains -1.
- `r` becomes \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\).

For the loop to continue:
- \( r = \frac{n - 1}{2} \)
- \( l = -1 \)
- Therefore, \( r > l + 1 \) is satisfied because \(\frac{n - 1}{2} > -1 + 1\) which simplifies to \(\frac{n - 1}{2} > 0\), and this is always true since \( n > 1 \).

#### Scenario 2: `cnt[m]` is less than `cnt[f]`
- `l` becomes \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\).
- `r` becomes `n`.

For the loop to continue:
- \( r = n \)
- \( l = \frac{n - 1}{2} \)
- Therefore, \( r > l + 1 \) is satisfied because \( n > \frac{n - 1}{2} + 1 \) which simplifies to \( n > \frac{n + 1}{2} \), and this is always true since \( n > 1 \).

### Conclusion:
In both scenarios, the condition \( r > l + 1 \) holds true. Thus, no additional adjustments are necessary to ensure the loop can execute one more time based on the given conditions.

### Final Answer:
State: **`l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, and `m` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\)**.
