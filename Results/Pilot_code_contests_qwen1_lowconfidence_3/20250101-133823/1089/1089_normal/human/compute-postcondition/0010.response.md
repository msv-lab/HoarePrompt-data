Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is -1, `f` is -1, `a` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `b` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `numbers` is a list of integers derived from the input line read from `stdin`, `cnt` is a list of `n` zeros. The current value of `i` satisfies the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[s]`.***
