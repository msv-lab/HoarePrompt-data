The code `f -= 1` decrements the value of `f` by 1. The initial value of `f` is an integer, and after decrementing it by 1, the new value of `f` is `f - 1`. The states of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `s` is an integer - 1, `f` is an integer - 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `b` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `numbers` is a list of integers derived from the input line read from `stdin`, `cnt` is a list of `n` zeros**
