`l` is assigned the value of `m`. From the initial state, we know that `m` is either `(n - 1) // 2` if `l = -1` or `(n - 1) // 2` if `l = (n - 1) // 2`. Since the value of `l` before the assignment does not affect the value of `m`, the value of `m` remains unchanged. Therefore, the value of `l` is either `(n - 1) // 2` if `l` was `-1` or `(n - 1) // 2` if `l` was `(n - 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`ans` is `f - s`, `f` is unknown, `s` is unknown, `l` is either `(n - 1) // 2` if `l` was `-1` or `(n - 1) // 2` if `l` was `(n - 1) // 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is either `(n - 1) // 2` if `l = -1` or `(n - 1) // 2` if `l = (n - 1) // 2`, `r` is greater than `l + 1`, `m` is either `(r - 1) // 2` if `l = -1` or `(n - 1) // 2` if `l = (n - 1) // 2`**
