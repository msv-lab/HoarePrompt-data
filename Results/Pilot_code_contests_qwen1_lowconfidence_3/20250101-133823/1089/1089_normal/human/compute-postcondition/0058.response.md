The code assigns the value of `m` to `l`. Given the initial state where `l` is -1, `r` is `n`, and `m` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\), the value of `l` will be updated to \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\). The values of `r` and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\), `r` is `n`, `m` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\)**
