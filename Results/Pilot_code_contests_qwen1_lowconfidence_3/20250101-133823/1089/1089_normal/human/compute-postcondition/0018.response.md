Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is -1, `f` is -1, `a` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `b` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `numbers` is a list of integers derived from the input line read from `stdin`, `cnt` is a list of `n` integers. For all `i` from `n-1` down to 0, `cnt[i]` is either updated to `cnt[i - 1] + 1` if `numbers[i] == numbers[s]`, or remains the same as the previous element in the list.***
