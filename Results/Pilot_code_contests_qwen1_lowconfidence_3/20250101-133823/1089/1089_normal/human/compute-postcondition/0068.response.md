Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are equal, both being the largest integer \( m \) such that \( cnt[m] < cnt[f] \), and if no such \( m \) exists, `l` and `r` will be the smallest integer where the condition no longer holds. If `r` is not equal to `n`, then `ans` is initialized to `f - r`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
