The code `cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1] + 1` updates the value of `cnt[i]` based on the previous value of `cnt[i - 1]`. Since `i` satisfies the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[s]`, and given that `cnt` is initialized as a list of `n` zeros, the value of `cnt[i]` will be `cnt[i - 1] + 1`.

Given that `cnt` starts as a list of `n` zeros, `cnt[i - 1]` will be `0`. Therefore, `cnt[i]` will become `0 + 1 = 1`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is -1, `f` is -1, `a` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `b` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `numbers` is a list of integers derived from the input line read from `stdin`, `cnt` is a list of `n` elements where the `i-th` element is `1` and all other elements are `0`. The current value of `i` satisfies the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[s]`.**
