Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine its final state.

### Initial State:
- `ans` is `f - s`
- `f` is unknown
- `s` is unknown
- `l` is `-1`
- `r` is `n`

### Loop Code:
```python
while r > l + 1:
    m = (r + l) // 2
    if cnt[m] > cnt[f]:
        r = m
    else:
        l = m
```

### Analysis of Each Iteration:
#### After 1 iteration:
- The loop starts with `l = -1` and `r = n`.
- The midpoint `m` is calculated as `m = (r + l) // 2 = (n + (-1)) // 2 = (n - 1) // 2`.
- Depending on the comparison between `cnt[m]` and `cnt[f]`, either `r` or `l` is updated:
  - If `cnt[m] > cnt[f]`, then `r` is set to `m`.
  - If `cnt[m] <= cnt[f]`, then `l` is set to `m`.

#### After 2 iterations:
- If the condition `cnt[m] > cnt[f]` was true, `r` would be updated to `m` and `l` remains `-1`.
- If the condition `cnt[m] <= cnt[f]` was true, `l` would be updated to `m` and `r` remains `n`.

#### After 3 iterations:
- If the condition `cnt[m] > cnt[f]` was true, `l` remains `-1` and `r` is updated to `m`.
- If the condition `cnt[m] <= cnt[f]` was true, `l` is updated to `m` and `r` remains `n`.

### General Pattern:
- The loop continues to narrow down the range `[l, r]` until `r` is no longer greater than `l + 1`.
- Eventually, the loop will terminate when `r == l + 1`, meaning the range has been reduced to a single element.

### Final State:
- When the loop terminates, `r` will be equal to `l + 1`.
- The final value of `m` will be the last midpoint calculated, which lies within the range `[l, r]`.
- The value of `f` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- The value of `ans` remains `f - s` as it does not change inside the loop.

### Output State:
- `ans` is `f - s`
- `f` is unknown
- `s` is unknown
- `l` is the lower bound of the last valid range
- `r` is `l + 1`

Thus, the final output state of the loop is:
**Output State: `ans` is `f - s`, `f` is unknown, `s` is unknown, `l` is the lower bound of the last valid range, `r` is `l + 1`**
