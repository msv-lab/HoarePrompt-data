To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given while loop and the conditions under which the loop continues.

Given:
- The loop is defined as `while r > l + 1:`.
- This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `r > l + 1`.

The key variables involved in this loop are `r` and `l`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `r` is greater than `l + 1`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `ans` is `f - s`.
- `f` and `s` are unknown.
- `l` is either `-1` or `(n - 1) // 2`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `m` is `(n - 1) // 2`.
- `cnt[m]` is compared against `cnt[f]` inside the loop body (though the exact comparison result is not provided here).

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `r > l + 1` must be true. Let's consider the possible values of `l`:

1. If `l` is `-1`:
   - For `r > l + 1` to be true, `r` must be greater than `0` (since `-1 + 1 = 0`).
   - We don't have any specific information about `r`, but for the loop to continue, `r` must be greater than `0`.

2. If `l` is `(n - 1) // 2`:
   - For `r > l + 1` to be true, `r` must be greater than `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`.
   - Since `n > 0`, `(n - 1) // 2` is a non-negative integer, and `r` must be greater than this value.

Thus, the only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute one more time is `r` needs to be such that `r > l + 1`.

Since no specific value for `r` is provided, we can conclude that `r` must be adjusted to be greater than `l + 1` to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`ans` is `f - s`, `f` is unknown, `s` is unknown, `l` is either `-1` or `(n - 1) // 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `r` must be greater than `l + 1`**
