The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, based on the problem description, it seems like the function might be defined within a context where `n`, `a`, and `b` are predefined or passed through some other means (not shown in the provided code snippet). The function processes a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 0 and 1, where the i-th character indicates which company owns the i-th airport.

Given the output descriptions, it appears the function does not return anything explicitly mentioned. Therefore, we need to infer the return value from the problem context. Since no specific return value is mentioned, we assume the function might return a value based on some internal processing, but since it's not specified, we focus on the input parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes predefined integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n), and a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 0 and 1.**
