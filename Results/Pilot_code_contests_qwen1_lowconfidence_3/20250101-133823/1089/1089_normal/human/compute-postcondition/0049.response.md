The code assigns the value of `(r + l) // 2` to the variable `m`. Given the initial state where `l` is -1 and `r` is `n`, we can calculate `m` as follows:

\[
m = \frac{r + l}{2} = \frac{n + (-1)}{2} = \frac{n - 1}{2}
\]

Since `n` is greater than 0, the value of `m` is the integer division of `n - 1` by 2. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is -1, `r` is `n`, `m` is `(n - 1) // 2`**
