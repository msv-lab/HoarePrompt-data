`m` is reassigned the value of `(r + l) // 2`. Given that `l` is `-1` and `r` must be greater than 1, the value of `m` will be `(r - 1) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is `f - s`, `f` is unknown, `s` is unknown, `l` is `-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is `(r - 1) // 2`, `r` must be greater than 1.

Output State: **`ans` is `f - s`, `f` is unknown, `s` is unknown, `l` is `-1`, `m` is `(r - 1) // 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `r` must be greater than 1**
