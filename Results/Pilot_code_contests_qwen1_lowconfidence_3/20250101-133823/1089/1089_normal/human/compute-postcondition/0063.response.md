The code sets `l` to the value of `m`. According to the initial state, `m` is equal to \((r + l) // 2\). Therefore, after executing `l = m`, the value of `l` becomes \((r + l) // 2\). The value of `r` and the expression for `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is \((r + l) // 2\), `r` is an integer, `m` is \((r + l) // 2\)**
