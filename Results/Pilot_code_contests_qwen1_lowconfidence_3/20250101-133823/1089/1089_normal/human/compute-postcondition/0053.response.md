`l` is assigned the value of `m`. The previous value of `m` is \((n - 1) // 2\). The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `r` is `n`, `m` is \((n - 1) // 2\), and `cnt[m] < cnt[f]`.

Output State: **`l` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `r` is `n`, `m` is \((n - 1) // 2\), and `cnt[m] < cnt[f]`**
