The code snippet assigns the minimum of `s` and `f` to `s` and the maximum of `s` and `f` to `f`. Given the initial state where `s` is -1 and `f` is -1, the minimum and maximum of these two values are both -1. Therefore, the values of `s` and `f` do not change.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `numbers`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `s` is -1, `f` is -1, `a` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `b` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `numbers` is a list of integers derived from the input line read from `stdin`, `cnt` is a list of `n` zeros**
