The code assigns the value of `(r + l) // 2` to the variable `m`. Given that `l` is -1 and `r` is `n`, the value of `m` will be calculated as follows:

\[
m = \left(\frac{r + l}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{n - 1}{2}\right)
\]

Since `n` is greater than 0, the exact value of `m` depends on the value of `n`. However, we can express `m` in terms of `n`.

Output State: **`l` is -1, `r` is `n`, `m` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\)**
