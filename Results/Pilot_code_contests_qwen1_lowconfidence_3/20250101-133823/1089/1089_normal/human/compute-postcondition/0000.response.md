The code reads three integers from the standard input using `map(int, stdin.readline().split())` and assigns them to the variables `n`, `s`, and `f`. The value of `n` is read as an integer representing the number of airports, `s` as an integer representing the starting airport index, and `f` as an integer representing the destination airport index. 

Since the initial state includes that `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq n\), and after executing the given code, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, the output state will reflect the new assignments along with the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `s` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `b` is an integer between 1 and `n`**
