Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is -1, `f` is -1, `a` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `b` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `numbers` is a list of integers derived from the input line read from `stdin`, `cnt` is a list of `n` integers. If `numbers[i] == numbers[s]`, then `cnt[n-1]` is updated to `cnt[n-2] + 1`. Otherwise, `cnt[n-1]` remains unchanged (equal to `cnt[n-2]`), and `i` is updated to `n-1`.*:*
