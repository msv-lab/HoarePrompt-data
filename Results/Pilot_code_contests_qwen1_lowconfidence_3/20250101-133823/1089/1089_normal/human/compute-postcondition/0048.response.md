According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `r` and `l`. The condition for the loop to execute is `r > l + 1`. Right before the loop, `l` is -1, and `r` is `n`.

To satisfy the condition `r > l + 1`, we need to ensure that:
- `r` is greater than `l + 1`.

Given that `l` is -1, the condition simplifies to:
- `r > -1 + 1` which is `r > 0`.

Since `r` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted because `l` is already set to -1, and we only need to ensure that `r` (which is `n`) is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`l` is -1, `r` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 0**
