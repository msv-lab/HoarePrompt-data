The value of `r` is assigned the value of `m`. From the initial state, we know `m` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\). Therefore, `r` is now \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\). The value of `l` remains unchanged as -1. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is -1, `r` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\), `m` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\)**
