The code `ans = f - s` assigns the value of `f - s` to the variable `ans`. The variables `f` and `s` are not defined in the initial state, so their values are unknown. However, the subtraction operation is performed, and the result is stored in `ans`.

Output State: **`ans` is `f - s`, `f` is unknown, `s` is unknown**
