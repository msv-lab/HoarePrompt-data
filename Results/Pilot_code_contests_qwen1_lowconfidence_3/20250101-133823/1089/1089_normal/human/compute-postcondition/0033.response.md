`l` is assigned the value of `m`. The value of `m` is `(n - 1) // 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is `f - s`, `f` is unknown, `s` is unknown, `l` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `cnt[m]` is less than or equal to `cnt[f]`**
