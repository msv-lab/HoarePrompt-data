You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vladik is a competitive programmer. This year he is going to win the International Olympiad in Informatics. But it is not as easy as it sounds: the question Vladik face now is to find the cheapest way to get to the olympiad.

Vladik knows n airports. All the airports are located on a straight line. Each airport has unique id from 1 to n, Vladik's house is situated next to the airport with id a, and the place of the olympiad is situated next to the airport with id b. It is possible that Vladik's house and the place of the olympiad are located near the same airport. 

To get to the olympiad, Vladik can fly between any pair of airports any number of times, but he has to start his route at the airport a and finish it at the airport b.

Each airport belongs to one of two companies. The cost of flight from the airport i to the airport j is zero if both airports belong to the same company, and |i - j| if they belong to different companies.

Print the minimum cost Vladik has to pay to get to the olympiad.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n) — the number of airports, the id of the airport from which Vladik starts his route and the id of the airport which he has to reach. 

The second line contains a string with length n, which consists only of characters 0 and 1. If the i-th character in this string is 0, then i-th airport belongs to first company, otherwise it belongs to the second.

Output

Print single integer — the minimum cost Vladik has to pay to get to the olympiad.

Examples

Input

4 1 4
1010


Output

1

Input

5 5 2
10110


Output

0

Note

In the first example Vladik can fly to the airport 2 at first and pay |1 - 2| = 1 (because the airports belong to different companies), and then fly from the airport 2 to the airport 4 for free (because the airports belong to the same company). So the cost of the whole flight is equal to 1. It's impossible to get to the olympiad for free, so the answer is equal to 1. 

In the second example Vladik can fly directly from the airport 5 to the airport 2, because they belong to the same company.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout

def func():
    (n, s, f) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    numbers = list(map(int, list(stdin.readline().strip())))
    cnt = [0 for i in range(n)]
    s -= 1
    f -= 1
    (s, f) = (min(s, f), max(s, f))
    if numbers[0] == numbers[s]:
        cnt[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if numbers[i] == numbers[s]:
            cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1] + 1
        else:
            cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1]
    ans = f - s
    if numbers[s] != numbers[f]:
        l = -1
        r = n
        while r > l + 1:
            m = (r + l) // 2
            if cnt[m] > cnt[f]:
                r = m
            else:
                l = m
        l = -1
        r = n
        while r > l + 1:
            m = (r + l) // 2
            if cnt[m] >= cnt[f]:
                r = m
            else:
                l = m
        if r != n:
            ans = min(ans, f - r)
    else:
        ans = 0
    stdout.write(str(ans))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the starting airport (a) and the ending airport (b) belong to the same company. In such cases, the program should output 0, as no additional cost is incurred due to flights between airports belonging to different companies. However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost even when the starting and ending airports belong to the same company.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 3 4
1010
```

- The starting airport (id 3) and the ending airport (id 4) both belong to the first company (since the third and fourth characters in the string are '1').
- According to the problem description, the cost should be 0 because both airports belong to the same company.

However, the current implementation of the program will calculate the cost based on the indices of the airports, leading to an incorrect result. Specifically, the program calculates the difference `f - s` (which is `4 - 3 = 1`) and does not check if the airports belong to the same company. This results in an incorrect output of 1 instead of 0.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

from sys import stdin, stdout

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n. The second line is a string of length n consisting only of characters 0 and 1, where the i-th character being 0 means the i-th airport belongs to the first company and 1 means it belongs to the second company.
def func():
    n, s, f = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    numbers = list(map(int, list(stdin.readline().strip())))
    cnt = [(0) for i in range(n)]
    s -= 1
    f -= 1
    s, f = min(s, f), max(s, f)
    if (numbers[0] == numbers[s]) :
        cnt[0] = 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `s` is -1, `f` is -1, `a` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `b` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `numbers` is a list of integers derived from the input line read from `stdin`, `cnt` is a list of `n` zeros. If `numbers[0] == numbers[s]`, then the first element of `cnt` is set to 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if numbers[i] == numbers[s]:
            cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1] + 1
        else:
            cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
    ans = f - s
    if (numbers[s] != numbers[f]) :
        l = -1
        r = n
        while r > l + 1:
            m = (r + l) // 2
            
            if cnt[m] > cnt[f]:
                r = m
            else:
                l = m
            
        #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine its final state.
        #
        #### Initial State:
        #- `ans` is `f - s`
        #- `f` is unknown
        #- `s` is unknown
        #- `l` is `-1`
        #- `r` is `n`
        #
        #### Loop Code:
        #```python
        #while r > l + 1:
        #    m = (r + l) // 2
        #    if cnt[m] > cnt[f]:
        #        r = m
        #    else:
        #        l = m
        #```
        #
        #### Analysis of Each Iteration:
        ##### After 1 iteration:
        #- The loop starts with `l = -1` and `r = n`.
        #- The midpoint `m` is calculated as `m = (r + l) // 2 = (n + (-1)) // 2 = (n - 1) // 2`.
        #- Depending on the comparison between `cnt[m]` and `cnt[f]`, either `r` or `l` is updated:
        #  - If `cnt[m] > cnt[f]`, then `r` is set to `m`.
        #  - If `cnt[m] <= cnt[f]`, then `l` is set to `m`.
        #
        ##### After 2 iterations:
        #- If the condition `cnt[m] > cnt[f]` was true, `r` would be updated to `m` and `l` remains `-1`.
        #- If the condition `cnt[m] <= cnt[f]` was true, `l` would be updated to `m` and `r` remains `n`.
        #
        ##### After 3 iterations:
        #- If the condition `cnt[m] > cnt[f]` was true, `l` remains `-1` and `r` is updated to `m`.
        #- If the condition `cnt[m] <= cnt[f]` was true, `l` is updated to `m` and `r` remains `n`.
        #
        #### General Pattern:
        #- The loop continues to narrow down the range `[l, r]` until `r` is no longer greater than `l + 1`.
        #- Eventually, the loop will terminate when `r == l + 1`, meaning the range has been reduced to a single element.
        #
        #### Final State:
        #- When the loop terminates, `r` will be equal to `l + 1`.
        #- The final value of `m` will be the last midpoint calculated, which lies within the range `[l, r]`.
        #- The value of `f` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
        #- The value of `ans` remains `f - s` as it does not change inside the loop.
        #
        #### Output State:
        #- `ans` is `f - s`
        #- `f` is unknown
        #- `s` is unknown
        #- `l` is the lower bound of the last valid range
        #- `r` is `l + 1`
        #
        #Thus, the final output state of the loop is:
        #**Output State: `ans` is `f - s`, `f` is unknown, `s` is unknown, `l` is the lower bound of the last valid range, `r` is `l + 1`**
        l = -1
        r = n
        while r > l + 1:
            m = (r + l) // 2
            
            if cnt[m] >= cnt[f]:
                r = m
            else:
                l = m
            
        #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To determine the output state of the given loop, let's analyze the behavior step by step based on the provided examples and the loop code.
        #
        #### Step-by-Step Analysis
        #
        #1. **Initial State**:
        #   - `l` is -1
        #   - `r` is `n`
        #
        #2. **Loop Condition**:
        #   - The loop continues as long as `r > l + 1`, meaning there is more than one element between `l` and `r`.
        #
        #3. **Loop Execution**:
        #   - On each iteration, `m` is calculated as the midpoint of `l` and `r`: `m = (r + l) // 2`.
        #   - Based on the value of `cnt[m]` compared to `cnt[f]`, either `r` or `l` is updated:
        #     - If `cnt[m] >= cnt[f]`, then `r` is set to `m`.
        #     - If `cnt[m] < cnt[f]`, then `l` is set to `m`.
        #
        #4. **Behavior Over Multiple Iterations**:
        #   - The loop essentially narrows down the range `[l, r]` by adjusting `l` and `r` until the condition `r > l + 1` is no longer satisfied.
        #   - The loop continues until `l + 1 == r`, meaning the range has collapsed to a single element.
        #
        #5. **Final State**:
        #   - Once the loop exits, `l` and `r` will both be equal to the same value, and this value will be the midpoint of the initial range `[l, r]` where the condition `cnt[m]` does not satisfy the comparison with `cnt[f]` further.
        #   - Since `l` starts at -1, the final value of `r` (and hence `l`) will be the smallest integer such that the condition `cnt[m]` does not hold, and `r` will be just above this value.
        #
        #### Output State Calculation
        #
        #After all iterations of the loop have executed, the output state is as follows:
        #
        #- `l` and `r` will both be equal to the integer such that the loop's condition no longer holds.
        #- This integer is determined by the midpoint calculation repeatedly narrowing the range until the condition fails.
        #
        #Thus, the output state is:
        #
        #**Output State: `'l' and 'r' are equal, both being the largest integer \( m \) such that \( cnt[m] < cnt[f] \), and if no such \( m \) exists, 'l' and 'r' will be the smallest integer where the condition no longer holds.**
        if (r != n) :
            ans = min(ans, f - r)
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `l` and `r` are equal, both being the largest integer \( m \) such that \( cnt[m] < cnt[f] \), and if no such \( m \) exists, `l` and `r` will be the smallest integer where the condition no longer holds. If `r` is not equal to `n`, then `ans` is initialized to `f - r`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
    else :
        ans = 0
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `ans` is `f - s`, `f` is unknown, `s` is unknown. If `numbers[s] != numbers[f]`, then `ans` remains unchanged. If `numbers[s] == numbers[f]`, then `ans` is 0.
    stdout.write(str(ans))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers derived from a binary string and calculates the minimum distance between two specified positions, `s` and `f`. Initially, `s` and `f` are adjusted to be zero-based indices. The function then counts consecutive elements in the list that match the element at position `s`. It subsequently determines the shortest distance between `s` and `f` where the values in the list differ. If the values at `s` and `f` are the same, it sets the answer to zero. If the values differ, it uses a binary search-like approach to find the position `m` where the count of matching elements is less than or equal to the count at `f`, updating the answer accordingly. Finally, the function outputs the minimum distance found.
