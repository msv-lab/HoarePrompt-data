Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the starting airport (a) and the ending airport (b) belong to the same company. In such cases, the program should output 0, as no additional cost is incurred due to flights between airports belonging to different companies. However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost even when the starting and ending airports belong to the same company.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 3 4
1010
```

- The starting airport (id 3) and the ending airport (id 4) both belong to the first company (since the third and fourth characters in the string are '1').
- According to the problem description, the cost should be 0 because both airports belong to the same company.

However, the current implementation of the program will calculate the cost based on the indices of the airports, leading to an incorrect result. Specifically, the program calculates the difference `f - s` (which is `4 - 3 = 1`) and does not check if the airports belong to the same company. This results in an incorrect output of 1 instead of 0.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
