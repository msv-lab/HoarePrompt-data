Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in calculating the minimum cost. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the starting airport `a` and the destination airport `b` belong to different companies and there is no other airport between them that belongs to the same company as `a`.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  3 1 3
  101
  ```

Expected output: `1` (Vladik can fly directly from airport 1 to airport 3, which costs 2, but since they belong to different companies, the cost is `abs(1-3) = 2`. However, if we consider the company changes, the correct minimum cost should be 1, as Vladik can fly from airport 1 to airport 2 and then from airport 2 to airport 3).

However, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum cost. Let's walk through the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of airports `n`, the starting airport `s`, and the destination airport `f`.
2. It converts the input string into a list of integers representing the company of each airport.
3. It initializes a count array `cnt` to keep track of the number of times the company changes up to each airport.
4. It calculates the cost of reaching each airport if the company changes.
5. It determines the minimum cost based on whether the starting and destination airports belong to the same or different companies.

For the given test case, the program does not correctly handle the transition between companies, leading to an incorrect result. The program needs to ensure that it considers all possible transitions between companies to find the minimum cost.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
