You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vladik is a competitive programmer. This year he is going to win the International Olympiad in Informatics. But it is not as easy as it sounds: the question Vladik face now is to find the cheapest way to get to the olympiad.

Vladik knows n airports. All the airports are located on a straight line. Each airport has unique id from 1 to n, Vladik's house is situated next to the airport with id a, and the place of the olympiad is situated next to the airport with id b. It is possible that Vladik's house and the place of the olympiad are located near the same airport. 

To get to the olympiad, Vladik can fly between any pair of airports any number of times, but he has to start his route at the airport a and finish it at the airport b.

Each airport belongs to one of two companies. The cost of flight from the airport i to the airport j is zero if both airports belong to the same company, and |i - j| if they belong to different companies.

Print the minimum cost Vladik has to pay to get to the olympiad.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n) — the number of airports, the id of the airport from which Vladik starts his route and the id of the airport which he has to reach. 

The second line contains a string with length n, which consists only of characters 0 and 1. If the i-th character in this string is 0, then i-th airport belongs to first company, otherwise it belongs to the second.

Output

Print single integer — the minimum cost Vladik has to pay to get to the olympiad.

Examples

Input

4 1 4
1010


Output

1

Input

5 5 2
10110


Output

0

Note

In the first example Vladik can fly to the airport 2 at first and pay |1 - 2| = 1 (because the airports belong to different companies), and then fly from the airport 2 to the airport 4 for free (because the airports belong to the same company). So the cost of the whole flight is equal to 1. It's impossible to get to the olympiad for free, so the answer is equal to 1. 

In the second example Vladik can fly directly from the airport 5 to the airport 2, because they belong to the same company.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout

def func():
    (n, s, f) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    numbers = list(map(int, list(stdin.readline().strip())))
    cnt = [0 for i in range(n)]
    s -= 1
    f -= 1
    (s, f) = (min(s, f), max(s, f))
    if numbers[0] == numbers[s]:
        cnt[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if numbers[i] == numbers[s]:
            cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1] + 1
        else:
            cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1]
    ans = f - s
    if numbers[s] != numbers[f]:
        l = -1
        r = n
        while r > l + 1:
            m = (r + l) // 2
            if cnt[m] > cnt[f]:
                r = m
            else:
                l = m
        l = -1
        r = n
        while r > l + 1:
            m = (r + l) // 2
            if cnt[m] >= cnt[f]:
                r = m
            else:
                l = m
        if r != n:
            ans = min(ans, f - r)
    else:
        ans = 0
    stdout.write(str(ans))

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in calculating the minimum cost. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the starting airport `a` and the destination airport `b` belong to different companies and there is no other airport between them that belongs to the same company as `a`.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  3 1 3
  101
  ```

Expected output: `1` (Vladik can fly directly from airport 1 to airport 3, which costs 2, but since they belong to different companies, the cost is `abs(1-3) = 2`. However, if we consider the company changes, the correct minimum cost should be 1, as Vladik can fly from airport 1 to airport 2 and then from airport 2 to airport 3).

However, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum cost. Let's walk through the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of airports `n`, the starting airport `s`, and the destination airport `f`.
2. It converts the input string into a list of integers representing the company of each airport.
3. It initializes a count array `cnt` to keep track of the number of times the company changes up to each airport.
4. It calculates the cost of reaching each airport if the company changes.
5. It determines the minimum cost based on whether the starting and destination airports belong to the same or different companies.

For the given test case, the program does not correctly handle the transition between companies, leading to an incorrect result. The program needs to ensure that it considers all possible transitions between companies to find the minimum cost.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes a list of integers derived from a binary string and calculates the minimum distance between two specified positions, `s` and `f`. Initially, `s` and `f` are adjusted to be zero-based indices. The function then counts consecutive elements in the list that match the element at position `s`. It subsequently determines the shortest distance between `s` and `f` where the values in the list differ. If the values at `s` and `f` are the same, it sets the answer to zero. If the values differ, it uses a binary search-like approach to find the position `m` where the count of matching elements is less than or equal to the count at `f`, updating the answer accordingly. Finally, the function outputs the minimum distance found.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
