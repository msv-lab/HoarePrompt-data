#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; n is a positive integer representing the length of the array a; a is a list of integers of length n where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each element a_i in the list a; mx is the maximum value calculated during the execution of the loop, representing the minimum number of seconds required to make the array non-decreasing.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

            if a[i] < p:
                mx = max(mx, (p - a[i]).bit_length())

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, `mx` is the maximum bit length difference between `a[0]` and any element in `a` up to index `n-1`, `p` is the last element processed in the loop and is equal to `a[n-1]`, `i` is `n`, and `func_2(mx)` has been called.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, then reads the array `a` itself. It calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the array non-decreasing by comparing each element with its predecessor. If an element is smaller than its predecessor, the difference in their values is recorded in terms of bit length, and the element is adjusted to match the predecessor. The maximum bit length difference found during this process is passed to another function `func_2`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include arrays with only one element, arrays where elements are already non-decreasing, and arrays with negative values. The function assumes that `t` is always a positive integer and `n` and the elements in `a` are within the specified bounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no direct relationship or variable from the given function `func_2` that contributes to solving the described problem. The function `func_2` prints values to a stream. The precondition should be derived from the problem description rather than the given function.
def func_2():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an iterable (possibly empty), `sep` is written to the file (if the iterable has more than one element), and the file contains a concatenated string of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`at_start` is `False`, `args` is an iterable (possibly empty), the file now contains a concatenated string of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `'\n'`, `kwargs` is `{}`, and the buffer of `file` has been flushed if the `flush` key in `kwargs` is `True`. Otherwise, the buffer remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and does not return any value. It prints a sequence of values from an iterable (`args`) to a stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), with each value separated by a specified separator (`sep`). After printing all values, it appends a newline character (`'\n'`) unless otherwise specified in the `end` keyword argument. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, the output buffer is flushed immediately. The function does not modify the input iterable (`args`) or the keyword arguments (`kwargs`). If the iterable is empty, no output is produced. Edge cases include handling an empty iterable, where no output is generated, and ensuring that the buffer is flushed if the `flush` keyword is set to `True`.
