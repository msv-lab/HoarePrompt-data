Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `mx` is the maximum of the differences between `a[0]` and each subsequent element in `a` (in terms of bit length), `p` is the last element processed in the loop, `i` is `n`, and `a` is updated such that each element from `a[1]` onwards is set to `p` (where `p` is initially `a[0]` and updated in each iteration).**

Explanation:
- Initially, `p` is set to `a[0]` and `i` starts at `n`.
- The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive).
- For each iteration, if `a[i] < p`, `mx` is updated with the maximum bit length of the difference between `p` and `a[i]`.
- Then, `a[i]` is set to `p`.
- Finally, `p` is set to `a[i]`.

After the loop completes, all elements in `a` from index `1` to `n-1` will be equal to `p` (which is initially `a[0]` and updates with each iteration), and `mx` will store the maximum bit length of the differences between `a[0]` and each of these elements.

Thus, the final state after the loop completes will be as described above.
