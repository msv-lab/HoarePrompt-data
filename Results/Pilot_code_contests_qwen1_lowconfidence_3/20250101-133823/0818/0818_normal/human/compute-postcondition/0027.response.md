`mx` is assigned the value 0. This resets `mx` to 0, which was previously the maximum bit length difference between `a[0]` and any element in `a` up to index `n-1`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input string, `mx` is 0, `p` is the last element in `a` that was updated, `i` is the new value of `n`, `func_2(mx)` has been called.**
