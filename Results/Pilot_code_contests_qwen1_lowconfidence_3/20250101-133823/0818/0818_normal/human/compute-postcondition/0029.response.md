State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input string, `mx` is 0, `p` is the first element in `a`, `i` is the new value of `n` minus 1 (since the loop starts from 1 to n-1), `func_2(mx)` has been called**

Explanation:
- The loop `for i in range(1, n):` means that `i` will take values from 1 to `n-1`.
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. Given that `t` is already stated as greater than 0, this implies `n` should also be at least 1.
- `i` is initialized as `n` in the given state but since the loop starts from 1 to `n-1`, `i` should be set to `n - 1` initially.

Therefore, the required adjustments are:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` should be set to `n - 1`.

Final state:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input string, `mx` is 0, `p` is the first element in `a`, `i` is the new value of `n - 1`, `func_2(mx)` has been called**
