`p` is assigned the value of `a[0]`. The value of `a[0]` is the first element in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input string, `mx` is 0, `p` is the first element in `a`, `i` is the new value of `n`, `func_2(mx)` has been called.
