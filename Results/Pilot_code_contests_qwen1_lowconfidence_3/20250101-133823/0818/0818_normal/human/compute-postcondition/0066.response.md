Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers where `a[4]` is updated to `a[2]`, `mx` is the maximum of the current `mx` and the bit length of `(p - a[4])`, `p` is `a[2]`, `i` is 4, and `a[3]` is now equal to `a[2]`. If `a[i] < p`, then `mx` is updated to the maximum of the current `mx` and the bit length of `(p - a[4])`. Otherwise, no change occurs in the values of `mx`, `p`, and `i`.***
