`a[i]` is assigned the value of `p`, which is `a[2]`. The value of `i` is 3, so `a[3]` is updated to `a[2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer input from the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split, `mx` is the maximum of the current `mx` and the bit length of `p - a[3]`, `p` is `a[2]`, `i` is 3, and `a[3]` is now equal to `a[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer input from the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split, `mx` is the maximum of the current `mx` and the bit length of `p - a[3]`, `p` is `a[2]`, `i` is 3, and `a[3]` is now equal to `a[2]`**.
