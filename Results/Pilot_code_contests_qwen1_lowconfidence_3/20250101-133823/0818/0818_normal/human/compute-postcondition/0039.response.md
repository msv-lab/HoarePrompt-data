The code updates the variable `p` to be equal to the value of `a[i]`. Since `a` is a list of integers and one element at index `i` is updated to `p`, `p` now holds the value of that element in the list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers where one element at index `i` is updated to `p`, `mx` is 0, `p` is equal to the value of `a[i]`**
