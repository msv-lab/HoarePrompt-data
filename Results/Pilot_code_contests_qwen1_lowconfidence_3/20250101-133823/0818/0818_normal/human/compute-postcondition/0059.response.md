The code updates the variable `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and the bit length of the difference between `p` and `a[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 3, `a[i]` is `a[3]`.

- The current value of `mx` is the maximum of the current `mx` and the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `a[1]`.
- `p` is `a[2]`.
- `i` is 3.
- `a[1]` is `a[3]`.

The bit length of a number is the number of bits required to represent it in binary form. For instance, if `p - a[i]` results in a number like 8, its bit length would be 4 because 8 in binary is `1000`.

Let's denote the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `a[1]` as `diff`. The updated value of `mx` will be the maximum of `mx` and the bit length of `p - a[3]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer input from the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split, `mx` is the maximum of the current `mx` and the bit length of `p - a[3]`, `p` is `a[2]`, `i` is 3, and `a[1]` is `a[3]`**.
