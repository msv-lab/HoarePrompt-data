`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. This operation does not affect the variables `at_start`, `args`, or the value of `x`. The value of `sep` remains unchanged because there is no condition or assignment related to `sep` in the provided code.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is written to the file, `sep` is written to the file**
