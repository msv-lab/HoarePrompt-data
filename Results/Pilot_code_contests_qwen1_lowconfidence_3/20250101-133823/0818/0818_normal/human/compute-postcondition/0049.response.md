The code `a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes an input from the user and splits it into a list of integers. This means that the value of `a` is now updated to this list of integers, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer input from the user (and must be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `mx` is the maximum bit length of `p - a[i]` for any pair where `a[i] < p`, `p` is the last updated value of `a[i]`, and `i` is equal to `n`.**
