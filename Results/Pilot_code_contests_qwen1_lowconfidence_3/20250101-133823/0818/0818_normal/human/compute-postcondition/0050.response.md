`mx` is reassigned the value 0, which overrides its previous value. The previous value of `mx` was determined by the condition `mx = 0` when `a[i] < p`, but now it is explicitly set to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer input from the user (and must be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `mx` is 0, `p` is the last updated value of `a[i]`, and `i` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer input from the user (and must be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `mx` is 0, `p` is the last updated value of `a[i]`, and `i` is equal to `n`.**
