The function `func_2(mx)` is called with `mx` as its argument. However, the function itself is not defined in the provided code snippet, so no changes are made to any variables directly within this call. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `mx`, `p`, and `i` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is either updated to `p` or remains unchanged, `mx` is the maximum bit length of `p - a[i]` for any pair where `a[i] < p`, `p` is the last updated value of `a[i]`, and `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `func_2(mx)` has been called with `mx` as an argument.**
