The function `func_2(mx)` is called, but no changes are made to the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `mx`, `p`, or `i` within this function call. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `mx` is the maximum of the differences between `a[0]` and each subsequent element in `a` (in terms of bit length), `p` is the last element processed in the loop, `i` is `n`, and `func_2(mx)` has been called.**
