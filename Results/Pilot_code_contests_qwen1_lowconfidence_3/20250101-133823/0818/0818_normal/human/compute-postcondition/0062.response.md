The code snippet `p = a[i]` assigns the value of `a[i]` (which is `a[3]` given the precondition) to the variable `p`. According to the precondition, `i` is 3, so `p` is set to `a[3]`.

Since `a[3]` is equal to `a[2]` (as stated in the precondition), `p` is assigned the value of `a[2]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `mx`, `i`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer input from the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split, `mx` is the maximum of the current `mx` and the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `a[1]`, `p` is `a[2]`, `i` is 3, and `a[3]` is now equal to `a[2]`**.
