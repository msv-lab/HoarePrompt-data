Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers where one element at index `i` is now `p`, `mx` is 0, `p` is equal to the value of `a[i]`, `i` is now `i + 1` and must be less than `n`. This is true regardless of whether `a[i]` is less than `p` or not since there is no else part that changes these conditions.***
