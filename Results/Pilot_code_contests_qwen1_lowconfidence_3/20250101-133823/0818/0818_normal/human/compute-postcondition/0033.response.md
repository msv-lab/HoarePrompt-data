Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is updated to `p`, `mx` is the bit length of `p - a[i]`, the current value of `p` is the first element in `a`, `i` is the new value of `n - 1`. If `a[i]` is less than `p`, `a[i]` is updated to `p` and `mx` is set to the bit length of `p - a[i]`. If `a[i]` is not less than `p`, no changes occur.***
