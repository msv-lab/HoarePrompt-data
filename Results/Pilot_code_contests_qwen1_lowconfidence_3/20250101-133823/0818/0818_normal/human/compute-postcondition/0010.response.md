The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. This operation does not change the values of `at_start` or `args`. The value of `x` is not directly modified by this line of code, but the task mentions that the next value of `x` is written to the file, which implies that `x` is related to the write operation.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is written to the file, and `sep` is written to the file**
