Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer input from the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split, `mx` is the maximum of the current `mx` and the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `a[1]`, `p` is `a[0]`, `i` is 2, and `a[1]` is `p`. If `a[i]` is less than `p`, `mx` is updated accordingly.***
