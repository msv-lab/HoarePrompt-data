The code `a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. This impacts the value of `a` by updating it with the new list of integers. 

The initial state is:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is the input integer
- `a` is a list of integers from the input string
- `mx` is the maximum bit length difference between `a[0]` and any element in `a` up to index `n-1`
- `p` is the last element in `a` that was updated
- `i` is the new value of `n`
- `func_2(mx)` has been called.

After executing the code, `a` is updated to a list of integers from the input string, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input string, `mx` is the maximum bit length difference between `a[0]` and any element in `a` up to index `n-1`, `p` is the last element in `a` that was updated, `i` is the new value of `n`, `func_2(mx)` has been called.**
