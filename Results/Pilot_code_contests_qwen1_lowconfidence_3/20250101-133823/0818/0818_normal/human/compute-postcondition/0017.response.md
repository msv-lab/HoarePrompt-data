The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. This changes the content of the file but does not affect the variables `at_start`, `args`, or `sep`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` is a non-empty iterable with one less element, `x` is the next element in the `args` iterable, and `sep` is written to the file.**
