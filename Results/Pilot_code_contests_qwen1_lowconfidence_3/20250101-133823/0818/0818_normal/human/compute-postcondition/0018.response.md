The line of code `at_start = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `at_start`. This does not affect any other variables, and it confirms that `at_start` is now `False`.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` is a non-empty iterable with one less element, `x` is the next element in the `args` iterable, and `sep` is written to the file.**
