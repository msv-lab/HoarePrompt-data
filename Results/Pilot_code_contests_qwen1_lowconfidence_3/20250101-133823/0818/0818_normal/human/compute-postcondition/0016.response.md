Postcondition: ***`at_start` is `False`, `args` is a non-empty iterable with one less element, `x` is the next element in the `args` iterable, and `sep` is written to the file. Since the condition `not at_start` is true, the program does not enter the if block and thus retains the initial state specified in the precondition.***
