According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is either updated to `p` or remains unchanged, `mx` is the maximum bit length of `p - a[i]` for any pair where `a[i] < p`, `p` is the last updated value of `a[i]`, and `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `func_2(mx)` has been called with `mx` as an argument.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `n`. For the loop to continue, `t` must remain greater than 0, and `i` must still be less than `t`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is either updated to `p` or remains unchanged, `mx` is the maximum bit length of `p - a[i]` for any pair where `a[i] < p`, `p` is the last updated value of `a[i]`, and `i` is equal to `n`**
