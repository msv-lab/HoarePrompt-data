The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. This does not change the values of `at_start`, `args`, or `x`. The state of `sep` being written to the file remains the same.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` is a non-empty iterable with one less element, `x` is the next element in the `args` iterable, `sep` is written to the file**
