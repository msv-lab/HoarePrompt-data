Postcondition: ***`at_start` is `False`, `args` is an iterable (possibly empty), the file now contains a concatenated string of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `'\n'`, `kwargs` is `{}`, and the buffer of `file` has been flushed if the `flush` key in `kwargs` is `True`. Otherwise, the buffer remains unchanged.***
