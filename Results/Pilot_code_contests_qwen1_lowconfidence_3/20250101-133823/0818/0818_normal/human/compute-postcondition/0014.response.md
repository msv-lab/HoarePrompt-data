According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `args` iterable. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is written to the file, and `sep` is written to the file.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. `args` must still be a non-empty iterable.
2. `x` needs to be set to the next element in the `args` iterable.
3. `sep` needs to be written to the file again (since the loop body likely writes `sep` after each element except the last one).

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `at_start` remains `False` because the condition for starting the loop again is not relevant here.
- `args` must still be a non-empty iterable, but it now contains one less element since one element has already been processed.
- `x` needs to be the next element in the `args` iterable.
- `sep` is written to the file again.

State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` is a non-empty iterable with one less element, `x` is the next element in the `args` iterable, `sep` is written to the file**
