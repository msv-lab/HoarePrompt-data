Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer input from the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split, `mx` is the maximum of the current `mx` and the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `a[1]`, `p` is `a[2]`, `i` is 3, and `a[3]` is now equal to `a[2]`. If `a[i]` (which is `a[3]`) is less than `p`, then `mx` is updated to the maximum of the current `mx` and the bit length of `p - a[3]`. Otherwise, the values remain as per the if part.***
