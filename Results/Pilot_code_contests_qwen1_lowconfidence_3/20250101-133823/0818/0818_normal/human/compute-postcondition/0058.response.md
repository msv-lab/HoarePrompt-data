According to the code, the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split.
- `mx` is the maximum of the current `mx` and the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `a[1]`.
- `p` is `a[2]`.
- `i` is 2.
- `a[1]` is `p`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` should be `3`.

At the same time, `a[1]` should be updated to the next element in the list `a`, which would be `a[3]`. Therefore, the new state should reflect these changes.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer input from the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split, `mx` is the maximum of the current `mx` and the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `a[1]`, `p` is `a[2]`, `i` is 3, and `a[1]` is `a[3]`**.
