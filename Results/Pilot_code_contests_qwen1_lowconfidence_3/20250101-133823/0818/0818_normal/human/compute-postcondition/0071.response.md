The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters. It involves internal variables and logic to process a set of inputs (t, n, a, mx) and determine a specific output based on the constraints provided.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the function processes multiple test cases, each involving an array `a` of integers and calculates `mx` which represents the minimum number of seconds required to make the array non-decreasing.

The output depends on the calculations performed within the function based on the input parameters, but since the function signature does not include any parameters, the return value must be inferred from the described behavior.

Functionality: **The function accepts internal parameters including `t` (number of test cases), `n` (length of the array `a`), `a` (list of integers), and `mx` (maximum value calculated during the loop). The function returns the minimum number of seconds required to make the array non-decreasing for each test case.**
