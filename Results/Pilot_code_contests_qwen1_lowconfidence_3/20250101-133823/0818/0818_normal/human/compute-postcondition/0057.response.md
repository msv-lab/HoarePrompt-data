The code `p = a[i]` assigns the value of `a[i]` to the variable `p`. From the initial state, we know that `i` is 2, so `p` is assigned the value of `a[2]`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer input from the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split, `mx` is the maximum of the current `mx` and the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `a[1]`, `p` is `a[2]`, `i` is 2, and `a[1]` is `p`.**
