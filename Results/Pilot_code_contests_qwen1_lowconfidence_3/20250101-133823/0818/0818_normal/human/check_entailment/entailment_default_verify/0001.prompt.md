You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have an array a of length n. For every positive integer x you are going to perform the following operation during the x-th second:

  * Select some distinct indices i_{1}, i_{2}, …, i_{k} which are between 1 and n inclusive, and add 2^{x-1} to each corresponding position of a. Formally, a_{i_{j}} := a_{i_{j}} + 2^{x-1} for j = 1, 2, …, k. Note that you are allowed to not select any indices at all.



You have to make a nondecreasing as fast as possible. Find the smallest number T such that you can make the array nondecreasing after at most T seconds.

Array a is nondecreasing if and only if a_{1} ≤ a_{2} ≤ … ≤ a_{n}.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}) — the length of array a. It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases in the input does not exceed 10^{5}.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_{1}, a_{2}, …, a_{n} (-10^{9} ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^{9}).

Output

For each test case, print the minimum number of seconds in which you can make a nondecreasing.

Example

Input


3
4
1 7 6 5
5
1 2 3 4 5
2
0 -4


Output


2
0
3

Note

In the first test case, if you select indices 3, 4 at the 1-st second and 4 at the 2-nd second, then a will become [1, 7, 7, 8]. There are some other possible ways to make a nondecreasing in 2 seconds, but you can't do it faster.

In the second test case, a is already nondecreasing, so answer is 0.

In the third test case, if you do nothing at first 2 seconds and select index 2 at the 3-rd second, a will become [0, 0].
Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
import os
import sys
from io import BytesIO, IOBase
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        mx = 0
        p = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] < p:
                mx = max(mx, (p - a[i]).bit_length())
                a[i] = p
            p = a[i]
        func_2(mx)

#Function 2:
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the smallest number of seconds \( T \) required to make the array non-decreasing according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the array needs more than one bit flip to correct the non-decreasing order.

Let's consider a test case where this issue arises:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  4
  1 7 6 5
  ```

The expected output for this test case is `2`, as explained in the problem statement. However, the provided code does not correctly compute this value. The code only considers the first difference in the array and tries to correct it with a single bit flip, which is insufficient for the given array `[1, 7, 6, 5]`.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of why the current implementation fails:
1. The first element `a[0]` is `1`.
2. The second element `a[1]` is `7`, which is greater than `1`.
3. The third element `a[2]` is `6`, which is less than `7`. This is the first difference.
4. The fourth element `a[3]` is `5`, which is less than `6`.

The current code only checks if the current element is less than the previous element and calculates the maximum bit length needed to make the array non-decreasing at that point. However, it does not account for subsequent differences that might require additional bit flips.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we account for all necessary bit flips to make the array non-decreasing. A more robust approach would involve tracking the cumulative differences and ensuring that each element is adjusted accordingly.

Here is a revised version of the function that correctly computes the smallest number of seconds \( T \):

```python
from __future__ import division, print_function
import os
import sys
from io import BytesIO, IOBase

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        required_flips = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            diff = a[i] - a[i-1]
            if diff < 0:
                required_flips = max(required_flips, diff.bit_length())
            else:
                a[i] = a[i-1]
        print(required_flips)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_1()
```

This revised function correctly computes the smallest number of seconds \( T \) by tracking the cumulative differences and ensuring that each element is adjusted accordingly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and does not return any value. It prints a sequence of values from an iterable (`args`) to a stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), with each value separated by a specified separator (`sep`). After printing all values, it appends a newline character (`'\n'`) unless otherwise specified in the `end` keyword argument. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, the output buffer is flushed immediately. The function does not modify the input iterable (`args`) or the keyword arguments (`kwargs`). If the iterable is empty, no output is produced. Edge cases include handling an empty iterable, where no output is generated, and ensuring that the buffer is flushed if the `flush` keyword is set to `True`.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
