Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the array `a` consists of only one element. According to the problem description, if the array is already non-decreasing, the minimum number of seconds required is 0. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario. Specifically, the loop starts from the second element of the array, meaning that if `n` is 1, the loop will not execute, and `mx` will remain 0. Therefore, the function will incorrectly return 0 even though no operations are needed to make a single-element array non-decreasing.

To fix this, you can add a check before entering the loop to handle the case where `n` is 1. Here is the modified version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        mx = 0
        
        p = a[0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] < p:
                mx = max(mx, (p - a[i]).bit_length())
                a[i] = p
            p = a[i]
        
        func_2(mx)
```

With this modification, the code correctly handles the case where the array has only one element.
