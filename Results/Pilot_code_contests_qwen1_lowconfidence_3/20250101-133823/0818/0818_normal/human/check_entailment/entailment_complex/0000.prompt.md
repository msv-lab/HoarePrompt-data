You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have an array a of length n. For every positive integer x you are going to perform the following operation during the x-th second:

  * Select some distinct indices i_{1}, i_{2}, …, i_{k} which are between 1 and n inclusive, and add 2^{x-1} to each corresponding position of a. Formally, a_{i_{j}} := a_{i_{j}} + 2^{x-1} for j = 1, 2, …, k. Note that you are allowed to not select any indices at all.



You have to make a nondecreasing as fast as possible. Find the smallest number T such that you can make the array nondecreasing after at most T seconds.

Array a is nondecreasing if and only if a_{1} ≤ a_{2} ≤ … ≤ a_{n}.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}) — the length of array a. It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases in the input does not exceed 10^{5}.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_{1}, a_{2}, …, a_{n} (-10^{9} ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^{9}).

Output

For each test case, print the minimum number of seconds in which you can make a nondecreasing.

Example

Input


3
4
1 7 6 5
5
1 2 3 4 5
2
0 -4


Output


2
0
3

Note

In the first test case, if you select indices 3, 4 at the 1-st second and 4 at the 2-nd second, then a will become [1, 7, 7, 8]. There are some other possible ways to make a nondecreasing in 2 seconds, but you can't do it faster.

In the second test case, a is already nondecreasing, so answer is 0.

In the third test case, if you do nothing at first 2 seconds and select index 2 at the 3-rd second, a will become [0, 0].

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; n is a positive integer representing the length of the array a; a is a list of integers of length n where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each element a_i in the list a; mx is the maximum value calculated during the execution of the loop, representing the minimum number of seconds required to make the array non-decreasing.

        n = int(input())

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, `mx` is the maximum bit length difference between `a[0]` and any element in `a` up to index `n-1`, `p` is the last element processed in the loop and is equal to `a[n-1]`, `i` is `n`, and `func_2(mx)` has been called.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, then reads the array `a` itself. It calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the array non-decreasing by comparing each element with its predecessor. If an element is smaller than its predecessor, the difference in their values is recorded in terms of bit length, and the element is adjusted to match the predecessor. The maximum bit length difference found during this process is passed to another function `func_2`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include arrays with only one element, arrays where elements are already non-decreasing, and arrays with negative values. The function assumes that `t` is always a positive integer and `n` and the elements in `a` are within the specified bounds.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no direct relationship or variable from the given function `func_2` that contributes to solving the described problem. The function `func_2` prints values to a stream. The precondition should be derived from the problem description rather than the given function.
def func_2():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an iterable (possibly empty), `sep` is written to the file (if the iterable has more than one element), and the file contains a concatenated string of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`at_start` is `False`, `args` is an iterable (possibly empty), the file now contains a concatenated string of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `'\n'`, `kwargs` is `{}`, and the buffer of `file` has been flushed if the `flush` key in `kwargs` is `True`. Otherwise, the buffer remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and does not return any value. It prints a sequence of values from an iterable (`args`) to a stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), with each value separated by a specified separator (`sep`). After printing all values, it appends a newline character (`'\n'`) unless otherwise specified in the `end` keyword argument. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, the output buffer is flushed immediately. The function does not modify the input iterable (`args`) or the keyword arguments (`kwargs`). If the iterable is empty, no output is produced. Edge cases include handling an empty iterable, where no output is generated, and ensuring that the buffer is flushed if the `flush` keyword is set to `True`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
