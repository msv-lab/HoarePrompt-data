You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have an array a of length n. For every positive integer x you are going to perform the following operation during the x-th second:

  * Select some distinct indices i_{1}, i_{2}, …, i_{k} which are between 1 and n inclusive, and add 2^{x-1} to each corresponding position of a. Formally, a_{i_{j}} := a_{i_{j}} + 2^{x-1} for j = 1, 2, …, k. Note that you are allowed to not select any indices at all.



You have to make a nondecreasing as fast as possible. Find the smallest number T such that you can make the array nondecreasing after at most T seconds.

Array a is nondecreasing if and only if a_{1} ≤ a_{2} ≤ … ≤ a_{n}.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}) — the length of array a. It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases in the input does not exceed 10^{5}.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_{1}, a_{2}, …, a_{n} (-10^{9} ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^{9}).

Output

For each test case, print the minimum number of seconds in which you can make a nondecreasing.

Example

Input


3
4
1 7 6 5
5
1 2 3 4 5
2
0 -4


Output


2
0
3

Note

In the first test case, if you select indices 3, 4 at the 1-st second and 4 at the 2-nd second, then a will become [1, 7, 7, 8]. There are some other possible ways to make a nondecreasing in 2 seconds, but you can't do it faster.

In the second test case, a is already nondecreasing, so answer is 0.

In the third test case, if you do nothing at first 2 seconds and select index 2 at the 3-rd second, a will become [0, 0].
Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
import os
import sys
from io import BytesIO, IOBase
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        mx = 0
        p = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] < p:
                mx = max(mx, (p - a[i]).bit_length())
                a[i] = p
            p = a[i]
        func_2(mx)

#Function 2:
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of seconds required to make the array nondecreasing. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not properly handle the case where the array already needs more than one adjustment to become nondecreasing. 

Consider the following example:
Input:
```
3
4
1 7 6 5
5
1 2 3 4 5
2
0 -4
```

Expected Output:
```
2
0
3
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
2
0
3
```

For the third test case `[0, -4]`, the program calculates the maximum bit length difference between consecutive elements, which is 3. However, to make the array nondecreasing, we need to ensure that `-4` becomes `0` or higher, which requires only 1 operation (adding \(2^2 = 4\)). Therefore, the correct answer should be `1` instead of `3`.

The issue lies in the logic of `func_1` where it calculates the maximum bit length difference but does not ensure the correct sequence of operations to achieve the nondecreasing order in the minimum number of steps.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, `mx` is the maximum bit length difference between `a[0]` and any element in `a` up to index `n-1`, `p` is the last element processed in the loop and is equal to `a[n-1]`, `i` is `n`, and `func_2(mx)` has been called.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, then reads the array `a` itself. It calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the array non-decreasing by comparing each element with its predecessor. If an element is smaller than its predecessor, the difference in their values is recorded in terms of bit length, and the element is adjusted to match the predecessor. The maximum bit length difference found during this process is passed to another function `func_2`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include arrays with only one element, arrays where elements are already non-decreasing, and arrays with negative values. The function assumes that `t` is always a positive integer and `n` and the elements in `a` are within the specified bounds.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no direct relationship or variable from the given function `func_2` that contributes to solving the described problem. The function `func_2` prints values to a stream. The precondition should be derived from the problem description rather than the given function.

        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an iterable (possibly empty), `sep` is written to the file (if the iterable has more than one element), and the file contains a concatenated string of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`at_start` is `False`, `args` is an iterable (possibly empty), the file now contains a concatenated string of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `'\n'`, `kwargs` is `{}`, and the buffer of `file` has been flushed if the `flush` key in `kwargs` is `True`. Otherwise, the buffer remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and does not return any value. It prints a sequence of values from an iterable (`args`) to a stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), with each value separated by a specified separator (`sep`). After printing all values, it appends a newline character (`'\n'`) unless otherwise specified in the `end` keyword argument. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, the output buffer is flushed immediately. The function does not modify the input iterable (`args`) or the keyword arguments (`kwargs`). If the iterable is empty, no output is produced. Edge cases include handling an empty iterable, where no output is generated, and ensuring that the buffer is flushed if the `flush` keyword is set to `True`.
