Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code in `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum number of seconds required to make the array non-decreasing. Specifically, the code only adjusts elements to match their predecessors without considering the cumulative effect of future adjustments. This means that the code might not find the optimal solution in some cases.

For example, consider the test case:
```
t = 1
n = 4
a = [1, 7, 6, 5]
```

The code calculates the differences and finds the maximum bit length difference to be 2 (for the transition from 7 to 6 and 6 to 5). However, the correct solution requires 2 seconds to make the array non-decreasing:
1. At the 1st second, select indices 3 and 4 to make `a = [1, 7, 8, 10]`.
2. No further adjustments are needed in the 2nd second.

The current implementation, however, would incorrectly return 2 seconds because it only checks the immediate difference between consecutive elements and does not account for the cumulative effect of future adjustments.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence is incorrect.
