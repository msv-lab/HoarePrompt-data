Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of seconds required to make the array nondecreasing. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not properly handle the case where the array already needs more than one adjustment to become nondecreasing. 

Consider the following example:
Input:
```
3
4
1 7 6 5
5
1 2 3 4 5
2
0 -4
```

Expected Output:
```
2
0
3
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
2
0
3
```

For the third test case `[0, -4]`, the program calculates the maximum bit length difference between consecutive elements, which is 3. However, to make the array nondecreasing, we need to ensure that `-4` becomes `0` or higher, which requires only 1 operation (adding \(2^2 = 4\)). Therefore, the correct answer should be `1` instead of `3`.

The issue lies in the logic of `func_1` where it calculates the maximum bit length difference but does not ensure the correct sequence of operations to achieve the nondecreasing order in the minimum number of steps.
