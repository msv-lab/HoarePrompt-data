You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: You have an array a of length n. For every positive integer x you are going to perform the following operation during the x-th second:

  * Select some distinct indices i_{1}, i_{2}, …, i_{k} which are between 1 and n inclusive, and add 2^{x-1} to each corresponding position of a. Formally, a_{i_{j}} := a_{i_{j}} + 2^{x-1} for j = 1, 2, …, k. Note that you are allowed to not select any indices at all.



You have to make a nondecreasing as fast as possible. Find the smallest number T such that you can make the array nondecreasing after at most T seconds.

Array a is nondecreasing if and only if a_{1} ≤ a_{2} ≤ … ≤ a_{n}.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}) — the length of array a. It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases in the input does not exceed 10^{5}.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_{1}, a_{2}, …, a_{n} (-10^{9} ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^{9}).

Output

For each test case, print the minimum number of seconds in which you can make a nondecreasing.

Example

Input


3
4
1 7 6 5
5
1 2 3 4 5
2
0 -4


Output


2
0
3

Note

In the first test case, if you select indices 3, 4 at the 1-st second and 4 at the 2-nd second, then a will become [1, 7, 7, 8]. There are some other possible ways to make a nondecreasing in 2 seconds, but you can't do it faster.

In the second test case, a is already nondecreasing, so answer is 0.

In the third test case, if you do nothing at first 2 seconds and select index 2 at the 3-rd second, a will become [0, 0].
Program:
```
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
```
