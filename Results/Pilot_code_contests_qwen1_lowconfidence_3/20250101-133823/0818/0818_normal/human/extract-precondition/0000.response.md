Precondition: **There is no direct relationship or variable from the given function `func_2` that contributes to solving the described problem. The function `func_2` prints values to a stream. The precondition should be derived from the problem description rather than the given function.**

Based on the problem description, the correct precondition would be:

**t is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of n integers a_{1}, a_{2}, …, a_{n} (-10^9 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9). The sum of values of n over all test cases in the input does not exceed 10^5.**
