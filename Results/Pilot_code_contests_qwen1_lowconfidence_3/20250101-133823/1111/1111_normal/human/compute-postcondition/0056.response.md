The function `func_2(0)` is called with an argument of `0`. However, the function definition is not provided, so we cannot determine what changes this function will make to the variables. The only thing we know is that the function is called with `0` as an argument. Therefore, the values of `h`, `i`, `r[i]`, and `base[i][r[i]]` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`h` is at least 1 and within the range \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `i` is 0, `r[i]` is less than `w` and the value of `base[i][r[i]]` is 1**
