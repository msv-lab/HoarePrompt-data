The function `func_2(0)` is called with an argument of `0`. However, the function itself is not defined in the provided code snippet. Therefore, no changes are made to the variables `h`, `i`, `r`, `c`, or `base` based on the given information.

Output State: **`h` is at least 1 and within the range \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `i` is within the range \(0 \leq i < w\), `r[i]` is not less than `w` or `base[i][r[i]]` is not equal to 1, `c[i]` is less than `h` and `base[c[i]][i]` equals 1.**
