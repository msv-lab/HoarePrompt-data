According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `ci`. If `j` is less than `ci`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `base[j][0]` is 1 for `j` in `range(ci)`, `base[0][1]` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `ci` is a non-negative integer. Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1, after the last iteration, `j` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `ci`. Given that `j` is currently 0, the loop can only execute one more time if `j` becomes 1. Therefore, `j` must be incremented to 1 for the loop to continue.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`base[j][0]` is 1 for `j` in `range(ci)`, `base[0][1]` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `ci` must be a non-negative integer**
