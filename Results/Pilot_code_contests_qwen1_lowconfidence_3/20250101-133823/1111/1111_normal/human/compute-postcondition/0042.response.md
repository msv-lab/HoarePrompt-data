According to the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time.

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `base[j][0]` is 1 for `j` in `range(ci)`
   - `base[0][1]` is 1
   - `base[1][1]` is 1
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is 1
   - `ci` is a non-negative integer

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The for loop iterates over `j` in the range `range(ci)`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `ci`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to 2 (the next value in the range).

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `j` needs to be 2 for the loop to execute again.
   - Since `j` is incremented within the loop, `i` does not change in this context, so it remains 1.
   - The values of `base[j][0]`, `base[0][1]`, and `base[1][1]` do not change as they are not affected by the loop itself.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The only adjustment needed is to set `j` to 2.

**State: **`base[j][0]` is 1 for `j` in `range(ci)`, `base[0][1]` is 1, `base[1][1]` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ci` is a non-negative integer**
