According to the given code and the initial state, we need to analyze the conditions for the loop to execute again. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `h` is at least 1 and within the range \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\).
   - `i` is within the range \(0 \leq i < w\).
   - `r[i]` is not less than `w` or `base[i][r[i]]` is not equal to 1.
   - The loop does not return None and continues executing if none of the conditions inside the loop are met.
   - The condition \((c[i] \geq h \text{ or } base[c[i]][i] \neq 1)\) holds true.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `w-1`.
   - For each iteration, the loop body is executed.
   - The loop continues as long as the condition \((c[i] \geq h \text{ or } base[c[i]][i] \neq 1)\) holds true and no other conditions cause the function to return `None`.

3. **State After the Previous Iteration**:
   - The loop has just completed an iteration with some value of `i`.
   - The condition \((c[i] \geq h \text{ or } base[c[i]][i] \neq 1)\) holds true for this iteration.
   - Since the loop did not return `None`, the next iteration can proceed.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be \(i + 1\).

5. **Adjusted States**:
   - `h` remains the same since it does not change within the loop.
   - `i` increases by 1, so the new value of `i` is \(i + 1\).
   - The condition \((c[i] \geq h \text{ or } base[c[i]][i] \neq 1)\) must still hold true for the next iteration to continue.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`h` is at least 1 and within the range \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `i` is within the range \(0 \leq i < w\) and is now \(i + 1\), `r[i+1]` is not less than `w` or `base[i+1][r[i+1]]` is not equal to 1, and the condition \((c[i+1] \geq h \text{ or } base[c[i+1]][i+1] \neq 1)\) holds true.**
