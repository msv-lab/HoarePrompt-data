The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State remains as follows:

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 <= h <= 10^3, `w` is an integer such that 1 <= w <= 10^3, `r` is a list of `h` integers where 0 <= `r[i]` <= `w` for all 0 <= i < `h`, `c` is a list of `w` integers where 0 <= `c[j]` <= `h` for all 0 <= j < `w`, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`**
