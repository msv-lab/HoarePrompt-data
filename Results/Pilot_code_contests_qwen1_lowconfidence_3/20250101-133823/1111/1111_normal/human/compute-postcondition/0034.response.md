Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `base[0][0]` is 1
   - `base[1][0]` is 1
   - `i` is 0
   - `j` is 1

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(ci):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from 0 up to `ci - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - Since the loop is iterating over `j` and `j` starts from 0, the loop will continue if `j` is less than `ci`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `base[0][0]` remains 1.
   - `base[1][0]` remains 1.
   - `i` remains 0 because the loop is iterating over `j`.
   - `j` needs to be 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`base[0][0]` is 1, `base[1][0]` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
