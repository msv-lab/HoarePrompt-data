The function call `func_2(pow(2, n, 1000000007))` is made, which means `func_2` is called with the argument `pow(2, n, 1000000007)`. The value of `pow(2, n, 1000000007)` is calculated, but the exact value depends on the value of `n`. However, the function `func_2` is called with this value, and the function itself is not defined in the provided code snippet. Since no further details about `func_2` are given, we can only state that `func_2` is invoked with the computed value.

Other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. 

Output State: **`h` is at least 1 and within the range \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `i` is within the range \(0 \leq i < w\), `r[i]` satisfies either `r[i] >= w` or `base[i][r[i]] != 1`, `n` remains as the original `n`, `func_2` is called with `pow(2, n, 1000000007)` as its argument.**
