Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `args` must have at least one element.
   - `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\).
   - `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\).
   - `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r[i] \leq w\) for all \(0 \leq i < h\).
   - `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c[j] \leq h\) for all \(0 \leq j < w\).
   - `sep` is ' '.
   - `file` is `sys.stdout`.
   - `x` is the next element from `args`.
   - `sys.stdout` now contains the string representation of `x` followed by a space and then the string representation of `x` again.
   - `at_start` is `False`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over each element in `args`. The condition for the loop to continue is that there are more elements in `args` to process.

3. **Current State After Previous Iteration:**
   - Since `at_start` is `False`, it means this is not the first iteration. The current state indicates that `x` is the next element from `args` (after the previous iteration).

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - `args` must still have at least one element left to process. Since `x` was taken from `args` in the previous iteration, `args` should now have one less element.
   - `h` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify this value.
   - `w` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify this value.
   - `r` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify this value.
   - `c` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify this value.
   - `sep` remains ' ' as the loop does not modify this value.
   - `file` remains `sys.stdout` as the loop does not modify this value.
   - `x` will be the next element from `args`.
   - `at_start` remains `False` as the loop has not started another iteration yet.

5. **Final State for Next Iteration:**
   - `args` must have at least one element left to process (i.e., `len(args) > 0`).
   - `x` will be the next element from `args`.
   - `at_start` remains `False`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

**State: **`args` must have at least one element left to process, `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\), `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r[i] \leq w\) for all \(0 \leq i < h\), `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c[j] \leq h\) for all \(0 \leq j < w\), `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `x` will be the next element from `args`, `at_start` is `False`.**
