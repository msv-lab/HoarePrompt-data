`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`, which in this case is `sys.stdout`. This means a new value will be written to `sys.stdout`, appending `str(x)` to whatever was already there.

- The initial state of `sys.stdout` ends with a space (`sys.stdout` contains a space).
- Writing `str(x)` to `sys.stdout` appends `str(x)` to the existing content of `sys.stdout`.

Therefore, the updated content of `sys.stdout` will be the original content plus `str(x)`, ending with the character `str(x)`.

Output State: **`args` must have at least one element left to process, `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\), `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r[i] \leq w\) for all \(0 \leq i < h\), `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c[j] \leq h\) for all \(0 \leq j < w\), `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `x` will be the next element from `args`, `at_start` is `False`, and `sys.stdout` contains its original content followed by `str(x)`.
