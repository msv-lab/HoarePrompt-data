Output State: **`h` is at least 1 and within the range \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `i` is within the range \(0 \leq i < w\), `r[i]` is not less than `w` or `base[i][r[i]]` is not equal to 1, the function either returns `None` if any condition inside the loop is met or continues without returning anything if none of the conditions are met, and if the loop does not execute, then `h`, `i`, and `base` are as they were initially.** 

### Explanation:
- **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` in the range `0` to `w-1`. For each iteration, it checks if `c[i] < h` and if `base[c[i]][i] == 1`. If both conditions are met, the function `func_2(0)` is called and the function returns immediately.
- **Output After Loop Execution**: After the loop completes its iterations, there are two possible scenarios:
  - **Scenario 1 (Loop Executes):** If the loop executes at least once, it means that for at least one index `i`, the conditions `c[i] < h` and `base[c[i]][i] == 1` were met, causing the function to return `None`. The loop stops after finding the first such `i`.
  - **Scenario 2 (Loop Does Not Execute):** If the loop does not execute, it means that for all `i` in the range `0` to `w-1`, the conditions `c[i] < h` and `base[c[i]][i] == 1` were not met. Therefore, the loop continues to the end without returning anything, and the function remains in its current state.

Given these scenarios, the final state of the variables will be consistent with the conditions described above. If the loop does not execute, the values of `h`, `i`, and `base` remain unchanged from their initial state.
