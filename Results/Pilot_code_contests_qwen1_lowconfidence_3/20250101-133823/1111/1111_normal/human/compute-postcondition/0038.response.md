Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Their Initial Values**:
   - The loop variable `j` is defined in the range of `ci`.
   - Before the loop starts, `base[j][0]` is set to 1 for `j` in `range(ci)`.
   - Additionally, `i` is 1 and `j` is `ci - 1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop `for j in range(ci)` will execute as long as `j` takes values from 0 to `ci-1`.

3. **Analyze the Given States**:
   - `base[j][0]` is 1 for `j` in `range(ci)`: This means that for each `j` in the range of `ci`, `base[j][0]` is initialized to 1.
   - `i` is 1: This state is already given and does not affect the loop condition.
   - `j` is `ci - 1`: This means `j` starts at `ci - 1`, which means the loop won't start because `j` would already be outside the valid range `[0, ci-1]`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - To ensure the loop can start executing, `j` should start at 0 (the beginning of the range).
   - Since `j` is initially set to `ci - 1`, we need to adjust this value to 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be 0 instead of `ci - 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`base[j][0]` is 1 for `j` in `range(ci)`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `ci` must be a non-negative integer**
