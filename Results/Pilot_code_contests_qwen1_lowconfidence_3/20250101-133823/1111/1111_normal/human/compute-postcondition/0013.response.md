The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State, except for the addition of the new variable `at_start`.

Output State: **`args` must have at least one element, `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\), `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r[i] \leq w\) for all \(0 \leq i < h\), `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c[j] \leq h\) for all \(0 \leq j < w\), `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `x` is the next element from `args`, `sys.stdout` now contains the string representation of `x` followed by a space and then the string representation of `x` again, `at_start` is `False`.**
