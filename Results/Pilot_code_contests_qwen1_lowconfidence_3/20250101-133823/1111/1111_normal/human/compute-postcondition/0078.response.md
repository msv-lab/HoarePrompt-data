The function `func_2(0)` is called, but the implementation of `func_2` is not provided. Since the function is not defined, it's impossible to determine what changes will occur to the variables. However, based on the given initial state, no variables are modified by calling an undefined function. 

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`h` is unchanged, `i` is `k + 1`, `r[k + 2]` is unchanged, `c[k + 2]` is unchanged, and the conditions regarding `base` remain unchanged.**
