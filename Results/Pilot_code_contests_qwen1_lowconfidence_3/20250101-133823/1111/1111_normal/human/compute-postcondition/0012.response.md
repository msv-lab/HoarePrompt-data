The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`, which in this case is `sys.stdout`. This means that the string representation of `x` will be printed to the standard output followed by the current value of `sep` (which is ' '), unless `at_start` is `True`, in which case no separator is added.

Since the initial state includes `sys.stdout` containing the string representation of `x` followed by a space if `at_start` is `False`, writing `str(x)` to `sys.stdout` will add another `str(x)` to `sys.stdout` without any additional separator.

Therefore, the updated state of `sys.stdout` will be twice the string representation of `x` separated by a space.

Output State: **`args` must have at least one element, `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\), `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r[i] \leq w\) for all \(0 \leq i < h\), `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c[j] \leq h\) for all \(0 \leq j < w\), `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `x` is the next element from `args`, `sys.stdout` now contains the string representation of `x` followed by a space and then the string representation of `x` again.**
