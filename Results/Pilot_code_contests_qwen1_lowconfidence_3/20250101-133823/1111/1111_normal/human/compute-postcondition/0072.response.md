Postcondition: **`h` is at least 1 and within the range \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `i` is within the range \(0 \leq i < w\), `r[i]` is not less than `w` or `base[i][r[i]]` is not equal to 1, the function either returns None if any condition inside the loop is met or continues without returning anything if none of the conditions are met, and the condition `(c[i] >= h or base[c[i]][i] != 1)` holds true**
