The code `base[j][i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the element at index `j` of the list `base[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `base[j][0]` is `1` for `j` in `range(ci)`
- `base[0][1]` is `1`
- `base[1][1]` is `1`
- `i` is `1`
- `j` is `2`
- `ci` is a non-negative integer

Since `i` is `1` and `j` is `2`, the code updates `base[1][2]` to `1`.

Output State: **`base[j][0]` is 1 for `j` in `range(ci)`, `base[0][1]` is 1, `base[1][1]` is 1, `base[1][2]` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ci` is a non-negative integer**
