Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\), `r` is a list of `h` integers where each integer is between \(0\) and `w`, `c` is a list of integers where each integer is an input integer from the user, `base` is a 2D list of size `h` by `w` filled with zeros except for the elements `base[i][j]` which are `1` for all pairs `(i, j)` where `i` ranges from `0` to `h-1` and `j` ranges from `0` to `ri[i]-1`, `i` is `h`, `ri` is the last element of `r` and must be greater than `0`, `j` is `ri - 1`.**
