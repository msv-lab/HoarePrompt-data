Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `h` is at least 1 and within the range \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is 0.
- `r[i]` is not less than `w` or `base[i][r[i]]` is not equal to 1.

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(h):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = h - 1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and goes up to `h - 1`, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.

### Adjusting the States:
- **Variable `i`**: It needs to be updated to 1.
- **Condition Check**: We need to ensure that the condition `r[i]` is not less than `w` or `base[i][r[i]]` is not equal to 1 still holds true for `i = 1`.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be 1. Therefore, we need to check if the condition for `i = 1` is satisfied.

### Updated State:
- `h` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `i` is now 1.
- `r[1]` should be checked to ensure it is not less than `w` or `base[1][r[1]]` is not equal to 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`h` is at least 1 and within the range \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `i` is 1, `r[1]` is not less than `w` or `base[1][r[1]]` is not equal to 1**
