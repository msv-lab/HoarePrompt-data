Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `w` must be at least 2.
   - `r[i]` must satisfy either `r[i] >= w` or `base[i][r[i]] != 1`.
   - `n` is correctly defined.
   - `0 \leq i < h-1`.
   - `n` is increased by 1 if `r[i] < j and c[j] < i` is true.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, w):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `1` to `w-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, we know the values of `w`, `r[i]`, `n`, and the condition for `n` being incremented.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be in the range `[1, w)`. Since the loop just finished its previous iteration, `j` was the highest value it could have been without going out of bounds. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased to the next value in the range, which is `j = w`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `j` is now `w`, we need to ensure that `j` starts from `w` in the next iteration.
   - The condition for `n` being incremented (`r[i] < j and c[j] < i`) will not affect the initial setup for the loop because `j` is starting from `w` now.
   - The other conditions remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Final State:**
   - `w` remains the same (must be at least 2).
   - `r[i]` must satisfy either `r[i] >= w` or `base[i][r[i]] != 1`.
   - `n` is correctly defined.
   - `0 \leq i < h-1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must be `w`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`w` must be at least 2, `r[i]` must satisfy either `r[i] >= w` or `base[i][r[i]] != 1`, `n` is correctly defined, `0 \leq i < h-1`, `j` is `w**.
