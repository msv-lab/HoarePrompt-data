Output State: **`args` must be empty, `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\), `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r[i] \leq w\) for all \(0 \leq i < h\), `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c[j] \leq h\) for all \(0 \leq j < w\), `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `x` is the last element from `args`, `sys.stdout` contains the string representation of each element in `args` concatenated together with the separator `sep`, `at_start` is `False`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: `h` and `w` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `r` and `c` are lists of integers, `sep` is a space character, `file` is the standard output, and `at_start` is initially `True`.

2. **Loop Operation**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `args`.
   - For each iteration, if `at_start` is `False`, `sep` is written to `file`.
   - The string representation of `x` (current element) is written to `file`.
   - `at_start` is set to `False`.

3. **After Loop Execution**:
   - Since the loop continues until `args` is exhausted, after all elements in `args` have been processed, `args` will be empty.
   - Each element in `args` is written to `file` with the separator `sep` except for the first element, making `at_start` always `False`.
   - `at_start` remains `False` because once the first element is processed, `at_start` is set to `False`.

4. **Final State**:
   - All elements in `args` have been processed.
   - `args` is now empty.
   - `sys.stdout` contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`.
   - `at_start` is `False`.

This ensures that all elements in `args` are processed and concatenated correctly with the separator `sep`, and `at_start` is `False` indicating that no additional separators need to be added.
