To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Initialization:**
   - The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = w-1`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute, `w` must be at least 2 (since the loop starts at `j = 1`).

2. **Initial States:**
   - `h` is at least 1 and within the range \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\).
   - `i` is `old_i + 1` and must be within the range \(0 \leq i < h-1\).
   - `r[i]` is not less than `w` or `base[i][r[i]]` is not equal to 1.
   - `n` is the count of `j` such that `r[i] < j` and `c[j] < i` for all `1 \leq j < w`.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will run as long as `j` is in the range `[1, w)`.

### Required Adjustments:

1. **`w` must be at least 2:**
   - Since the loop starts at `j = 1`, `w` must be at least 2 to allow the loop to run at least once.

2. **`r[i]` and `base[i][r[i]]`:**
   - `r[i]` must satisfy either `r[i] >= w` or `base[i][r[i]] != 1`.
   - This condition must hold true for the loop to proceed.

3. **Count `n`:**
   - `n` is defined as the count of `j` such that `r[i] < j` and `c[j] < i` for all `1 \leq j < w`.
   - This condition ensures that there are valid indices `j` for the loop to iterate over.

4. **`i` and `old_i`:**
   - `i` must be within the range \(0 \leq i < h-1\).
   - Since `i` is initialized as `old_i + 1`, we need to ensure that `old_i + 1` falls within the valid range.

### Final State:

Given the above analysis, the required states to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `w` must be at least 2.
- `r[i]` must satisfy either `r[i] >= w` or `base[i][r[i]] != 1`.
- `n` is defined correctly based on the given conditions.
- `i` must be within the range \(0 \leq i < h-1\).

### Final Answer:

State: **`w` must be at least 2, `r[i]` must satisfy either `r[i] >= w` or `base[i][r[i]] != 1`, `n` is correctly defined, `0 \leq i < h-1`**
