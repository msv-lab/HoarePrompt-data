According to the code, the loop condition is determined by the variable `j` and `ci`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `ci`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `base[0][0]` is 1
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 0
- `ci` must be greater than 0

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.
- `ci` must still be greater than 0 to allow the loop to continue.

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`base[0][0]` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ci` must be greater than 0**
