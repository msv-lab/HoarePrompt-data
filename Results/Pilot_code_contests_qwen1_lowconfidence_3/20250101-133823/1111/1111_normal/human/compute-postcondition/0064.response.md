The function `func_2(0)` is called, but the details of the function `func_2` are not provided in the initial state or the code snippet. Without knowing what `func_2` does, we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the variables. However, based on the provided information, the following preconditions remain unchanged:

- `h` is at least 1 and within the range \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is 2.
- `r[1]` is not less than `w` or `base[1][r[1]]` is not equal to 1.

Since we don't know what `func_2(0)` does, we can only state that it may have modified some local or global variables, but the specified variables `h`, `i`, `r[1]`, and `w` or `base[1][r[1]]` remain unchanged according to the given conditions.

Output State: **`h` is at least 1 and within the range \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\); `i` is 2; `r[1]` is not less than `w` or `base[1][r[1]]` is not equal to 1.**
