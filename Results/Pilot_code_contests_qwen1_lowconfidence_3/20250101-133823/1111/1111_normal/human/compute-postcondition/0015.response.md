`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is ' ') to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). This does not change the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `args` must have at least one element left to process, `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\), `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r[i] \leq w\) for all \(0 \leq i < h\), `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c[j] \leq h\) for all \(0 \leq j < w\), `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `x` will be the next element from `args`, `at_start` is `False`. The file `sys.stdout` now contains a space.
