Output State: **`h` is at least 1 and within the range \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `i` is `h`, for every `i` in `range(h)`, `r[i]` is not less than `w` or `base[i][r[i]]` is not equal to 1, the function either returns `None` if any condition inside the loop is met or continues without returning anything if none of the conditions are met.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial Values and Constraints**: 
  - `h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\).
  - `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\).
  - `r` is a list of `h` integers where each integer is between \(0\) and `w`.
  - `c` is a list of integers where each integer is an input integer from the user.
  - `ri` is the last element of `r` and must be greater than `0`.

- **Loop Execution**:
  - The loop iterates over each index `i` in the range `[0, h)`.
  - For each iteration, it checks if `r[i] < w` and `base[i][r[i]] == 1`.
  - If both conditions are met, the function `func_2(0)` is called, and the function returns `None`.
  - If neither condition is met, the loop continues to the next iteration.

- **Final State**:
  - After the loop completes, `i` will be `h`, indicating that the loop has executed for all indices in the range `[0, h)`.
  - If the loop did not encounter any indices `i` where `r[i] < w` and `base[i][r[i]] == 1`, the function will continue without returning anything.
  - If any index `i` met the condition, the function would have returned `None` at that point.

Thus, the final state of the variables is as described above.
