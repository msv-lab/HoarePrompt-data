Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\), `r` must have at least three elements, `c` is a list of integers where each integer is an input integer from the user, `base` is a 2D list of size `h` by `w` filled with zeros except for the elements `base[0][0]` to `base[0][ri_next-1]` which are 1, and `base[1][ri_next-1]` is 1, `i` is `ri_next + 1`, `ri` is the third element of `r` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `ri_next + ri - 1`, `base[i][j]` is 1 for all `j` from `ri_next` to `ri_next + ri - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `j` from `ri_next` to `ri - 1`.
- Each iteration sets `base[i][j]` to 1.
- Therefore, after the loop completes, `base[i][j]` will be 1 for all `j` from `ri_next` to `ri_next + ri - 1`.

Since `i` is initially set to `ri_next + 1`, and the loop runs `ri` times, the final value of `j` will be `ri_next + ri - 1`.

Hence, the final state of the variables after the loop executes all iterations is as described above.
