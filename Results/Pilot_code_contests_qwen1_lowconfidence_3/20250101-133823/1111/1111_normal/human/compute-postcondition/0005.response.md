The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is `' '`), to the file object `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). This does not change the values of any variables other than potentially flushing the output buffer to the console. The initial values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` must have at least one element, `h` is an integer such that 1 <= h <= 10^3, `w` is an integer such that 1 <= w <= 10^3, `r` is a list of `h` integers where 0 <= `r[i]` <= `w` for all 0 <= i < `h`, `c` is a list of `w` integers where 0 <= `c[j]` <= `h` for all 0 <= j < `w`, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `sys.stdout` has a space written to it.**
