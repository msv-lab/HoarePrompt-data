Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States Given:**
   - `w` must be at least 2.
   - `r[2]` must satisfy either `r[2] >= w` or `base[2][r[2]] != 1`.
   - `n` is the count of `j` such that `r[2] < j` and `c[j] < 2` for all `1 ≤ j < w`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, w):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = w-1`.
   - For the loop to run, `w` must be at least 2, which is already given.

4. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `w` must be at least 2, this condition is already covered.
   - We need to ensure that `j` values within the loop (i.e., `1 ≤ j < w`) meet the conditions derived from the initial states.

5. **Conditions Derived from Initial States:**
   - For each `j` in the loop, `r[2]` must satisfy either `r[2] >= w` or `base[2][r[2]] != 1`.
   - For `n` to be valid, `r[2] < j` and `c[j] < 2` for all `1 ≤ j < w` should hold true.

6. **State After Loop Starts:**
   - When the loop starts, `j` will take values from `1` to `w-1`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that for each `j` in this range, the conditions on `r[2]` and `c[j]` are met.

Given these points, we can adjust the states as follows:

- For each `j` in the range `1` to `w-1`, `r[2]` must satisfy either `r[2] >= w` or `base[2][r[2]] != 1`.
- For each `j` in the range `1` to `w-1`, `c[j]` must be less than 2.

Since the conditions must hold for each `j` in the range, we can summarize the required states as:

**State:**
- `w` must be at least 2.
- `r[2]` must satisfy either `r[2] >= w` or `base[2][r[2]] != 1` for all `j` in the range `1` to `w-1`.
- `c[j] < 2` for all `j` in the range `1` to `w-1`.

This ensures that the loop can execute for each value of `j` in the specified range.
