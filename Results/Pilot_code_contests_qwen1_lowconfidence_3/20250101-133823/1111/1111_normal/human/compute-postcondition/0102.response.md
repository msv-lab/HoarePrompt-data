To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given and follow the logic step by step.

### Given Information:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `w` must be at least 2.
   - `r[2]` must satisfy either `r[2] >= w` or `base[2][r[2]] != 1`.
   - `n` is updated based on the condition `r[i] < j and c[j] < i` for each `j` in the range `1` to `w-1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, w):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   The loop will execute if `j` is in the range `1` to `w-1`. This means `j` starts from `1` and goes up to `w-1`.

2. **Current State at the Start of the Current Iteration:**
   - `w` is at least 2.
   - `r[2]` satisfies either `r[2] >= w` or `base[2][r[2]] != 1`.
   - `n` has been updated based on the condition `r[i] < j and c[j] < i` for each `j` in the range `1` to `w-1`.

3. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `j` starting from `1` to `w-1`, the first value of `j` is `1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be within the range `1` to `w-1`. Therefore, `w` must remain at least 2 (since if `w` were less than 2, the range would be invalid).
   - The condition for `r[2]` remains the same as it is already checked.
   - `n` needs to be updated based on the condition `r[i] < j and c[j] < i` for each new `j` in the range `1` to `w-1`. However, since we are starting the loop, `n` will be updated based on the current `j` which is `1`.

### Updated States for the Start of the Next Iteration:

- `w` must still be at least 2.
- `r[2]` must still satisfy either `r[2] >= w` or `base[2][r[2]] != 1`.
- `n` will be updated based on the condition `r[i] < 1 and c[1] < i` (since `j = 1`).

### Final Output State:

```plaintext
State: **`w` must be at least 2, `r[2]` must satisfy either `r[2] >= w` or `base[2][r[2]] != 1`, `n` is updated based on the condition `r[i] < 1 and c[1] < i`**
```

This ensures that the loop can continue executing with the appropriate conditions.
