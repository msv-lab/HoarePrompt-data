The given code snippet is a docstring comment and does not contain any executable statements that would alter the state of the variables. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **h is an integer such that 1 <= h <= 10^3, w is an integer such that 1 <= w <= 10^3, r is a list of h integers where 0 <= r[i] <= w for all 0 <= i < h, c is a list of w integers where 0 <= c[j] <= h for all 0 <= j < w.**
