Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `base[j][0]` is 1 for `j` in `range(ci + 1)`
   - `base[2][i]` is 1
   - `j` is 2
   - `ci` is greater than 0

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` in `range(ci)`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
   - Since the loop condition is `range(ci)`, the loop will only execute as long as `j < ci`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become 3.
   - However, for the loop to continue, `j` must still be less than `ci`.
   - This means `ci` must be greater than or equal to 3.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - `base[j][0]` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted, but `j` changes.
   - `base[2][i]` remains 1 because `i` is not modified by the loop.
   - `j` changes from 2 to 3.
   - `ci` must be greater than or equal to 3 to allow the loop to continue.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`base[j][0]` is 1 for `j` in `range(ci + 1)`, `base[2][i]` is 1, `j` is 3, `ci` is greater than or equal to 3**
