The function `func_2` accepts no explicit parameters directly listed in its definition (`def func_2():`). However, it indirectly depends on the existence of four global lists or variables: `h`, `w`, `r`, and `c`. These variables are constrained as follows:
- `h` and `w` are integers such that \(1 \leq h, w \leq 10^3\).
- `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r[i] \leq w\) for all \(0 \leq i < h\).
- `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c[j] \leq h\) for all \(0 \leq j < w\).

Given the described constraints and relationships, the function does not explicitly define any return values within the provided context.

Functionality: **The function accepts the existence of global variables `h`, `w`, `r`, and `c` with specified constraints, and returns no explicit value.**
