Postcondition: ***`args` is empty, `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\), `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r[i] \leq w\) for all \(0 \leq i < h\), `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c[j] \leq h\) for all \(0 \leq j < w\), `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `x` is the last element from `args`, `sys.stdout` contains a newline character, `at_start` is `False`. If the `kwargs` dictionary had a 'flush' key with a value of `True`, `sys.stdout` is flushed. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
