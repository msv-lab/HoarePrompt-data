Postcondition: ***`args` must have at least one element, `h` is an integer such that 1 <= h <= 10^3, `w` is an integer such that 1 <= w <= 10^3, `r` is a list of `h` integers where 0 <= `r[i]` <= `w` for all 0 <= i < `h`, `c` is a list of `w` integers where 0 <= `c[j]` <= `h` for all 0 <= j < `w`, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`. If `at_start` is `False` before the if statement, `sys.stdout` has a space written to it. Otherwise, no change to the state of the program.***
