The function `func_2(0)` is called, but the definition of `func_2` is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine what changes, if any, this function call will make to the variables `h`, `i`, `r`, `base`, and `c`. Since no variables are explicitly updated or modified within the given code snippet, the preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is at least 1 and within the range \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `i` is within the range \(0 \leq i < w\) and is now \(i + 1\), `r[i+1]` is not less than `w` or `base[i+1][r[i+1]]` is not equal to 1, and the condition \((c[i+1] \geq h \text{ or } base[c[i+1]][i+1] \neq 1)\) holds true.**
