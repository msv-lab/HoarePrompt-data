The function `func_2(0)` is called, but since the implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes it will make to the variables. However, based on the initial state and the information provided, we know that the following conditions hold:

- `h` is at least 1 and within the range \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\)
- `i` is 1
- `r[1]` is not less than `w` or `base[1][r[1]]` is not equal to 1

Since the exact behavior of `func_2` is unknown, we cannot determine the new values of the variables after its execution. Therefore, we can only state that the function has been called.

Output State: **`h` is at least 1 and within the range \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\); `i` is 1; `r[1]` is not less than `w` or `base[1][r[1]]` is not equal to 1; `func_2(0)` has been called.**
