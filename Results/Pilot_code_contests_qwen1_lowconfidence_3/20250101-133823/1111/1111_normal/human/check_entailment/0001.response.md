Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to satisfy the values of `r` and `c`. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the grid can be filled according to the given constraints. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
2 2
1 1
1 1
```

According to the problem description, each row and each column should start with exactly one full cell. However, the provided program will not correctly handle this case. 

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of why the program fails:
1. For the first row, `r[0] = 1`, meaning the first cell in the first row should be full.
2. For the first column, `c[0] = 1`, meaning the first cell in the first column should be full.
3. This implies that both the first cell in the first row and the first cell in the first column must be full, which is not possible since it would violate the condition that each row and column starts with exactly one full cell.

The program does not check for these kinds of contradictions and thus cannot correctly determine whether a valid grid can be constructed. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this specific case and others like it.
