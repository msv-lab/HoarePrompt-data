Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Initialization and Setting Up the Grid:**
   - The program initializes a grid `base` and sets the first `ri` columns to full (1) for each row `i` and the first `cj` rows to full (1) for each column `j`.
   - This part of the code correctly sets up the initial constraints given by `r` and `c`.

2. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if there is any conflict between the constraints `r` and `c`. Specifically, it checks if any row or column violates the constraints set by `r` and `c` after setting the initial grid.
     - For each row `i`, if `r[i]` is less than `w` and `base[i][r[i]]` is 1, it calls `func_2(0)` and returns immediately. This indicates that there is a conflict.
     - For each column `j`, if `c[j]` is less than `h` and `base[c[j]][j]` is 1, it also calls `func_2(0)` and returns immediately. This indicates another conflict.
   - These checks are unnecessary because the setup of the grid already ensures that no conflicts arise. Therefore, these checks are redundant and do not contribute to solving the problem correctly.

3. **Counting Valid Configurations:**
   - The program counts the number of positions where `r[i] < j` and `c[j] < i`. This step is meant to calculate the number of ways to place additional full cells in the grid.
   - However, this counting step is flawed because it does not ensure that the final grid configuration respects both `r` and `c` constraints. It simply counts positions where placing a full cell would be consistent with the constraints, but it does not enforce these constraints during the counting process.

4. **Using `func_2` to Calculate the Result:**
   - The function `func_2` is used to compute \(2^n \mod (10^9 + 7)\), where `n` is the count obtained in the previous step.
   - This function is correctly implemented and uses modular exponentiation to compute the result.

### Conclusion:
The main issue lies in the logic used to count the valid configurations. The current approach does not guarantee that the final grid respects the constraints `r` and `c`. To solve this problem correctly, one needs to use dynamic programming or backtracking to ensure that the constraints are respected throughout the construction of the grid.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description requirements and hence is marked as **False**.
