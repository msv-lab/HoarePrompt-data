Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the constraints and logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not properly check all conditions and does not account for all possible configurations of the grid that could satisfy the given `r` and `c` values. 

For instance, consider the following input:

```
3 3
2 1 0
0 2 2
```

The program should find the number of ways to fill the 3x3 grid such that each row and column matches the specified `r` and `c` values. However, the current implementation does not fully handle the logic needed to ensure all cells are correctly filled according to the given constraints. The program might miss valid configurations or incorrectly count invalid ones.

A correct solution would need to ensure that the grid can be filled in a way that satisfies both `r` and `c` constraints simultaneously. The provided code does not thoroughly validate or construct such a grid, leading to potentially incorrect results.
