#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of districts, an integer `k` representing the number of contestants to be removed, and a list of tuples `edges` representing the bidirectional roads between districts. It constructs a binary tree representation of the graph using the given edges and then removes `k` contestants (districts) by marking their nodes in the tree. The function ensures that the remaining nodes form a valid binary tree structure and outputs the indices of the nodes that are not marked for removal.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^6, representing the number of districts and the number of contestants to remove, respectively. edges is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers a and b representing a road connecting districts a and b.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` reads input values for the number of districts `n`, the number of contestants to remove `k`, and a list of edges connecting districts from standard input. It then calls another function `func_1(n, k, edges)` with these parameters. After executing `func_1`, the function does not return any value but ensures that the program state includes the processed `n`, `k`, and `edges`. However, it does not specify what actions `func_1` performs, which could involve removing certain contestants or adjusting the connectivity between districts. Since the code does not provide any further details about the state after `func_1` is called, the final state of the program will depend on the actions taken within `func_1`. Potential edge cases include invalid inputs for `n` and `k`, such as when `k` is non-positive or `k` is not less than `n`, or when `edges` do not form a valid graph structure.
