The code assigns the value of `u` to `storage[storage_index + 1]`. The value of `u` is represented by `storage[4]`, which is `u_new`. Therefore, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is now `u_new`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage[0]` is `lookup[u_new]`, `storage[1]` is `v_new`, `storage[2]` is `-1`, `storage[3]` is `1` or `-1` depending on whether `v_new == u_new`, `storage[4]` is `u_new`, `storage[9]` is `1` or `3`, `storage[10]` is `v_new`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u_new`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is `lookup[v]`**
