`new_nodes` appends the value of `p` to itself. Since `new_nodes` initially contains `[p]`, after appending `p`, `new_nodes` will become `[p, p]`. The values of other variables (`index`, `abort`, `flag`, `count`, `i`, `p`) are not affected.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p, p]`, `index` is `nodes[p]`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` based on `flag == -1`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`, `count` retains its value, `i` retains its value, `p` is `index * 2`.**
