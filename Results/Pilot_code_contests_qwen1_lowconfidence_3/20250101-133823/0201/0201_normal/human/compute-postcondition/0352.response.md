The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of districts, with the constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
- `k` is an integer representing the number of contestants to be removed, with the constraint \(1 \leq k < n\).
- `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple \((u, v)\) represents a bidirectional road connecting districts \(u\) and \(v\), with the constraints \(1 \leq u, v \leq n\) and \(u \neq v\).

The function returns a value based on the specified conditions. However, since the specific return values or conditions are not detailed in the provided output cases, we can only state the parameters.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` (number of districts), an integer `k` (number of contestants to be removed), and a list of tuples `edges` (representing roads between districts). The function then performs some operation based on these inputs, but the exact nature of the operation and the return value are not specified here.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list of tuples `edges`.**
