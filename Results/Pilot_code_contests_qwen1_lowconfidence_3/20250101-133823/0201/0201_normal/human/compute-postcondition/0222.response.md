`new_nodes` is appended with the value `p`, which means `new_nodes` now contains `[p, p]`. The value of `count`, `index`, `abort`, and `flag` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_nodes` is `[p, p]`, `count` must be greater than 0, `index` must be less than or equal to 0, `abort` must be either `True` or `False`, and `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`.
Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p, p]`, `count` must be greater than 0, `index` must be less than or equal to 0, `abort` must be either `True` or `False`, and `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`**
