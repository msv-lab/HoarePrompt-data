`nodes[p + 1]` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `new_nodes` remains unchanged since no operations are performed on it within the given code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_nodes` must contain at least one value; `nodes[p + 1]` is 1.

Output State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one value; `nodes[p + 1]` is 1**
