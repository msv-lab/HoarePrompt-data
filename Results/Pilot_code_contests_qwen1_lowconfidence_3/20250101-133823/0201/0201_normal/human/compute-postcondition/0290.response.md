Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is `[p]`, `index` is `nodes[p]`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on the condition `flag == -1`, `flag` is set to `-1`, `count` retains its value, `i` retains its value, and `index` is less than or equal to 0. Since there is no else part, these conditions hold regardless of the if condition's outcome.***
