The code `stack_append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the stack. From the initial state, we know that `v` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`. Therefore, appending `v` to the stack means adding `storage[t + 1]` to the stack.

Let's summarize the changes:
- The stack now contains `storage[t + 1]` in addition to its previous contents.
- The value of `nodes` and `t` remain unchanged.
- The value of `v` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes` has an element at index `v * 2` set to `index`; `v` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`; the stack contains `storage[t + 1]` appended to it; `t` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`.**
