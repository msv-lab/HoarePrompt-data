`n` and `k` are assigned the values read from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`. This function reads a line of input and splits it into multiple parts (integers in this case), converting them to integers. The previous values of `n` and `k` are overwritten with these new values.

Since the code does not affect the `edges` list, it remains unchanged. The updated values of `n` and `k` are obtained from the input, but their specific values are not provided here. However, we know that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^6.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^6; `edges` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers a and b representing a road connecting districts a and b.**
