Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is `n * 2`, `abort` is `False`, `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`, and if `flag` equals 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `flag` does not equal 1, the conditions remain as specified in the precondition.***
