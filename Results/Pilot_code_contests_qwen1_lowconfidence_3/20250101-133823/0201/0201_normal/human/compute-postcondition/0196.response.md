Initial State: `new_nodes` is either an empty list with all elements in `nodes[p+1]` equal to `1` when `count == 0`, or `new_nodes` is a list containing elements `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, ..., nodes[index] * 2]` until the condition `flag == -1` or `index <= 0` is met. For every `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`. `count` is adjusted by subtracting the length of `new_nodes`, and `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1` for all `j` in the range of `-c` to `0`, and `i` is undefined.

Given code snippet:
```python
new_nodes = []
```

This line of code initializes `new_nodes` as an empty list. Given that `new_nodes` was previously either in a certain state or defined by conditions, this assignment overwrites any previous state or definition of `new_nodes` to an empty list.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `count` is adjusted by subtracting the length of `new_nodes`, and `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1` for all `j` in the range of `-c` to `0`.**
