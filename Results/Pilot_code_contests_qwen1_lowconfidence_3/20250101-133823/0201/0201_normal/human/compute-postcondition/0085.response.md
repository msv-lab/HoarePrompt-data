Postcondition: ***`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `stack` contains `v` (which is `storage[t + 1]`) and possibly other elements, `index` is unchanged, `parent_index` is unchanged, `t` is now `storage[t]`, `v` is now `storage[t + 1]`, and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0. Since the if condition `v == parent_index` is checked, if this condition is true, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. There is no else part, so the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition outcome.***
