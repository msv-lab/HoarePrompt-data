Let's analyze the given state and the `while True` loop step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `new_nodes` is an empty list.
   - `index` is 0 or less.
   - `abort` is `False`.
   - `flag` is `nodes[new_nodes[-1] + 1]` if the loop did not break due to `index <= 0`.
   - `c` is -1.
   - `count` is -1.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `p` is `(n - 1) * 2`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop is a `while True` loop, meaning it will always execute at least once unless explicitly broken out of.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - Since it's a `while True` loop, no specific condition is checked within the loop itself to determine whether it should continue executing. Therefore, the state does not need any adjustments for the loop to execute at least one more time.

Given this analysis, no state needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time because the loop will always run regardless of the current state values.

**Answer**:
State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `index` is 0 or less, `abort` is `False`, `flag` is `nodes[new_nodes[-1] + 1]` if the loop did not break due to `index <= 0`, `c` is -1, `count` is -1, `i` is `n - 1`, `p` is `(n - 1) * 2`**
