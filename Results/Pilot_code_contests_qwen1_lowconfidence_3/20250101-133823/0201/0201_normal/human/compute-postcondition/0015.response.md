The code `lookup[u] = storage_index` updates the value of `lookup[u]` to be the current value of `storage_index`. From the initial state, `storage_index` is the value of `storage[0]`, which is `lookup[u_new]`.

After executing the code, the following changes occur:
- `lookup[u]` is updated to `lookup[u_new]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`storage[0]` is `lookup[u_new]`, `storage[1]` is `v_new`, `storage[2]` is -1, `storage[3]` is 1 or -1 depending on whether `v_new == u_new`, `storage[4]` is `u_new`, `storage[9]` is 1 or 3, `storage[10]` is `v_new`, `lookup[u]` is `lookup[u_new]`**
