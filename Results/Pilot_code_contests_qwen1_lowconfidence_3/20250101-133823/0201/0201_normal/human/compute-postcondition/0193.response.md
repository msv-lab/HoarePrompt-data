Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `n`; `new_nodes` is a list containing elements `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, ..., nodes[index] * 2]` until the condition `flag == -1` or `index <= 0` is met; `p` is the final value of `index * 2`; `abort` is `True`; `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`; `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`; for every `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`; `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)` and `c` must be less than 0; `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1` for all `j` in the range of `-c` to `0`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over a range of `-c` where `c` is defined as `count - len(new_nodes)`. This means the loop will continue to run until `c` becomes non-negative.
- During each iteration of the loop, the element at index `new_nodes[j] + 1` in the `nodes` list is set to `-1`.
- Since the loop continues until `c` (which is initially less than 0) becomes non-negative, it implies that the loop will continue to decrement `c` until it reaches 0. This means the loop will execute `len(new_nodes)` times.
- After the loop completes, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` will be `-1` for all `j` in the range `-c` to `0`.

Given that the loop executes `len(new_nodes)` times, the values of the variables after the loop finishes executing will remain as described above.
