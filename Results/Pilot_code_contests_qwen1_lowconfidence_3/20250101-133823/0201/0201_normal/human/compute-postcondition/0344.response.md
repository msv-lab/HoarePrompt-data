The code `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` updates the value of `nodes` at the index `new_nodes[j] + 1` to `-1`. This affects the `nodes` list, but since no specific value of `j` is given, the exact updated value of `nodes` cannot be determined without knowing the value of `new_nodes[j]`.

The initial state is:
- `new_nodes` is a list,
- `index` is the last value of `index` before the loop breaks,
- `abort` is `True`,
- `flag` is the value of `nodes[index * 2 + k]` where `k` is such that the loop breaks due to `flag == -1` or `flag == 1`,
- `count` is `-1`,
- `i` is `n - 1`,
- `c` is adjusted so that `-c` is less than or equal to `len(new_nodes)`,
- and `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1`.

After executing the code, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is updated to `-1`. Since `j` is not specified, the exact position in the `nodes` list remains unknown, but the value at that position is now `-1`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is a list, `index` is the last value of `index` before the loop breaks, `abort` is `True`, `flag` is the value of `nodes[index * 2 + k]` where `k` is such that the loop breaks due to `flag == -1` or `flag == 1`, `count` is `-1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `c` is adjusted so that `-c` is less than or equal to `len(new_nodes)`, and `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1`.**
