Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `new_nodes` list.
   - For each element `p` in `new_nodes`, the loop body is executed.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `new_nodes`.

3. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `new_nodes` is a list containing elements `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, ..., nodes[index] * 2 ...]` where each element in the list is the result of the operation `nodes[index] * 2` starting from `n * 2` and continuing until the condition `flag == -1` or `index <= 0` is met.
   - `p` is the final value of `index * 2`.
   - `abort` is `True`.
   - `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`.
   - `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`.

4. **Determining Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `new_nodes` must contain at least one element. If `new_nodes` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - We need to ensure that `new_nodes` contains at least one element.

5. **Ensuring `new_nodes` is Non-Empty**:
   - To form the `new_nodes` list, we need to ensure that the initial conditions leading to its creation meet the criteria for generating at least one element.
   - Specifically, the initial value of `index` (which is `nodes[p]`) and the value of `flag` (which is `nodes[p] + 1`) must allow for the generation of at least one element in `new_nodes`.

6. **Final State Before Loop Starts**:
   - Ensure `new_nodes` is non-empty.
   - Ensure the loop variable `p` (the final value of `index * 2`) is valid and leads to a non-empty `new_nodes` list.

### Final Adjusted States

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing at least one element, `p` is the final value of `index * 2`, `abort` is `True`, `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`, and `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`**.

This ensures that `new_nodes` is non-empty and the loop can proceed.
