The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. Since no such loop or conditional statement is present in the given code, the variables remain unchanged after the `break` statement is executed.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `index` is 0 or less, `abort` is `True`, `flag` is -1, `c` is -1, `count` is -1, `i` is `n - 1`, `p` is `(n - 1) * 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
