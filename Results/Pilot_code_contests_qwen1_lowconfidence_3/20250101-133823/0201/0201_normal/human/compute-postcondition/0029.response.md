The code `storage_index += 2` increments the value of `storage_index` by 2. Given the initial state, the value of `storage_index` was increased by 2 before this line of code. Therefore, after executing `storage_index += 2`, `storage_index` will be increased by another 2.

The output state is: `storage[0] = lookup[u_new]`, `storage[1] = v_new`, `storage[2] = -1`, `storage[3] = 1` or `-1`, `storage[4] = u_new`, `storage[9] = 1` or `3`, `storage[10] = v_new`, `storage[storage_index] = storage_index`, `storage[storage_index + 1] = u`, `storage[storage_index + 2] = lookup[v]`, `lookup[v] = storage_index`, `storage_index` is increased by 4 (from its original value).

Output State: **`storage[0] = lookup[u_new]`, `storage[1] = v_new`, `storage[2] = -1`, `storage[3] = 1` or `-1`, `storage[4] = u_new`, `storage[9] = 1` or `3`, `storage[10] = v_new`, `storage[storage_index] = storage_index + 4`, `storage[storage_index + 1] = u`, `storage[storage_index + 2] = lookup[v]`, `lookup[v] = storage_index`, `storage_index` is increased by 4**
