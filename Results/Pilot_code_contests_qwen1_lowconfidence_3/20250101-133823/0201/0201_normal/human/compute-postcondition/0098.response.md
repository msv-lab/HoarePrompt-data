Postcondition: ***`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `stack` is missing the last element (previously `v`), `index` is the value popped from the stack, `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]` which equals `v`, `t` is `storage[lookup[index]]`, `v` is `storage[lookup[index] + 1]`. If `v` equals `parent_index`, the conditions remain as described. There is no else part provided, so the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition's outcome.***
