`t` is assigned the value of `lookup[index]`. The value of `index` is popped from the `stack`, and `parent_index` is the value of `nodes[index * 2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nodes` and the `stack` must not be empty; `index` is the value popped from the `stack`; `parent_index` is the value of `nodes[index * 2]`; `t` is the value of `lookup[index]`.

Output State: **`nodes` and the `stack` must not be empty; `index` is the value popped from the `stack`; `parent_index` is the value of `nodes[index * 2]`; `t` is the value of `lookup[index]`**
