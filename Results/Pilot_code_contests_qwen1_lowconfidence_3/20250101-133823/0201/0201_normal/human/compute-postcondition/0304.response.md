Let's analyze the given state and the `while True` loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `new_nodes` is `[p, p]`
- `index` is `index`
- `abort` is either `True` or `False` based on `flag == -1`
- `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`
- `count` retains its value
- `i` retains its value
- `p` is `index * 2`
- We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Analysis of the `while True` Loop:
- The loop runs indefinitely (`while True`) unless explicitly broken out of, such as by a `break` statement inside the loop.

### Determining the Next State:
Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute again unless there is an explicit `break` within the loop. Given that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring that the loop can continue executing without breaking out.

### Required Adjustment:
- No specific state adjustment is necessary because the `while True` loop will always execute again unless explicitly broken out of. Since we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement, the loop condition itself remains true, and the loop will continue.

### Final Answer:
State: **`new_nodes` is `[p, p]`, `index` is `index`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` based on `flag == -1`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`, `count` retains its value, `i` retains its value, `p` is `index * 2`**
