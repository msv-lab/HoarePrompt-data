`abort` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_nodes` is [p], `count` must be greater than 0, `index` must be less than or equal to 0, `abort` is `True`, and `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is [p], `count` must be greater than 0, `index` must be less than or equal to 0, `abort` is `True`, and `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`**
