The code snippet updates `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` to `-1`. According to the initial state, `new_nodes` is a list of indices where `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1` for every `p` in `new_nodes`, and `j` is `-c - 1`. Given that `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)` and `c` must be less than 0, `j` must be the last index of `new_nodes`.

Since `nodes[p + 1]` is already `-1` for every `p` in `new_nodes`, updating `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` to `-1` does not change the existing state because the value is already `-1`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing elements `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, ..., nodes[index] * 2]` until the condition `flag == -1` or `index <= 0` is met, `p` is the final value of `index * 2`, `abort` is `True`, `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`, `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`, for every `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`, `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)` and `c` must be less than 0, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1, `j` is `-c - 1`**.
