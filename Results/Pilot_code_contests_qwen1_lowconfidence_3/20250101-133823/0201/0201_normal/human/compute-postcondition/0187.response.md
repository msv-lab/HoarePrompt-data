Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `for j in xrange(-c):`. In Python, `xrange` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to the specified end point (exclusive). However, since the start point is negative (`-c`), this is invalid because `xrange` does not support negative start points.

2. **Analyze the Pre-loop States:**
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `new_nodes` is a list containing elements \([n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, ..., nodes[index] * 2]\) until the condition `flag == -1` or `index \leq 0` is met.
   - `p` is the final value of `index * 2`.
   - `abort` is `True`.
   - `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`.
   - `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`.
   - For every `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`.
   - `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`.
   - `c` is less than 0.

3. **Determine Validity of the Loop:**
   Since `c` is less than 0, `-c` would result in a positive number. Therefore, `xrange(-c)` would generate a valid range of numbers, starting from 0 up to `-c - 1`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `c` must be less than 0.
   - There are no other conditions or states that directly affect the validity of the loop execution based on the given information.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

**State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing elements \([n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, ..., nodes[index] * 2]\) until the condition `flag == -1` or `index \leq 0` is met, `p` is the final value of `index * 2`, `abort` is `True`, `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`, `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`, for every `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`, `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`, and `c` must be less than 0.**
