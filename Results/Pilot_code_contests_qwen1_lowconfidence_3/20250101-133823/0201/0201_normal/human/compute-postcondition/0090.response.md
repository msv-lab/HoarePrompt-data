`index` is assigned the value returned by `stack_pop()`, which means `index` will now hold the value that was popped from the stack. The value of `v` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. `stack` loses the element that was popped, but the other elements remain. `parent_index`, `t`, and `v` are unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `stack` is missing the last element (previously `v`), `index` is the value popped from the stack, `parent_index` is unchanged, `t` is -1 or less, `v` is the final value after the last iteration of the loop**
