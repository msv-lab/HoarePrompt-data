To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's go through the provided information step by step:

1. **`new_nodes` is a list containing the values of `p` until the loop condition is no longer satisfied**: This means `new_nodes` must contain at least one value for the loop to execute. If `new_nodes` is empty, the loop will not execute.

2. **For each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`**: This detail is not directly relevant to the loop execution but will affect the loop body. We don't need to adjust this as part of ensuring the loop can execute.

3. **`index` is `0` or less**: The initial value of `index` being `0` or less doesn't prevent the loop from executing based on the given context. It might influence the loop body, but not the loop condition itself.

4. **`abort` is `True` if `flag` was `-1` at any point during the loop, otherwise `False` if `flag` was `1` at any point**: This describes the final state of `abort` after the loop. However, it doesn't affect whether the loop can start.

5. **`flag` is `nodes[p + 1]` if the loop did not break due to `index <= 0`**: This describes the value of `flag` after the loop but not before the loop. It doesn't affect the loop's execution condition.

6. **`c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`**: This is a calculation for `c` based on `count` and `len(new_nodes)`, but it doesn't affect the loop's execution condition.

7. **`c` is greater than or equal to 0**: This ensures `c` is non-negative, but it doesn't affect the loop's execution condition.

Given these points, the critical factor for the loop to execute is the presence of elements in `new_nodes`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**`new_nodes` must contain at least one value.**

So, the final answer is:

State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one value**
