The code `nodes[v * 2] = index` updates the value of `nodes[v * 2]` to be `index`. This affects only the `nodes` list at the index `v * 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `stack` is missing the last element (previously `v`), `index` is the value popped from the stack, `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]` which equals `v`, `t` is `storage[lookup[index]]`, `v` is `storage[lookup[index] + 1]`**
