Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is a list containing the values of `p` until the loop condition is no longer satisfied; for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1` or `1`; `index` is `0` or less; `abort` is `True` if `flag` was `-1` at any point during the loop, otherwise `False` if `flag` was `1` at any point; `flag` is `nodes[new_nodes[-1] + 1]` if the loop did not break due to `index <= 0` and `c` is `-c - 1` which is less than `0`; if `c` is already less than `0`, `new_nodes` is an empty list and for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `1` and `count` is equal to `c` which is `0`.***
