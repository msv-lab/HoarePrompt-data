The code `nodes[p + 1] = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the index `p + 1` in the list `nodes`. The previous value of `p` and other variables remain unchanged, but now `nodes[p + 1]` is specifically `-1`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` must not be an empty list, `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop breaks, `index` is the last value of `index` before the loop breaks, `abort` is `True`, `flag` is the value of `nodes[index * 2 + k]` where `k` is such that the loop breaks due to `flag == -1` or `flag == 1`, `count` is -1, `i` is `n - 1`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1.**
