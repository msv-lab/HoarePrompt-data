The code `lookup[u] = storage_index` assigns the value of `storage_index` to `lookup[u]`. Given the initial state, `storage_index` is 1, so `lookup[u]` will be set to 1. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage` is a list of length 4 * n with `storage[0]` being `lookup[u]` and `storage[1]` being `v`, and all other elements are -1; `storage_index` is 1; `n` is an integer representing the number of districts (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6); `k` is an integer representing the number of contestants to be removed (1 ≤ k < n); `edges` is a list of tuples representing roads; `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with `lookup[u]` being 1 and all other elements being -1.**
