The code assigns the value of `nodes[index * 2]` to the variable `parent_index`. Given that `nodes[v * 2]` was originally `index`, the new value of `parent_index` will be `nodes[index * 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `stack` is missing the last element (previously `v`), `index` is the value popped from the stack, `parent_index` is now `nodes[index * 2]`, `t` is -1 or less, `v` is the final value after the last iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `stack` is missing the last element (previously `v`), `index` is the value popped from the stack, `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]`, `t` is -1 or less, `v` is the final value after the last iteration of the loop**
