The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most inner if statement. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement active at the time of the `break` statement, it simply indicates that we are breaking out of the most inner active structure (which would typically be a loop or an if statement). The values of the variables do not change as a result of the `break` statement.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is `n * 2`, `abort` is `False`, `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
