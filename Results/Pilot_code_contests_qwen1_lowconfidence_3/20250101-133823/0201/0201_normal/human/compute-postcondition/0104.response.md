The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables `v`, `t`, or `storage`. The initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is the value at index `t + 1` in the `storage` list; `storage` is a list; `t` is now the value at index `t` in `storage`**
