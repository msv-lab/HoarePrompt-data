`nodes[p + 1]` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `new_nodes` is not affected by this operation since it is not referenced in the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_nodes` must contain at least one element; `nodes[p + 1]` is equal to `1`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one element; `nodes[p + 1]` is equal to `1`**
