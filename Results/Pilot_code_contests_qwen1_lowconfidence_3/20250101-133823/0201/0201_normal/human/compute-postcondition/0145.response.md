The code snippet `new_nodes.append(p)` appends the value of `p` to the list `new_nodes`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2]`.
- `p` is `index * 2`.
- `abort` is `False` if `flag` is not -1, and `True` if `flag` equals -1.
- `index` is equal to `nodes[n * 2]`.
- If `flag` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

Since `p` is defined as `index * 2` and `index` is `nodes[n * 2]`, we substitute these into the expression for `p`:
\[ p = \text{nodes}[n * 2] * 2 \]

After appending `p` to `new_nodes`, the new state of `new_nodes` will include both its original value and the newly appended value:
\[ \text{new\_nodes} = [n * 2, \text{nodes}[n * 2] * 2] \]

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2]`, `p` is `index * 2`, `abort` remains `False` if `flag` is not -1, and `abort` is `True` if `flag` equals -1, and `index` is equal to `nodes[n * 2]`.**
