Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2]`, `p` is `nodes[n * 2] * 2`, `abort` remains `False` if `flag` is not -1, and `abort` is `True` if `flag` equals -1, and `index` is equal to `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2]`. If `index` is less than or equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
