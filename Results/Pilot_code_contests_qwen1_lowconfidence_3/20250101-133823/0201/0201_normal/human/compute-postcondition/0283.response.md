The code `break` is used to exit the current loop or the most nested loop or structure in which it appears. Since there is no loop or structure (like a function call or conditional statement) present in the given code snippet, the variables `new_nodes`, `index`, `abort`, `flag`, `c`, `count`, `i`, and `p` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `index` is 0 or less, `abort` is `False`, `flag` is 1, `c` is -1, `count` is -1, `i` is `n - 1`, `p` is `(n - 1) * 2`**
