Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `new_nodes` is a list containing at least one element.
   - `p` is the final value of `index * 2`.
   - `abort` is `True`.
   - `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`.
   - `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`.
   - `nodes[p + 1]` is -1.

2. **Loop Control Variables:**
   - The loop variable `p` is taken from the `new_nodes` list.
   - For the loop to continue, there must be at least one element left in `new_nodes`.

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `i` is already equal to `n`, it won't change within the loop unless there is a specific condition inside the loop body that modifies it, but we don't have that information.
   - `abort` being `True` indicates that the loop might have encountered an abort condition and could potentially terminate. However, if the loop continues, `abort` should remain `True`.
   - `index` and `flag` depend on the value of `nodes[p]`, which changes with each iteration. Since `p` is derived from `index * 2` and then incremented, we need to consider the updated value of `index` and `flag` for the next iteration.
   - `nodes[p + 1]` needs to be checked to ensure it remains `-1` for the next iteration.

Given the above points, the key adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are:
- Ensure `new_nodes` still contains at least one element.
- Update `p` based on the current `index`.
- Ensure `index` and `flag` are correctly updated according to the loop body (though we don't have the exact details).

Here is the state after adjusting for the next iteration:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing at least one element, `p` is the updated value of `index * 2`, `abort` is `True`, `index` is the updated value of `nodes[p]`, `flag` is the updated value of `nodes[p] + 1`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1**
