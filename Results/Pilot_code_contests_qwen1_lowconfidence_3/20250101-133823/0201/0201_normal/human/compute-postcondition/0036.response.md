The `index` variable is assigned the value returned by the `pop` method of `stack`. Since `stack` initially contains only one element `'n'`, calling `stack_pop()` will remove `'n'` from the stack and assign it to `index`. The length of the list `nodes` and the contents of `stack` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with all elements equal to 0; `stack` is an empty list; `index` is 'n'; `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`; `stack_append` references the `append` method of `stack`.**
