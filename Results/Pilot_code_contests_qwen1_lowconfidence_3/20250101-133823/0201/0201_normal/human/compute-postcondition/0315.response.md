The code `p = index * 2` updates the value of `p` to `index * 2`. Given the initial state, `p` was previously `index * 2`, which means the value of `p` does not change because it is already set to `index * 2`. All other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_nodes` is `[p, p, p]`, `index` is `index` if `flag == -1` else `nodes[index * 2]`, `abort` is `True` if `flag == -1` else `False`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 2]`, `count` retains its value, `i` retains its value, `p` is `index * 2`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[index * 2, index * 2, index * 2]`, `index` is `index` if `flag == -1` else `nodes[index * 2]`, `abort` is `True` if `flag == -1` else `False`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 2]`, `count` retains its value, `i` retains its value, `p` is `index * 2`**
