The code `flag = nodes[p + 1]` assigns the value of `nodes[p + 1]` to `flag`. Here, `p` is defined as `index * 2`. Let's follow through the steps:

1. Initially, `new_nodes` is `[p]`, `index` is `nodes[p]`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` based on `flag == -1`, `flag` is set to `-1`, `count` retains its value, `i` retains its value, and `p` is `index * 2`.
2. The line `flag = nodes[p + 1]` updates the value of `flag` to `nodes[p + 1]`.

Since `p` is `index * 2`, `p + 1` would be `index * 2 + 1`. However, the exact value of `nodes[p + 1]` is not specified in the initial state, so we keep it as `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`.

The other variables (`new_nodes`, `index`, `abort`, `count`, `i`, and `p`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `new_nodes` is `[p]`
- `index` is `nodes[p]`
- `abort` is either `True` or `False` based on `flag == -1`
- `flag` is now `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`
- `count` retains its value
- `i` retains its value
- `p` is `index * 2`

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p]`, `index` is `nodes[p]`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` based on `flag == -1`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`, `count` retains its value, `i` retains its value, `p` is `index * 2`**
