`parent_index` is assigned the value of `nodes[index * 2]`. Given the initial state, `index` is 'n', and `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with all elements equal to 0. Therefore, `parent_index` will be `nodes[n * 2]`, which is 0 because all elements in `nodes` are initialized to 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with all elements equal to 0; `stack` is an empty list; `index` is 'n'; `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`; `stack_append` references the `append` method of `stack`; `parent_index` is 0.

Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with all elements equal to 0; `stack` is an empty list; `index` is 'n'; `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`; `stack_append` references the `append` method of `stack`; `parent_index` is 0.**
