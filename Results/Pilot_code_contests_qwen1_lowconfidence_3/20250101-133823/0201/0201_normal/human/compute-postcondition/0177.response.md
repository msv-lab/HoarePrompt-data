According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `new_nodes`. For the loop to execute again, `new_nodes` must contain at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `new_nodes` must contain at least one element, and `nodes[p + 1]` is equal to `1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `p` needs to be set to the first element in `new_nodes`, and `nodes[p + 1]` must still be equal to `1`.

State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one element, `nodes[p + 1]` is equal to `1` where `p` is the first element in `new_nodes`**
