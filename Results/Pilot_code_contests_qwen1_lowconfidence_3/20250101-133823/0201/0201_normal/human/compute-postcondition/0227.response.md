According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute as long as the loop body does not contain any `break` statements that terminate the loop prematurely. Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `new_nodes` is `[p, p]`
- `count` must be greater than 0
- `index` is `p`
- `abort` must be either `True` or `False`
- `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`

Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again unless explicitly terminated. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the states to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`new_nodes` is `[p, p]`, `count` must be greater than 0, `index` is `p`, `abort` must be either `True` or `False`, and `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`**
