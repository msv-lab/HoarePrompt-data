`t` is assigned the value of `lookup[index]`. The value of `index` is 'n', so `t` becomes `lookup[n]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with all elements equal to 0; `stack` is an empty list; `index` is 'n'; `t` is `lookup[n]`; `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`; `stack_append` references the `append` method of `stack`; `parent_index` is 0.**
