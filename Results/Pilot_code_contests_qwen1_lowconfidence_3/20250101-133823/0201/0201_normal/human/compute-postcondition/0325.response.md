The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the state of the program. All the variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`new_nodes` must not be an empty list, `index` is the last value of `index` before the loop breaks, `abort` is `True`, `flag` is the value of `nodes[index * 2 + k]` where `k` is such that the loop breaks due to `flag == -1` or `flag == 1`, `count` is -1, `i` is `n - 1`. For each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1.**
