The code `nodes[p + 1] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the element in the list `nodes` at index `p + 1`. The initial state tells us that `new_nodes` must contain at least two elements and `nodes[p + 1]` is defined and valid. After executing the code, the value of `nodes[p + 1]` changes to `1`, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least two elements, `nodes[p + 1]` is 1**
