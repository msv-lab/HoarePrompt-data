Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is an empty list, `index` is 0 or less, `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on the condition `flag == -1`. If `flag == -1`, `abort` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `abort` remains `False`. `flag` is set to -1 if the condition is true, otherwise it is set to 1. All other variables (`c`, `count`, `i`, `p`) retain their values as specified in the precondition.***
