The code `stack_pop = stack.pop` assigns the method `pop` of the `stack` list to the variable `stack_pop`. This does not change the contents of the `stack` list or the value of `nodes`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length 2 * (n + 1) with all elements equal to 0; `stack` is ['n']; `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`**
