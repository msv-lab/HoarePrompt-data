Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2]`, `p` is `index * 2`, `abort` remains `False`, and `index` is equal to `nodes[n * 2]`. If `flag` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `flag` is not 1, no change occurs in the listed variables.***
