The code `stack_append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the `stack`. Based on the initial state, `v` is now `storage[t + 1]`. Therefore, the `stack` will have its current elements plus the value of `storage[t + 1]`.

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `stack` contains `v` (which is `storage[t + 1]`) and possibly other elements, `index` is unchanged, `parent_index` is unchanged, `t` is now `storage[t]`, `v` is now `storage[t + 1]`, and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.**
