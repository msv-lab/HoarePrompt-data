The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the current loop or the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, it would exit whatever loop or if statement `index * 2` was inside of, but since no loop or if statement is mentioned in the code snippet itself, we assume it exits the most internal one.

Given the initial state:
- `new_nodes` is `[p]`
- `index` is `nodes[p]`
- `abort` is `True`
- `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`
- `count` retains its value
- `i` retains its value
- `p` is `index * 2`

After the `break` statement, none of these values change. The `abort` remains `True`, and the other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p]`, `index` is `nodes[p]`, `abort` is `True`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`, `count` retains its value, `i` retains its value, `p` is `index * 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
