The code `nodes[p + 1] = -1` does not change the value of `nodes[p + 1]` since it is already `-1`. However, this line confirms the value of `nodes[p + 1]` remains `-1`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing at least one element, `p` is the final value of `index * 2`, `abort` is `True`, `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`, `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1**
