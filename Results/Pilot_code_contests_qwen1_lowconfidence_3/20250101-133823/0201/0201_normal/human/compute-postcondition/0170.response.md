Let's analyze the loop and the provided output states step-by-step to determine the final output state after the loop executes.

### Initial State
- \( n \geq 1 \)
- \( i = n \)
- \( new\_nodes \) is a list containing elements \([n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, ..., nodes[index] * 2]\) until the condition \( flag == -1 \) or \( index \leq 0 \) is met.
- \( p \) is the final value of \( index * 2 \)
- \( abort \) is `True`
- \( index \) is the last value assigned to \( index \), which is \( nodes[p] \)
- \( flag \) is the value of \( nodes[p] + 1 \)

### Loop Code
```python
for p in new_nodes:
    nodes[p + 1] = -1
```

### Analysis of the Loop
1. **First Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `new_nodes`.
   - For each \( p \) in `new_nodes`, \( nodes[p + 1] \) is set to `-1`.

2. **Subsequent Iterations:**
   - The loop continues to iterate over the remaining elements in `new_nodes`.
   - Each time an element \( p \) is processed, \( nodes[p + 1] \) is set to `-1`.

### Output State After Some Number of Times
From the provided output states, we observe that:
- The loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in `new_nodes`.
- Each element \( p \) in `new_nodes` sets \( nodes[p + 1] \) to `-1`.

### Final State After All Iterations
- Since the loop continues until there are no more elements in `new_nodes`, all elements \( p + 1 \) in `nodes` will be set to `-1` if they exist within the bounds of the array.
- The variables \( n \), \( i \), \( abort \), \( index \), and \( flag \) do not change during the loop because the loop only modifies the `nodes` array.

### Final Output State
- \( n \geq 1 \)
- \( i = n \)
- \( new\_nodes \) is a list containing elements \([n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, ..., nodes[index] * 2]\) until the condition \( flag == -1 \) or \( index \leq 0 \) is met.
- \( p \) is the final value of \( index * 2 \)
- \( abort \) is `True`
- \( index \) is the last value assigned to \( index \), which is \( nodes[p] \)
- \( flag \) is the value of \( nodes[p] + 1 \)
- For every \( p \) in `new_nodes`, \( nodes[p + 1] \) is `-1`.

### Conclusion
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing elements \([n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, ..., nodes[index] * 2]\) until the condition `flag == -1` or `index \leq 0` is met, `p` is the final value of `index * 2`, `abort` is `True`, `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`, `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`, and for every `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`.**
