Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is `[p]`, `index` is `nodes[p]`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` based on `flag == -1`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`, `count` retains its value, `i` retains its value, `p` is `index * 2`. If `flag == -1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `flag == 1`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
