Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Initial State:
- `new_nodes` is an empty list.
- `index` is 0 or less.
- `abort` is `False`.
- `flag` is `nodes[new_nodes[-1] + 1]` if the loop did not break due to `index <= 0`, otherwise it is undefined since `new_nodes` is initially empty.
- `c` is -1.
- `count` is -1.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `p` is `(n - 1) * 2`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop continues indefinitely until one of the following conditions is met:
1. `flag == -1`: In this case, `abort` is set to `True` and the loop breaks.
2. `flag == 1`: In this case, the loop also breaks.

Each iteration of the loop performs the following steps:
- Updates `flag` to `nodes[p + 1]`.
- If `flag == -1`, sets `abort` to `True` and breaks.
- If `flag == 1`, breaks.
- Otherwise, appends `p` to `new_nodes`.
- Updates `index` to `nodes[p]`.
- If `index <= 0`, breaks.
- Updates `p` to `index * 2`.

### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **First Iteration**:
   - `new_nodes` becomes `[p]`.
   - `index` is `nodes[p]`.
   - `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on `flag == -1`.
   - `flag` is updated to `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`.
   - `count` and `i` retain their values.
   - `p` is updated to `index * 2`.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `new_nodes` becomes `[p, p]`.
   - `index` is the same as the previous `index`.
   - `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on `flag == -1`.
   - `flag` is updated to `nodes[index * 2 + 2]`.
   - `count` and `i` retain their values.
   - `p` is updated to `index * 2`.

3. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - This pattern continues until either `flag == -1` or `flag == 1`, in which case the loop breaks.

### Final State:
- After the loop has executed, `new_nodes` contains a list of values obtained through the series of updates to `p`.
- `index` is the last value of `index` before the loop breaks.
- `abort` is `True` if `flag == -1` at the point of breaking, otherwise it is `False`.
- `flag` is the value of `nodes[index * 2 + k]` where `k` is such that the loop breaks due to `flag == -1` or `flag == 1`.
- `count` and `i` retain their original values.
- `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop breaks, which is `index * 2`.

### Output State:
```plaintext
Output State: **new_nodes` is a list containing the values of `p` obtained during each iteration until the loop breaks, `index` is the last value of `index` before the loop breaks, `abort` is `True` if `flag == -1` at the point of breaking, otherwise it is `False`, `flag` is the value of `nodes[index * 2 + k]` where `k` is such that the loop breaks due to `flag == -1` or `flag == 1`, `count` is -1, `i` is `n - 1`, and `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop breaks.**
