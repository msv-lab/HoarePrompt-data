The variable `abort` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `count` is adjusted by subtracting the length of `new_nodes`, and `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1` for all `j` in the range of `-c` to `0`; `p` is `i * 2`; `abort` is `False`.**
