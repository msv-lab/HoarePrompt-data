The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. In this case, it would break out of the loop or conditional block we were in, but the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p]`, `index` is `nodes[p]`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` based on `flag == -1`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`, `count` retains its value, `i` retains its value, `p` is `index * 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
