The code updates the value of `p` to `index * 2`. Given that `index` is initially equal to `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2]`, the new value of `p` will be `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2] * 2`.

All other variables remain unchanged: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2]`, `abort` remains `False` if `flag` is not -1 and `True` if `flag` equals -1, and `index` remains equal to `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2]`, `p` is `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2] * 2`, `abort` remains `False` if `flag` is not -1 and `True` if `flag` equals -1, and `index` is equal to `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2]`.**
