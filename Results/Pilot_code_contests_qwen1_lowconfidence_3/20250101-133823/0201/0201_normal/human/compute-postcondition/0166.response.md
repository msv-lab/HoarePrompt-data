According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p` which is an element from the `new_nodes` list. For the loop to execute again, `p` must be a valid index in `new_nodes`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we have the following states:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is equal to `n`
- `new_nodes` is a list containing at least one element
- `p` is the final value of `index * 2`
- `abort` is `True`
- `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`
- `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`
- `nodes[p + 1]` is -1

For the loop to execute one more time, `p` must be a valid index in `new_nodes` and the loop condition should still hold true. Given that `p` is the result of `index * 2` and considering that `new_nodes` contains at least one element, the next value of `p` should be the next valid index in the list.

Since `p` was derived from `index * 2`, and assuming `index` was the last value used, the next valid `p` would be derived from the next valid `index` which could be `nodes[p] + 1` (considering the structure and the previous values).

However, since `abort` is `True` and no further actions can be taken if `abort` is set, the loop will not execute again under these conditions.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing at least one element, `p` is the final value of `index * 2`, `abort` is `True`, `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`, `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1**
