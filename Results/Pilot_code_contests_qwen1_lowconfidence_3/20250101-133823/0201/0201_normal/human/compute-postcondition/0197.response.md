The code `p = i * 2` assigns the value of `i * 2` to the variable `p`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, and no value is provided for `i`. Therefore, the value of `p` is `i * 2`, where `i` retains its undefined status.

The other variables (`new_nodes`, `count`, and `nodes`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `count` is adjusted by subtracting the length of `new_nodes`, and `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1` for all `j` in the range of `-c` to `0`; `p` is `i * 2`**
