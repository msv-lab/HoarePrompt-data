The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. No changes are made to the values of the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `stack` is missing the last element (previously `v`), `index` is the value popped from the stack, `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]` which equals `v`, `t` is `storage[lookup[index]]`, `v` is `storage[lookup[index] + 1`]**
