The code `stack_append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `stack`. Given the initial state, `v` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`. The initial state also mentions that `stack` is an empty list. After executing this line of code, `stack` will contain the value of `v`.

Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with the element at index `storage[t + 1] * 2` set to `n`, and all other elements are 0; `stack` contains `storage[t + 1]`; `index` is `n`; `t` is `storage[t + 1]`; `v` is `storage[t + 1]`; `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`; `stack_append` references the `append` method of `stack`; `parent_index` is 0.**
