`index` is assigned the value popped from the `stack`. Since the `stack` is not empty, `index` now holds the value that was last in the stack. The `stack` will have one less element after the pop operation.

Output State: **`nodes` and the `stack` must not be empty; `index` is the value popped from the `stack`.**
