`i` is multiplied by 2, resulting in the value being assigned to `p`. The initial value of `i` is `n`, so `p` is now `n * 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is `n * 2`**
