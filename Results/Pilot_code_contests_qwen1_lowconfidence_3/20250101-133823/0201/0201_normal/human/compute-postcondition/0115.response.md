Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `stack` contains the elements added during the loop, `index` is the value originally popped from the stack, `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]` and is equal to `v`, `t` is `storage[lookup[index]]` and does not change further within the loop, `v` is `storage[lookup[index] + 1]` and does not change further within the loop, `v` is the final value after the last iteration of the loop.**
