The code `lookup[v] = storage_index` updates the `lookup` list at index `v` to the current value of `storage_index`, which is 3. This means that `lookup[v]` is now set to 3.

All other elements in the list `storage`, the value of `storage_index`, `n`, `k`, and `edges` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`storage` is a list of length 4 * n with `storage[0]` being `lookup[u]`, `storage[1]` being `v`, `storage[2]` being -1, `storage[3]` being either 1 or -1 depending on whether `v == u`, and `storage[4]` being `u`; `storage_index` is 3; `n` is an integer representing the number of districts (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6); `k` is an integer representing the number of contestants to be removed (1 ≤ k < n); `edges` is a list of tuples representing roads; `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with `lookup[u]` being 1, `lookup[v]` being 3, and all other elements being -1.**
