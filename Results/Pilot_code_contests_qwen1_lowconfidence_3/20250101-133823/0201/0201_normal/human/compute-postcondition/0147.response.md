The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block directly containing the `break` statement, the effect of the `break` statement is to simply exit the context it was placed in. Given the initial state and the presence of the `break` statement, the following variables are affected:

- `abort` remains unchanged unless explicitly set to `True` by another condition, which is not indicated here.
- `index` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2]`, `p` is `nodes[n * 2] * 2`, `abort` remains `False` if `flag` is not -1, and `abort` is `True` if `flag` equals -1, and `index` is equal to `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
