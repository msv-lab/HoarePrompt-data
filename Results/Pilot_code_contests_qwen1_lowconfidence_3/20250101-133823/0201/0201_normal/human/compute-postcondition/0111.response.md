The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, since no loop is specified, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables outside of a loop context. The variables `nodes`, `v`, `storage`, and `t` remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`nodes` has an element at index `v * 2` set to `index`; `v` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`; the stack contains the value `storage[t + 1]` appended to it; `t` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`**
