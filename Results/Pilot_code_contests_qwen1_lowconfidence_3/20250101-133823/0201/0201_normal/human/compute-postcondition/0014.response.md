The code `storage[storage_index + 1] = v` means that the value of `v` is assigned to `storage[storage_index + 1]`. Given the initial state, `storage_index` is 9, so `storage[9 + 1]` which is `storage[10]` will be assigned the value of `v`.

From the initial state, `storage[1]` is `v_new`, and `v` is used in the assignment, so let's assume `v` is `v_new` for this calculation.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step breakdown:
- `storage[10]` will be set to `v_new`.
- The other variables remain unchanged.

So, the updated state is:
- `storage[0]` is `lookup[u_new]`
- `storage[1]` is `v_new`
- `storage[2]` is -1
- `storage[3]` is 1 or -1 depending on whether `v_new == u_new`
- `storage[4]` is `u_new`
- `storage[9]` is 1 or 3
- `storage[10]` is `v_new`

Output State: **`storage[0]` is `lookup[u_new]`, `storage[1]` is `v_new`, `storage[2]` is -1, `storage[3]` is 1 or -1 depending on whether `v_new == u_new`, `storage[4]` is `u_new`, `storage[9]` is 1 or 3, `storage[10]` is `v_new`**
