According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. For the loop to execute again, `-c` must be less than or equal to the length of `new_nodes`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `new_nodes` is a list.
- `index` is the last value of `index` before the loop breaks.
- `abort` is `True`.
- `flag` is the value of `nodes[index * 2 + k]` where `k` is such that the loop breaks due to `flag == -1` or `flag == 1`.
- `count` is `-1`.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `c` must be adjusted so that `-c` is less than or equal to `len(new_nodes)`.
- `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `-c` must be less than or equal to `len(new_nodes)`.

Let's assume that `c` is adjusted so that `-c` is less than or equal to `len(new_nodes)`, and `j` starts from `-c` and goes down to `-1`.

State: **`new_nodes` is a list, `index` is the last value of `index` before the loop breaks, `abort` is `True`, `flag` is the value of `nodes[index * 2 + k]` where `k` is such that the loop breaks due to `flag == -1` or `flag == 1`, `count` is `-1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `c` is adjusted so that `-c` is less than or equal to `len(new_nodes)`, and `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1`.**
