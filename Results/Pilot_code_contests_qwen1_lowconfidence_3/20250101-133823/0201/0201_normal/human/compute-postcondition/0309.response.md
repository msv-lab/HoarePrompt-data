Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is `[p, p]`, `index` is `index`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` based on `flag == -1`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 2]`, `count` retains its value, `i` retains its value, `p` is `index * 2`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same whether the if condition (`flag == 1`) is true or false.***
