`flag` is assigned the value of `nodes[p + 1]`. Given the initial state, the value of `p` is `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2] * 2`, so `flag` becomes `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2] * 2 + 1`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2]`, `p` is `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2] * 2`, `abort` remains `False` if `flag` is not -1 and `True` if `flag` equals -1, and `index` is equal to `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2]`; `flag` is `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2] * 2 + 1`**
