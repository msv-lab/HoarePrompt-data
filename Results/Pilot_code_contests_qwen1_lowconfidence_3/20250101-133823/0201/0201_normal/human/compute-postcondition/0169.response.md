The code `nodes[p + 1] = -1` does not change the value of `nodes[p + 1]` since it is already `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing at least one element, `p` is the updated value of `index * 2`, `abort` is `True`, `index` is the updated value of `nodes[p]`, `flag` is the updated value of `nodes[p] + 1`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1**
