The code assigns the value of `nodes[index * 2]` to `parent_index`. The value of `index` was popped from the `stack`, so `index` is no longer in the `stack`. However, the `nodes` list remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nodes` and the `stack` must not be empty; `index` is the value popped from the `stack`; `parent_index` is the value of `nodes[index * 2]`.

Output State: **`nodes` and the `stack` must not be empty; `index` is the value popped from the `stack`; `parent_index` is the value of `nodes[index * 2]`**
