The code snippet `stack_append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the `stack`. Given the initial state:

- `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with the element at index `storage[t + 1] * 2` set to `n`, the element at index `v * 2` set to `n`, and all other elements are 0.
- `stack` contains `storage[t + 1], storage[t + 1]`.
- `index` is `n`.
- `t` is `val`.
- `v` is `storage[1]`.
- `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`.
- `stack_append` references the `append` method of `stack`.
- `parent_index` is 0.

After executing `stack_append(v)`:

- The value of `v` is appended to the `stack`, which was initially `[storage[t + 1], storage[t + 1]]`.

Therefore, the updated `stack` is `[storage[t + 1], storage[t + 1], v]`.

Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with the element at index `storage[t + 1] * 2` set to `n`, the element at index `v * 2` set to `n`, and all other elements are 0; `stack` contains `[storage[t + 1], storage[t + 1], v]`; `index` is `n`; `t` is `val`; `v` is `storage[1]`; `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`; `stack_append` references the `append` method of `stack`; `parent_index` is 0.**
