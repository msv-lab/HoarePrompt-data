Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing elements `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, ..., nodes[index] * 2 ...]` where each element in the list is the result of the operation `nodes[index] * 2` starting from `n * 2` and continuing until the condition `flag == -1` or `index <= 0` is met, `p` is the final value of `index * 2`, `abort` is `True`, `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`, and `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`.***
