The code `break` does not affect any variable values but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the execution will exit the current context.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2]`, `p` is `index * 2`, `abort` remains `False`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`, `index` is equal to `nodes[n * 2]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
