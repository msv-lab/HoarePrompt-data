The code `new_nodes.append(p)` appends the value of `p` to the list `new_nodes`. Given the initial state:

- `new_nodes` is an empty list.
- `index` is 0 or less.
- `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on the condition `flag == -1`.
- If `flag == -1`, `abort` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `abort` remains `False`.
- `flag` is set to -1 if the condition is true, otherwise it is set to 1.
- All other variables (`c`, `count`, `i`) retain their values as specified in the precondition.

After executing the code, `new_nodes` will contain the value of `p` added to the list. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p]`, `index` is 0 or less, `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on the condition `flag == -1`, `flag` is set to -1 if the condition is true, otherwise it is set to 1, and all other variables (`c`, `count`, `i`) retain their values as specified in the precondition.**
