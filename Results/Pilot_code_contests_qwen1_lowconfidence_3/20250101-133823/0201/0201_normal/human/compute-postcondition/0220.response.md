Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is [p], `count` must be greater than 0, `index` must be less than or equal to 0, `abort` must be `False`, and `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`. If `flag` equals 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if `flag` does not equal 1.***
