Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over elements in `new_nodes` using the variable `p`.

2. **Current States at End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `new_nodes` is not an empty list.
   - `p` is the next element in `new_nodes`.
   - `index` is the last value of `index` before the loop breaks.
   - `abort` is `True`.
   - `flag` is the value of `nodes[index * 2 + k]`, where `k` is such that the loop breaks due to `flag == -1` or `flag == 1`.
   - `count` is `-1`.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`.

3. **Determine Next Iteration State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `p` must be the next element in `new_nodes`.
   - Since the loop has already executed for the current `p`, the next `p` will be the next element in `new_nodes`.

4. **Adjust States**:
   - `new_nodes` remains the same as it is not exhausted yet.
   - `p` becomes the next element in `new_nodes`.
   - `index` remains the same as it was the last value before the loop broke.
   - `abort` remains `True` because it is a condition that controls the loop execution.
   - `flag` remains the same as it was determined during the last iteration.
   - `count` remains `-1` unless the loop body changes this value.
   - `i` remains `n - 1` unless the loop body changes this value.
   - `nodes[p + 1]` remains `-1` unless the loop body changes this value.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The loop will execute one more time if there are more elements in `new_nodes`.
   - The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next element in `new_nodes`.

State: **`new_nodes` must not be an empty list, `p` is the next element in `new_nodes`, `index` is the last value of `index` before the loop breaks, `abort` is `True`, `flag` is the value of `nodes[index * 2 + k]` where `k` is such that the loop breaks due to `flag == -1` or `flag == 1`, `count` is -1, `i` is `n - 1`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1**
