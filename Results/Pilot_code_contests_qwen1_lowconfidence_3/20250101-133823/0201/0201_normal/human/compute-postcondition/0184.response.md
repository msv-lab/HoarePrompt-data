The `break` statement does not change the values of variables but rather breaks out of a loop or a nested structure. Since there is no loop or nested structure context given, we assume this is outside of such a structure, meaning the variables remain unchanged after the execution of the `break` statement.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, for every `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is equal to `1`, `count` is `0`.**
