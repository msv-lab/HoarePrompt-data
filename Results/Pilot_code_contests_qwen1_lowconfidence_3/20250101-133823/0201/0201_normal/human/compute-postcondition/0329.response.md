To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given conditions and requirements step by step.

### Given States Before the Loop:
- `new_nodes` is a list containing values of `p` obtained during each iteration until the loop breaks.
- `index` is the last value of `index` before the loop breaks.
- `abort` is `True`.
- `flag` is the value of `nodes[index * 2 + k]` where `k` is such that the loop breaks due to `flag == -1` or `flag == 1`.
- `count` is `-1`.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `c` is `-1 - len(new_nodes)` and `c` is greater than or equal to 0.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The `for p in new_nodes:` loop iterates over each element in `new_nodes`. For the loop to execute, `new_nodes` must contain at least one element (otherwise, the loop will not start).

2. **Variables in Loop Body**: The loop body processes each `p` from `new_nodes`. Since we are not given specific details about what the loop body does, we focus on ensuring `new_nodes` has at least one element for the loop to start executing.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - `index`, `abort`, `flag`, `count`, `i`, and `c` are not directly related to the condition for the loop to start executing. They might affect the behavior inside the loop but do not impact the starting condition of the loop itself.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is `new_nodes` should contain at least one element.

### Final Answer:
State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one element**
