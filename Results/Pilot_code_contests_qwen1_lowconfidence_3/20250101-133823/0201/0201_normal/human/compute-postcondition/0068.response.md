`t` is assigned the value of `storage[t]`. The value of `storage[t + 1]` is now referenced by `v`, but `v` itself does not change. The `stack` and `nodes` remain unaffected. The value of `parent_index` remains the same as it was previously calculated as `nodes[index * 2]`.

Output State: **`nodes` and the `stack` must not be empty; `index` is the value popped from the `stack`; `parent_index` is the value of `nodes[index * 2]`; `t` is now equal to `storage[t]`; `v` is `storage[t + 1]`**
