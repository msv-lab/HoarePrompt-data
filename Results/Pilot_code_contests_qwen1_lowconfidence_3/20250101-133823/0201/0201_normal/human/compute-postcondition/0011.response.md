The value of `storage_index` is incremented by 2. Initially, `storage_index` was 3, so after adding 2, the new value of `storage_index` is 5. All other variables and their values remain unchanged according to the initial state description.

Output State: **`storage` is a list of length 4 * n with `storage[0]` being `lookup[u]`, `storage[1]` being `v`, `storage[2]` being -1, `storage[3]` being either 1 or -1 depending on whether `v == u`, and `storage[4]` being `u`; `storage_index` is 5; `n` is an integer representing the number of districts (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6); `k` is an integer representing the number of contestants to be removed (1 ≤ k < n); `edges` is a list of tuples representing roads; `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with `lookup[u]` being 1, `lookup[v]` being 3, and all other elements being -1.**
