The function `func_1(n, k, edges)` is called with the given parameters. However, the function itself is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact changes it will make to the variables. Based on the initial state and the call to the function, the following is the output state:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^6`; `edges` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing a road connecting districts; the function `func_1(n, k, edges)` has been called.**
