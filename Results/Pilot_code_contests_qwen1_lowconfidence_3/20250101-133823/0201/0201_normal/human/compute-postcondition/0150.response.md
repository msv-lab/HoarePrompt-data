Let's analyze the given program state and the `while True` loop to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given States:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2]`.
- `p` is `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2] * 2`.
- `abort` is `False` if `flag` is not -1 and `True` if `flag` equals -1.
- `index` is equal to `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2]`.

### Analysis of the `while True` Loop:
- A `while True` loop will always execute unless explicitly stopped (e.g., by setting a condition that breaks the loop).

### Current State:
- Since it's a `while True` loop, the loop will always execute at least one more time regardless of the current values of the variables.

### Conclusion:
Since the `while True` loop will always execute another iteration, no state needs to be adjusted based on the loop condition itself. The loop will proceed to the next iteration regardless of the current values of the variables.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2]`, `p` is `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2] * 2`, `abort` remains `False` if `flag` is not -1 and `True` if `flag` equals -1, and `index` is equal to `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2]`**.

The loop will continue to execute one more time without any adjustments to the given states.
