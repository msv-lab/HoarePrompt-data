The code `t = storage[t]` updates the value of `t` to be whatever value is stored at the index `t` in the `storage` list. Given the initial state, the value of `t` is updated to the value at `storage[t]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `stack` contains `v` and possibly other elements, `index` is unchanged, `parent_index` is unchanged, `t` is now `storage[t]`, `v` is now `storage[t + 1]`, and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.**
