Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is `[p, p]`, `count` is greater than 0, `index` is `p`, `abort` is either `True` or `False`, and `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`. If `flag == -1`, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block. If `flag == 1`, we also break out of the most internal loop or conditional block. If neither condition is met, the original preconditions remain unchanged.***
