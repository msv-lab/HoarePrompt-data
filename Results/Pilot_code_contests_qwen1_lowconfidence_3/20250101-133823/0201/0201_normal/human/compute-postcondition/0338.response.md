The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `count` and `c`. It only breaks out of the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since no loop or if statement is mentioned in the initial state, the only effect of the `break` statement is to indicate that we would exit from the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `c` is its initial value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
