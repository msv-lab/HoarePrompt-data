According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `new_nodes`. For the loop to execute again, `new_nodes` must contain at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration, `new_nodes` must contain at least one element, and `nodes[p + 1]` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to select the next element from `new_nodes` and ensure that `nodes[p + 1]` is defined and valid for this new value of `p`.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Since `new_nodes` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute, let's assume it contains at least two elements (since we need to check the next element).
2. The current iteration used an element from `new_nodes`, so there is at least one remaining element.
3. The loop variable `p` in the current iteration is set to some value from `new_nodes`.
4. For the next iteration, `p` will be set to the next element in `new_nodes`.

Given that `new_nodes` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute, and assuming it contains at least two elements, the next state should reflect the updated values for `new_nodes` and `p`.

State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least two elements, `nodes[p + 1]` is defined and valid**. 

Since we don't know the exact value of the next element in `new_nodes`, we can only generalize the state based on the conditions provided.

Final state:
State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least two elements, `nodes[p + 1]` is defined and valid**.
