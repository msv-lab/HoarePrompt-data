`nodes[p + 1]` is assigned the value `-1`. This changes the value of the element in the `nodes` list at index `p + 1`. The other variables (`new_nodes`, `p`, `index`, `abort`, and `flag`) are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`new_nodes` is a list containing the values of `p` until the loop condition is no longer satisfied, `p` is the last value of `index * 2` computed before the loop exited, `index` is greater than 0, `abort` is `True` if `flag` was `-1` at any point, otherwise `False` if `flag` was `1` at any point, and `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`, now `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`.**
