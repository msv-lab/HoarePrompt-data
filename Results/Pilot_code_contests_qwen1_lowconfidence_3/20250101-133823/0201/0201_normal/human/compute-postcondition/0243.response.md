Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `new_nodes` is a list containing the values of `p` until the loop condition is no longer satisfied.
- `p` is the last value of `index * 2` computed before the loop exited.
- `index` is greater than 0.
- `abort` is `True` if `flag` was `-1` at any point, otherwise `False` if `flag` was `1` at any point.
- `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`, and it is now `-1`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as `p` is in `new_nodes`.

### Loop Iteration:
At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has just processed the current value of `p`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `p` must still be in `new_nodes`.

### Key Points:
- The loop exits when the condition `p in new_nodes` fails.
- Since `flag` is now `-1`, `abort` is likely to be `True` (though this might not directly affect the loop condition).
- `index` being greater than 0 means that there were valid `p` values in the previous iterations, but we need to ensure the next `p` is still valid.

### Next Iteration:
For the loop to continue, the next value of `p` (which is `index * 2`) must be in `new_nodes`.

### Adjusted States:
- `new_nodes` remains the same since the list hasn't changed.
- `p` becomes the next value in the sequence, which is `index * 2`.
- `index` increases by 1 to reflect the next iteration.
- `abort` remains `True` because `flag` is `-1`.

### Final State:
State: **`new_nodes` is a list containing the values of `p` until the loop condition is no longer satisfied, `p` is the next value of `index * 2` (which is `(index + 1) * 2`), `index` is 1 more than the previous value (so `index` is now `index + 1`), `abort` is `True`**.

So, the final state is:

State: **`new_nodes` is a list containing the values of `p` until the loop condition is no longer satisfied, `p` is the next value of `index * 2` (which is `(index + 1) * 2`), `index` is 1 more than the previous value (so `index` is now `index + 1`), `abort` is `True`**.
