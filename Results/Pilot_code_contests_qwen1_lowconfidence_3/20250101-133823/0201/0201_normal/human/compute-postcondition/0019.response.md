The code snippet `lookup[v] = storage_index` assigns the value of `storage_index` to `lookup[v]`. Let's analyze the impact on each variable:

- `storage[0]` is still `lookup[u_new]`.
- `storage[1]` is still `v_new`.
- `storage[2]` remains `-1`.
- `storage[3]` is still `1` or `-1` depending on whether `v_new == u_new`.
- `storage[4]` is still `u_new`.
- `storage[9]` is still `1` or `3`.
- `storage[10]` is still `v_new`.
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` is still `u_new`.
- `storage[storage_index + 2]` is still `lookup[v]`.

After executing the code, `lookup[v]` now holds the value of `storage_index`.

Output State: **`storage[0]` is `lookup[u_new]`, `storage[1]` is `v_new`, `storage[2]` is `-1`, `storage[3]` is `1` or `-1` depending on whether `v_new == u_new`, `storage[4]` is `u_new`, `storage[9]` is `1` or `3`, `storage[10]` is `v_new`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u_new`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is `lookup[v]`, `lookup[v]` is `storage_index`**
