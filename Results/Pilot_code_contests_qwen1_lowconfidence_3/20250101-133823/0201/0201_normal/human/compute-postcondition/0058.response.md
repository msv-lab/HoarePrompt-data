Postcondition: ***`nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with the element at index `storage[t + 1] * 2` set to `n`, and all other elements are 0; `stack` contains `storage[t + 1], storage[t + 1]`; `index` is `n`; `t` is `val`; `v` is `storage[1]`; `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`; `stack_append` references the `append` method of `stack`; `parent_index` is 0. If `v` equals `parent_index`, no changes are made to the stack.***
