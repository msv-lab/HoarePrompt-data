Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Conditions:**
   - `new_nodes` is a list.
   - `index` is the last value of `index` before the loop breaks.
   - `abort` is `True`.
   - `flag` is the value of `nodes[index * 2 + k]` where `k` is such that the loop breaks due to `flag == -1` or `flag == 1`.
   - `count` is `-1`.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `c` is adjusted so that `-c` is less than or equal to `len(new_nodes)`.
   - `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop `for j in xrange(-c)` runs from `-c` to `-1` (inclusive). Since the loop body is omitted, we need to focus on the condition for the loop to continue.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be in the range `-c` to `-1`. 
   - Since `j` starts from `-c` and goes up to `-1`, the loop will run for `c + 1` iterations.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute one more time if `j` is `-c`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `new_nodes` remains unchanged.
   - `index` remains unchanged.
   - `abort` remains `True`.
   - `flag` remains unchanged.
   - `count` remains `-1`.
   - `i` remains `n - 1`.
   - `c` remains unchanged.
   - `j` will be `-c` at the start of the next iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`new_nodes` is a list, `index` is the last value of `index` before the loop breaks, `abort` is `True`, `flag` is the value of `nodes[index * 2 + k]` where `k` is such that the loop breaks due to `flag == -1` or `flag == 1`, `count` is `-1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `c` is adjusted so that `-c` is less than or equal to `len(new_nodes)`, and `j` is `-c`**.
