The code `nodes[v * 2] = index` updates the value of `nodes[v * 2]` to be `index`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. `nodes[v * 2]` is updated to be `index`.
2. The values of the other variables (`stack`, `index`, `parent_index`, `t`, `v`) are not affected.

Given the initial state:
- `nodes` and `stack` must not be empty.
- `index` is the value popped from the `stack`.
- `parent_index` is the value of `nodes[index * 2]`.
- `t` is now equal to `storage[t]`.
- `v` is `storage[t + 1]`.

Since `v` is checked against `parent_index` but no change is made if they are equal, this condition does not affect the update of `nodes[v * 2]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `nodes[v * 2]` is now `index`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `stack`, `index`, `parent_index`, `t`, and `v` remain unchanged.**
