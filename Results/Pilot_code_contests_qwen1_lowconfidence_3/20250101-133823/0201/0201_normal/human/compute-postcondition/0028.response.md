The code `lookup[v] = storage_index` assigns the value of `storage_index` to `lookup[v]`. This means that the previous value of `lookup[v]` (which was `storage_index`) remains unchanged, but now `lookup[v]` is explicitly set to `storage_index`.

All other variables remain in their initial or previously calculated states.

Output State: **`storage[0] = lookup[u_new]`, `storage[1] = v_new`, `storage[2] = -1`, `storage[3] = 1` or `-1`, `storage[4] = u_new`, `storage[9] = 1` or `3`, `storage[10] = v_new`, `storage[storage_index] = storage_index`, `storage[storage_index + 1] = u`, `storage[storage_index + 2] = lookup[v]`, `lookup[v] = storage_index`, `storage_index` is increased by 2**
