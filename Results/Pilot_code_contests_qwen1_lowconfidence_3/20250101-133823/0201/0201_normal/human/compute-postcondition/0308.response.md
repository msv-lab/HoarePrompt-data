The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the loop or conditional block we are currently inside. However, since no loop or conditional block is specified in the given code, the variables `new_nodes`, `index`, `abort`, `flag`, `count`, `i`, and `p` remain unchanged. The `abort` variable is set based on the condition `flag == -1`, but this condition is not re-evaluated by the `break` statement.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p, p]`, `index` is `index`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` based on `flag == -1`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 2]`, `count` retains its value, `i` retains its value, `p` is `index * 2`**
