`storage_index` is incremented by 2. The initial value of `storage_index` is not explicitly given, but it is referenced in other parts of the state. The only direct change is to `storage_index`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage[0]` is `lookup[u_new]`, `storage[1]` is `v_new`, `storage[2]` is `-1`, `storage[3]` is `1` or `-1` depending on whether `v_new == u_new`, `storage[4]` is `u_new`, `storage[9]` is `1` or `3`, `storage[10]` is `v_new`, `storage_index` is increased by 2, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u_new`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is `lookup[v]`, `lookup[v]` is `storage_index`**
