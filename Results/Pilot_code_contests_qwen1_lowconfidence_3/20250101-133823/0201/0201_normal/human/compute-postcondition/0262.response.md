Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is an empty list; for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is 1; `index` is 0 or less; `abort` is `True` if `flag` was `-1` at any point during the loop, otherwise `False` if `flag` was `1` at any point; `flag` is undefined; `c` is equal to `count`; `count` is equal to `c`; `count` is 0.***
