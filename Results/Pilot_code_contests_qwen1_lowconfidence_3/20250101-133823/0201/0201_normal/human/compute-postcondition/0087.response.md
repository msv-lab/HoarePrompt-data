The code `stack_append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the `stack`. Given the initial state, the value of `v` is `storage[t + 1]`. The other variables (`nodes`, `index`, `parent_index`, `t`, and the contents of `stack` excluding `v`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, after executing the code, the updated state is:

- `nodes[v * 2]` is `index`
- `stack` contains `v` (which is `storage[t + 1]`) plus possibly other elements
- `index` is unchanged
- `parent_index` is unchanged
- `t` is now `storage[t]`
- `v` is now `storage[t + 1]`
- `stack` has `v` appended to it

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `stack` contains `v` (which is `storage[t + 1]`) plus possibly other elements, `index` is unchanged, `parent_index` is unchanged, `t` is now `storage[t]`, `v` is now `storage[t + 1]`**
