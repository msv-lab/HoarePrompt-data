The code `sys.setcheckinterval(2147483647)` sets the interval at which Python performs its cycle detector and garbage collector. However, this does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `k`, or `edges`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^6, representing the number of districts and the number of contestants to remove, respectively; `edges` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers a and b representing a road connecting districts a and b.**
