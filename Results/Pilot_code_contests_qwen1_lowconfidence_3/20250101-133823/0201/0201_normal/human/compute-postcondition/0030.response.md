Let's analyze the given loop and determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have executed.

### Initial State:
- `storage` is a list of length \(4 \times n\) filled with \(-1\).
- `n` is an integer representing the number of districts (\(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\)).
- `k` is an integer representing the number of contestants to be removed (\(1 \leq k < n\)).
- `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple \((u, v)\) represents a bidirectional road connecting districts \(u\) and \(v\) (\(1 \leq u, v \leq n, u \neq v\)).
- `storage_index` is \(0\).
- `lookup` is a list of length \(n + 1\) filled with \(-1\).

### Loop Code:
```python
for u, v in edges:
    storage[storage_index] = lookup[u]
    storage[storage_index + 1] = v
    lookup[u] = storage_index
    storage_index += 2
    storage[storage_index] = lookup[v]
    storage[storage_index + 1] = u
    lookup[v] = storage_index
    storage_index += 2
```

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization and First Iteration:**
   - Initially, `storage_index` is \(0\).
   - For the first iteration, let's say we process \((u_1, v_1)\):
     - `storage[0] = lookup[u_1]`
     - `storage[1] = v_1`
     - `lookup[u_1] = 0`
     - `storage_index = 2`
     - `storage[2] = lookup[v_1]`
     - `storage[3] = u_1`
     - `lookup[v_1] = 2`
     - `storage_index = 4`

2. **Subsequent Iterations:**
   - Each iteration processes another edge \((u_i, v_i)\):
     - `storage[storage_index] = lookup[u_i]`
     - `storage[storage_index + 1] = v_i`
     - `lookup[u_i] = storage_index`
     - `storage_index += 2`
     - `storage[storage_index] = lookup[v_i]`
     - `storage[storage_index + 1] = u_i`
     - `lookup[v_i] = storage_index`
     - `storage_index += 2`

3. **Final State:**
   - After processing all \(m\) edges, `storage_index` will be \(4 \times m\).
   - The loop will ensure that for each edge \((u_i, v_i)\), the following entries are made in `storage`:
     - `storage[4i] = lookup[u_i]`
     - `storage[4i + 1] = v_i`
     - `storage[4i + 2] = lookup[v_i]`
     - `storage[4i + 3] = u_i`
   - Since there are \(m\) edges, \(m = n\). Therefore, the final `storage_index` will be \(4n\).

4. **Final Values of Variables:**
   - `storage` will contain \(4n\) entries. For each edge \((u_i, v_i)\), the corresponding entries in `storage` will be:
     - `storage[4i] = lookup[u_i]`
     - `storage[4i + 1] = v_i`
     - `storage[4i + 2] = lookup[v_i]`
     - `storage[4i + 3] = u_i`
   - `storage_index` will be \(4n\).
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `edges` remains unchanged.
   - `lookup` will be updated such that for each district \(u\), `lookup[u]` contains the index in `storage` where the pair involving \(u\) starts.

### Output State:
**Output State: **`storage` is a list of length \(4n\) where for each edge \((u_i, v_i)\), the following entries are made: `storage[4i] = lookup[u_i]`, `storage[4i + 1] = v_i`, `storage[4i + 2] = lookup[v_i]`, `storage[4i + 3] = u_i`, `storage_index` is \(4n\), `n` is an integer representing the number of districts (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), `k` is an integer representing the number of contestants to be removed (1 ≤ k < n), `edges` is a list of tuples representing roads, `lookup` is a list of length \(n + 1\) with `lookup[u]` containing the index in `storage` for each district \(u\).**
