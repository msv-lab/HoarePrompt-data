The code `t = storage[t]` updates the value of `t` by assigning it the value stored at the index specified by `t` in the `storage` list. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is `lookup[index]` and must be greater than or equal to 0, and given that `storage[t]` is accessed, the value of `t` changes to the value at `storage[t]`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `nodes[v * 2]` is still `index`.
- `stack` is still missing the last element (previously `v`).
- `index` remains the value popped from the stack.
- `parent_index` remains `nodes[index * 2]`.
- `v` remains `storage[lookup[index] + 1]`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `t` is now `storage[lookup[index]]`.

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `stack` is missing the last element (previously `v`), `index` is the value popped from the stack, `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]`, `t` is `storage[lookup[index]]`, `v` is `storage[lookup[index] + 1]`.**
