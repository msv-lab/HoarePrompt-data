Postcondition: ***`nodes` has an element at index `v * 2` set to `index`; `v` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`; the stack contains the value `storage[t + 1]` appended to it; `t` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`. If `v` equals `parent_index`, these conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, no change occurs since there is no else part in the code.***
