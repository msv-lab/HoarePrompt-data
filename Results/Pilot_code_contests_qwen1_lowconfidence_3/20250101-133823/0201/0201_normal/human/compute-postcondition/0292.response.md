Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute as long as the loop body does not explicitly break out of the loop.

2. **Identify the Variables and Their Current States**:
   - `new_nodes` is `[p]`
   - `index` is `nodes[p]`
   - `abort` is either `True` or `False` based on the condition `flag == -1`
   - `flag` is set to `-1`
   - `count` retains its value from the previous iteration
   - `i` retains its value from the previous iteration
   - `p` is `index * 2`

3. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted**:
   Since the loop is `while True`, no specific conditions need to be met for the loop to continue executing. The only thing that matters is ensuring that the loop continues without any external breaking condition.

Given that the loop is an infinite loop (`while True`), we don't need to adjust any specific states for the loop to continue executing. We just need to retain the current state as it is.

Therefore, the state remains the same as the one provided at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`new_nodes` is `[p]`, `index` is `nodes[p]`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` based on `flag == -1`, `flag` is set to `-1`, `count` retains its value, `i` retains its value, and `p` is `index * 2`**
