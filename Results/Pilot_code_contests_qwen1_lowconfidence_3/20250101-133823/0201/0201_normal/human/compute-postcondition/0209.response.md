`new_nodes.append(p)` appends the value of `p` to the list `new_nodes`. Given that `new_nodes` is initially an empty list, after appending `p`, `new_nodes` will contain `[p]`.

Let's check the other variables:
- `count` is adjusted by subtracting the length of `new_nodes`, which means `count` is decreased by 1.
- `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1` for all `j` in the range of `-c` to `0`, this condition remains unchanged.
- `p` is `i * 2`, this value remains unchanged.
- `abort` is `True` if `flag` is `-1`; otherwise, `abort` is `False` and `flag` is `1` if it was `nodes[p + 1]` and equals `1`. This condition also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is [p], `count` is adjusted by subtracting 1 from its original value, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1` for all `j` in the range of `-c` to `0`, `p` is `i * 2`, `abort` is `True` if `flag` is `-1`; otherwise, `abort` is `False` and `flag` is `1` if it was `nodes[p + 1]` and equals `1`.**
