Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `new_nodes` is a list containing the values of `p` until the loop condition is no longer satisfied.
   - For each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`.
   - `index` is `0` or less.
   - `abort` is `True` if `flag` was `-1` at any point during the loop, otherwise `False` if `flag` was `1` at any point.
   - `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]` if the loop did not break due to `index <= 0`.
   - `c` is `c - 1` and `c` must be less than `0`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in xrange(-c):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `-c` to `0` (exclusive).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is already less than `0`, meaning `-c` is a positive integer.
   - The loop variable `j` starts from `-c` and increments by `1` each iteration until it reaches `0`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `j` starts from `-c` and increases by `1`, the new value of `j` will be `-c + 1`.
   - `c` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify it; it only decrements once before the loop starts.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `new_nodes` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `index` remains `0` or less, as the loop does not affect this variable.
   - `abort` remains `True` or `False` based on the condition during the loop execution.
   - `flag` remains as it was determined at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `c` remains less than `0` as it is decremented to less than `0` before the loop starts.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`new_nodes` is a list containing the values of `p` until the loop condition is no longer satisfied; for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`; `index` is `0` or less; `abort` is `True` if `flag` was `-1` at any point during the loop, otherwise `False` if `flag` was `1` at any point; `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]` if the loop did not break due to `index <= 0`; `c` is `-c + 1` and `c` must be less than `0`**.
