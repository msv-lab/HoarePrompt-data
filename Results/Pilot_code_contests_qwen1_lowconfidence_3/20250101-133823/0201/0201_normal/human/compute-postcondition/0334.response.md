`nodes[p + 1]` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `p` is set to the next element in `new_nodes` after the current `p`, but since the assignment only affects `nodes[p + 1]`, the value of `p` itself does not change. The initial state conditions that `new_nodes` must contain at least two elements and `nodes[p + 1]` was previously `1` remain valid.

Output State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least two elements, `nodes[p + 1]` is 1, `p` must be the next element in `new_nodes` after the current `p`**
