Let's analyze the given conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `new_nodes` is an empty list.
   - `count` is adjusted by subtracting the length of `new_nodes`. Since `new_nodes` is empty, `count` remains unchanged.
   - `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1` for all `j` in the range of `-c` to `0`. Since `new_nodes` is empty, this condition is vacuously true.
   - `p` is `i * 2`.
   - `abort` is `False`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop is a `while True` loop, meaning it will always execute at least once regardless of the initial state.

Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute at least once, and no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time based on the provided conditions.

**Answer:**
State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `count` is adjusted by subtracting the length of `new_nodes`, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1` for all `j` in the range of `-c` to `0`, `p` is `i * 2`, `abort` is `False`**
