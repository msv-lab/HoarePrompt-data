The code `t = storage[t]` changes the value of `t` to be the value at the index `t` in the `storage` list. The initial state is that `v` is the value at index `t + 1` in the `storage` list, `storage` is a list, and `t` is an index within the bounds of `storage`. After executing the code, `t` will be updated to the value that was previously at index `t` in `storage`. The value of `v` remains unchanged because the code does not affect `v`.

Output State: **`v` is the value at index `t + 1` in the `storage` list; `storage` is a list; `t` is now the value at index `t` in `storage`**
