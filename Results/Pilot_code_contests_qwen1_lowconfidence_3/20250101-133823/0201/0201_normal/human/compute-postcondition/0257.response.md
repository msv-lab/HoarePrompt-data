`nodes[p + 1]` is assigned the value `1`. The initial state mentions that `new_nodes` contains at least one value and `nodes[p + 1]` is yet to be determined for the next value in `new_nodes`. After executing the code, `nodes[p + 1]` is now determined to be `1`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` contains at least one value; `nodes[p + 1]` is 1**
