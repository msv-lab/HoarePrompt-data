Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is `[p, p]`, `count` must be greater than 0, `index` is `p`, `abort` is either `True` or `False`, and `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`. If `flag == 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same regardless of the if condition.***
