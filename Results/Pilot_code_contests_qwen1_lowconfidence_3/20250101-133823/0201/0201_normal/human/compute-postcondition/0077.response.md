The `continue` statement in the given code does not affect the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `nodes[v * 2]`, `stack`, `index`, `parent_index`, `t`, `v`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `stack` contains `v` and possibly other elements, `index` is unchanged, `parent_index` is unchanged, `t` is now `storage[t]`, `v` is now `storage[t + 1]`, and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.**
