According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p` and the list `new_nodes`. For the loop to execute again, `p` must be an element of `new_nodes` and there must still be at least two elements in `new_nodes`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `new_nodes` must contain at least two elements, and `nodes[p + 1]` is 1. This means that `p` is currently some element from `new_nodes`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `new_nodes` must still contain at least two elements.
2. The value of `p` must be the next element in `new_nodes` after the current `p`.

Given these conditions, we need to adjust the state such that `p` becomes the next element in `new_nodes`, and `new_nodes` still contains at least two elements.

State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least two elements, `nodes[p + 1]` is 1, `p` must be the next element in `new_nodes` after the current `p`**
