The variable `abort` is assigned the value `False`. This initializes the `abort` variable but does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `new_nodes`, or `p`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is an empty list, and `p` is `n * 2` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is `n * 2`, `abort` is `False`**
