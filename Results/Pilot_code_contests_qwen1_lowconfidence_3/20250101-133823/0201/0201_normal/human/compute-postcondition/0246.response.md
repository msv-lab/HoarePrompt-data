The code `nodes[p + 1] = -1` updates the element in the `nodes` list at the index `p + 1` to `-1`. Given that `p` is `6`, the index becomes `6 + 1 = 7`. The value of `new_nodes`, `p`, `index`, and `abort` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least two elements, `p` is 6, `index` is 0, `abort` is `False`, and `nodes[7]` is -1.**
