Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2]`, `p` is `n * 2`, `abort` remains `False` since `flag` does not equal `-1`, `flag` is `nodes[n * 2]` since it was not `-1` initially, and `index` is equal to `nodes[n * 2]`. The current value of `index` is less than or equal to 0.***
