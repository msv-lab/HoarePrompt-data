Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `stack` may contain multiple elements including `v` (which is `storage[t + 1]`) and possibly other elements, `index` is unchanged, `parent_index` is unchanged, `t` is the final value after the last iteration of the loop, `v` is the final value after the last iteration of the loop, and `t` must be -1 or less since the loop condition `t >= 0` fails.**
