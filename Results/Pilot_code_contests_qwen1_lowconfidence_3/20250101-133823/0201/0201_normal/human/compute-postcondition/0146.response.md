The code `index = nodes[p]` assigns the value of `nodes[p]` to the variable `index`. From the initial state, we know that `p` is `index * 2`, and `index` is equal to `nodes[n * 2]`. Therefore, `p` is `nodes[n * 2] * 2`.

So, `index` is now assigned the value of `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2]`, `p` is `nodes[n * 2] * 2`, `abort` remains `False` if `flag` is not -1, and `abort` is `True` if `flag` equals -1, and `index` is equal to `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2]`.**
