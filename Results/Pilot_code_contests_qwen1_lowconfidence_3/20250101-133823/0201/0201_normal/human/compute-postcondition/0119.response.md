The code `new_nodes = []` initializes an empty list for the variable `new_nodes`. The values of the other variables (`n` and `i`) are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is an empty list**
