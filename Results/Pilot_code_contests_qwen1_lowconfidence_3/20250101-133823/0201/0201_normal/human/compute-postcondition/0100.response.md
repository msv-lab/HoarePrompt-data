The code `stack_append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the stack. The previous state includes the following variables:
- `nodes[v * 2]` is `index`
- `stack` is missing the last element (previously `v`)
- `index` is the value popped from the stack
- `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]` which equals `v`
- `t` is `storage[lookup[index]]`
- `v` is `storage[lookup[index] + 1]`

After executing the code, the stack will have the value of `v` appended to it. Therefore, the stack will now be complete with the last element being `v`.

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`; `stack` has the last element as `v`; `index` is the value popped from the stack; `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]` which equals `v`; `t` is `storage[lookup[index]]`; `v` is `storage[lookup[index] + 1]`**
