The variable `p` is reassigned the value of `index * 2`. Given that `index` is equal to `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2] * 2`, the new value of `p` is `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2] * 2 * 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2] * 2]`, `p` is `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2] * 4`, `abort` is `True` if `flag` equals -1 and `False` otherwise, `index` is equal to `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2] * 2`, and `flag` is `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2] * 2 + 1`.
