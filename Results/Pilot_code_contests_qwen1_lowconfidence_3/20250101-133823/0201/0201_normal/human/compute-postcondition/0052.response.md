The code `nodes[v * 2] = index` assigns the value of `index` to the element in the `nodes` list at the index `v * 2`. Given the initial state, let's break down the steps:

1. `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with the element at index `storage[t + 1] * 2` set to `n`, and all other elements are 0.
2. `stack` contains `storage[t + 1]`.
3. `index` is `n`.
4. `t` is `storage[t + 1]`.
5. `v` is `storage[t + 1]`.
6. `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`.
7. `stack_append` references the `append` method of `stack`.
8. `parent_index` is 0.

Since `v` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`, which is also the value of `t`, the index `v * 2` becomes `storage[t + 1] * 2`. This means the element at this index in the `nodes` list will be updated to `index`, which is `n`.

Therefore, the value of `nodes[storage[t + 1] * 2]` will now be `n`, and all other elements in the `nodes` list remain 0 except for the one at `storage[t + 1] * 2`.

Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with the element at index `storage[t + 1] * 2` set to `n`, and all other elements are 0; `stack` contains `storage[t + 1]`; `index` is `n`; `t` is `storage[t + 1]`; `v` is `storage[t + 1]`; `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`; `stack_append` references the `append` method of `stack`; `parent_index` is 0.**
