Let's analyze the given information and determine the necessary adjustments for the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Given Information:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `new_nodes` is a list containing elements `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, ..., nodes[index] * 2]` until the condition `flag == -1` or `index <= 0` is met.
- `p` is the final value of `index * 2`.
- `abort` is `True`.
- `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`.
- `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`.
- For every `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`.
- `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)` and `c` must be less than 0.
- `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for j in xrange(-c):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Range of the Loop**:
   - The loop runs from `j = -c` to `j = -1`.
   - Since `c` is calculated as `count - len(new_nodes)` and `c` is less than 0, `-c` will be a positive number (specifically, the absolute value of `c`).

2. **Initial State After Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `new_nodes` is a list of indices derived from the initial conditions.
   - `p` is the last assigned value of `index * 2`.
   - `abort` is `True`.
   - `index` is the last value of `nodes[p]`.
   - `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`.
   - For each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`.
   - `c` is less than 0, meaning `len(new_nodes) > count`.
   - `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1` for all `j` in the loop range.

3. **State Adjustments for Next Iteration**:
   - Since `c` is negative, `-c` is a positive integer.
   - The loop will run for `-c` iterations, where `j` will range from `-c` to `-1`.
   - After the loop completes, `j` will be `-1`.

4. **Updated States**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as `n`.
   - `new_nodes` remains the same unless modified within the loop body (which is not provided).
   - `p` remains the last value of `index * 2`.
   - `abort` remains `True`.
   - `index` remains the last value of `nodes[p]`.
   - `flag` remains the value of `nodes[p] + 1`.
   - For each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` remains `-1`.
   - `c` remains the same as it is not updated in the loop.
   - `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` remains `-1` for all `j` in the loop range.

### Final Answer:
Since the loop is iterating over a fixed range based on `-c`, and no changes are made to the variables `i`, `new_nodes`, `p`, `abort`, `index`, `flag`, or `nodes`, the states remain the same for the next iteration.

**State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing elements `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, ..., nodes[index] * 2]` until the condition `flag == -1` or `index <= 0` is met, `p` is the final value of `index * 2`, `abort` is `True`, `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`, `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`, for every `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`, `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)` and `c` must be less than 0, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1`**.
