The code `nodes[p + 1] = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the element in the `nodes` list at the index `p + 1`. Based on the initial state, `p` is calculated as `(index + 1) * 2` and `index` is 1 more than the previous value, which means `index` is currently `1 + 1 = 2`. Therefore, `p` is `(2 + 1) * 2 = 6`.

Since `new_nodes` is a list containing the values of `p` until the loop condition is no longer satisfied, the value of `p` (which is 6) is added to `new_nodes` before this assignment. After the assignment, the value at `nodes[7]` (since `p + 1` is `6 + 1 = 7`) is set to `-1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_nodes` contains the value 6, `p` is 6, `index` is 3 (since `index` is incremented by 1), `abort` is `True`, and `nodes[7]` is `-1`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` contains the value 6, `p` is 6, `index` is 3, `abort` is `True`, and `nodes[7]` is `-1`.**
