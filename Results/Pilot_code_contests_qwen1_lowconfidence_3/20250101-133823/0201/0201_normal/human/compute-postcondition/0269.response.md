The code `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` updates the value of `nodes` at the index `new_nodes[j] + 1` to `-1`. This operation does not affect the values of other variables. The initial state is provided, and the only change is to the `nodes` list.

Output State: **new_nodes is a list containing the values of p until the loop condition is no longer satisfied; for each p in new_nodes, nodes[p + 1] is -1 except for new_nodes[j] + 1 which is now -1 again; index is 1; abort is True if flag was -1 at any point during the loop, otherwise False if flag was 1 at any point; flag is nodes[new_nodes[-1] + 1] if the loop did not break due to index <= 0; c is a new negative value such that abs(c) is one less than the current absolute value of c**
