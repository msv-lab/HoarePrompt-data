The code `storage[storage_index] = lookup[u]` assigns the value of `lookup[u]` to `storage[storage_index]`. From the initial state, we know:

- `storage[0]` is `lookup[u_new]`
- `storage[1]` is `v_new`
- `storage[2]` is -1
- `storage[3]` is 1 or -1 depending on whether `v_new == u_new`
- `storage[4]` is `u_new`
- `storage_index` is 9
- `lookup[u]` is either 1 or 3 based on the value of `u`

Given this, `storage[9]` will be set to the value of `lookup[u]`, which is either 1 or 3. The other parts of the `storage` list remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage[0]` is `lookup[u_new]`, `storage[1]` is `v_new`, `storage[2]` is -1, `storage[3]` is 1 or -1 depending on whether `v_new == u_new`, `storage[4]` is `u_new`, `storage[9]` is 1 or 3, and `storage_index` is 9**
