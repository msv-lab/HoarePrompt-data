According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `new_nodes`. For the loop to execute again, `new_nodes` must contain at least one value.

At the end of the previous iteration, `new_nodes` contains at least one value, and `nodes[p + 1]` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to select the next value from `new_nodes`. Since `new_nodes` contains at least one value, it will still contain at least one value for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `new_nodes` still contains at least one value (since it already does and no values are removed or modified within the loop body).
- `nodes[p + 1]` will be checked with the next value from `new_nodes`.

State: **`new_nodes` contains at least one value; `nodes[p + 1]` is yet to be determined for the next value in `new_nodes`**
