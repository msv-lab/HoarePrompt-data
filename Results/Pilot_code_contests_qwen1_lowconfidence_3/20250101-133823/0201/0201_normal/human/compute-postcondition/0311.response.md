The code `new_nodes.append(p)` appends the value of `p` to the list `new_nodes`. Given the initial state, `new_nodes` is `[p, p]`, `index` is `index`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` based on `flag == -1`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 2]`, `count` retains its value, `i` retains its value, and `p` is `index * 2`. 

Since `new_nodes.append(p)` adds `p` to the existing list `new_nodes`, the new value of `new_nodes` will be `[p, p, p]`.

The value of `index`, `abort`, `flag`, `count`, `i`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p, p, p]`, `index` is `index`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` based on `flag == -1`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 2]`, `count` retains its value, `i` retains its value, `p` is `index * 2`.**
