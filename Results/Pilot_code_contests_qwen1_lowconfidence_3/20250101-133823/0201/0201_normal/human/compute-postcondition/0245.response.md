Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `new_nodes` contains the value 6 (so `new_nodes = [6]`)
  - `p` is 6
  - `index` is 3
  - `abort` is `True`
  - `nodes[7]` is `-1`

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for p in new_nodes:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `new_nodes = [6]`
   - `p` starts as 6 (the first and only element in `new_nodes`)
   - `index` is 3
   - `abort` is `True`
   - `nodes[7]` is `-1`

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `new_nodes`.
   - In this case, there is only one element, `6`.

3. **What Happens Inside the Loop:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know the loop checks some conditions. Let's assume the loop sets `p` to the next value in `new_nodes` or increments some index or changes the state based on certain conditions.

4. **After the Loop Iteration:**
   - Since `new_nodes` only contains one element (`6`), after processing `p` (which is `6`), the loop would check if there are any more elements in `new_nodes`.
   - There are no more elements in `new_nodes`, so the loop terminates.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `new_nodes` must contain at least two elements.
   - Additionally, the loop must reset `p` to the first element of the updated `new_nodes` list, `index` to 0, and potentially reset `abort` to `False`.

### Adjusted State:
- `new_nodes` must contain at least two elements (e.g., `[6, x]` where `x` is any value).
- `p` should be set to the first element of the new `new_nodes` list (which is `6` initially but could change if the list changes).
- `index` should be set to 0.
- `abort` should be set to `False`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
**`new_nodes` must contain at least two elements, `p` is 6, `index` is 0, and `abort` is `False`.**

### Final Answer:
State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least two elements, `p` is 6, `index` is 0, and `abort` is `False`.**
