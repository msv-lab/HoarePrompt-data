The code assigns the value `1` to `nodes[p + 1]`. The initial state indicates that `new_nodes` contains at least one value and `nodes[p + 1]` is defined and holds a value. After executing the code, the value of `nodes[p + 1]` is updated to `1`, but the value of `new_nodes` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` contains at least one value; `nodes[p + 1]` is 1**
