`stack_append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the `stack`. The other variables (`nodes[v * 2]`, `stack`, `index`, `parent_index`, `t`, and `v`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the `stack` now contains the value of `v` in addition to its previous elements.

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `stack` contains `v` and possibly other elements, `index` is unchanged, `parent_index` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `v` is unchanged**
