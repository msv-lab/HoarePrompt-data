The code `abort = True` sets the variable `abort` to `True`. This changes the value of `abort` from its previous state (which was `False` if `flag` is not -1 and `True` if `flag` equals -1). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2]`, `p` is `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2] * 2`, `abort` is `True`, and `index` is equal to `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2]; `flag` is `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2] * 2 + 1`**
