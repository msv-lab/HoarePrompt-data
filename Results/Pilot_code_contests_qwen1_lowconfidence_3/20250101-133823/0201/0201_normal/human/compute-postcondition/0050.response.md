The `continue` statement in the given code does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the containing loop. Therefore, the states of all the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with the element at index `storage[t + 1] * 2` set to `n`, and all other elements are 0; `stack` contains `storage[t + 1]`; `index` is `n`; `t` is `storage[t + 1]`; `v` is `storage[t + 1]`; `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`; `stack_append` references the `append` method of `stack`; `parent_index` is 0.**
