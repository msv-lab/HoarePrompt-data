To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the current state.

The `while` loop condition is `t >= 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `t` must still be greater than or equal to 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with the element at index `storage[t + 1] * 2` set to `n`, and all other elements are 0.
- `stack` contains `storage[t + 1]`.
- `index` is `n`.
- `t` is `storage[t + 1]`.
- `v` is `storage[t + 1]`.
- `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`.
- `stack_append` references the `append` method of `stack`.
- `parent_index` is 0.

For the loop to continue, the only condition that matters is `t >= 0`. Since `t` is defined as `storage[t + 1]`, we need to ensure that `storage[t + 1]` is such that `t` remains non-negative.

Let's summarize the required adjustments:
- We need to ensure that `storage[t + 1]` is valid and non-negative, meaning `t` should remain non-negative.

Thus, the state that needs adjustment is:
State: **`nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with the element at index `storage[t + 1] * 2` set to `n`, and all other elements are 0; `stack` contains `storage[t + 1]`; `index` is `n`; `t` is `storage[t + 1]` and must be greater than or equal to 0; `v` is `storage[t + 1]`; `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`; `stack_append` references the `append` method of `stack`; `parent_index` is 0.**
