The code `stack_append = stack.append` does not change the values of any variables or lists; it simply reassigns the variable `stack_append` to reference the `append` method of the `stack` list. The `stack` list and its `pop` method (`stack_pop`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length 2 * (n + 1) with all elements equal to 0; `stack` is ['n']; `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`; `stack_append` references the `append` method of `stack`.**
