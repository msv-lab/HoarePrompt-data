The value of `storage_index` is incremented by 2. The initial value of `storage_index` could be any value since it is not specified in the initial state, but it is incremented by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage[0] = lookup[u_new]`, `storage[1] = v_new`, `storage[2] = -1`, `storage[3] = 1` or `-1` depending on whether `v_new == u_new`, `storage[4] = u_new`, `storage[9] = 1` or `3`, `storage[10] = v_new`, `storage[storage_index] = lookup[u]`, `storage[storage_index + 1] = v`, `storage[storage_index + 2] = lookup[v]`, `lookup[v] = storage_index`, `lookup[u] = storage_index`, `storage_index` is increased by 2**
