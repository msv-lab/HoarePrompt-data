According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute. This means that no specific conditions need to be met for the loop to proceed to the first iteration. Therefore, we do not need to adjust any of the given states.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is `n * 2`, `abort` is `False`**
