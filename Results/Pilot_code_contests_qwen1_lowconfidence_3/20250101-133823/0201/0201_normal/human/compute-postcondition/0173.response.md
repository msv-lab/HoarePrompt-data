The code `c = count - len(new_nodes)` assigns the value of `count - len(new_nodes)` to `c`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `count`, so we cannot determine the exact value of `c`. But we know that `len(new_nodes)` is the length of the list `new_nodes`, and `count` is an unspecified value.

Therefore, the updated state includes the new variable `c` with the value of `count - len(new_nodes)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing elements \([n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, ..., nodes[index] * 2]\) until the condition `flag == -1` or `index \leq 0` is met, `p` is the final value of `index * 2`, `abort` is `True`, `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`, `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`, and for every `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`; `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`.**
