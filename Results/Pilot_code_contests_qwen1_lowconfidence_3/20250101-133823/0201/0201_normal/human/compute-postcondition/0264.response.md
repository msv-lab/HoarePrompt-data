Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `new_nodes` is a list containing the values of `p` until the loop condition is no longer satisfied.
- For each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`.
- `index` is `0` or less.
- `abort` is `True` if `flag` was `-1` at any point during the loop, otherwise `False` if `flag` was `1` at any point.
- `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]` if the loop did not break due to `index <= 0`.
- `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)` and `c` is less than 0.

### For Loop:
```
for j in xrange(-c):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the `xrange` function**: The `xrange(-c)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to -c (exclusive). Since `c` is less than 0, `-c` is positive, meaning the loop will generate a sequence of non-negative integers starting from 0 up to `-c - 1`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < -c`. Therefore, the loop will run for `-c` iterations.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `index` is `0` or less, which means it can be `0` or any negative number. However, this value does not directly affect the loop's execution since the loop condition does not involve `index`.
   - `abort` is either `True` or `False` based on the value of `flag`.
   - `flag` is determined by `nodes[p + 1]` if the loop did not break due to `index <= 0`. This implies that `flag` can only be `-1` or `1` based on the condition.

4. **Key Variables for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `-c` times, where `-c` is the difference between `count` and `len(new_nodes)`, and `c` is less than 0.
   - Therefore, `-c` is a positive integer, indicating the number of iterations the loop will perform.

### Required Adjustments:
- The value of `c` should be adjusted such that `-c` is a positive integer, meaning `c` should be a negative integer.
- Since `c` is derived from `count - len(new_nodes)`, we need to ensure that `count - len(new_nodes)` is less than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`new_nodes` is a list containing the values of `p` until the loop condition is no longer satisfied; for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`; `index` is `0` or less; `abort` is `True` if `flag` was `-1` at any point during the loop, otherwise `False` if `flag` was `1` at any point; `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]` if the loop did not break due to `index <= 0`; `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)` and `c` must be less than 0**

This ensures that the loop will execute `-c` times, where `-c` is a positive integer.
