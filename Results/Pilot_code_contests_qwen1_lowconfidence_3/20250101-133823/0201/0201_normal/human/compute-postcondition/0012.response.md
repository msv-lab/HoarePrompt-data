Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with specific values at certain indices:
     - `storage[0]` is `lookup[u]`
     - `storage[1]` is `v`
     - `storage[2]` is -1
     - `storage[3]` is either 1 or -1 depending on whether `v == u`
     - `storage[4]` is `u`
   - `storage_index` is 5
   - `n` is an integer representing the number of districts (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6)
   - `k` is an integer representing the number of contestants to be removed (1 ≤ k < n)
   - `edges` is a list of tuples representing roads
   - `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with `lookup[u]` being 1, `lookup[v]` being 3, and all other elements being -1.

2. **For Loop**:
   ```python
   for (u, v) in edges:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Key Variables**:
   - The loop iterates over each edge `(u, v)` in the `edges` list.
   - For each iteration, the variables `u` and `v` change based on the current edge being processed.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has processed one edge `(u, v)`.
   - `storage` will be updated based on the current edge `(u, v)`.
   - `storage_index` will increment by 4 because the loop processes four elements of the `storage` list per iteration.

5. **Updated Values**:
   - `storage[0]` will now be `lookup[u_new]` where `u_new` is the new value of `u` from the next edge.
   - `storage[1]` will now be `v_new` where `v_new` is the new value of `v` from the next edge.
   - `storage[2]` will be -1.
   - `storage[3]` will be either 1 or -1 depending on whether `v_new == u_new`.
   - `storage[4]` will now be `u_new`.

6. **New State**:
   - `storage_index` will be 9 (since it was incremented by 4).

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`storage` is a list of length 4 * n with `storage[0]` being `lookup[u_new]`, `storage[1]` being `v_new`, `storage[2]` being -1, `storage[3] being either 1 or -1 depending on whether `v_new == u_new`, and `storage[4]` being `u_new`; `storage_index` is 9; `n` is an integer representing the number of districts (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6); `k` is an integer representing the number of contestants to be removed (1 ≤ k < n); `edges` is a list of tuples representing roads; `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with `lookup[u]` being 1, `lookup[v]` being 3, and all other elements being -1.**
