The code `nodes[v * 2] = index` updates the value of `nodes` at the index `v * 2` to be `index`. Given the initial state, let's break down the variables:

- `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with the element at index `storage[t + 1] * 2` set to `n`, and all other elements are 0.
- `stack` contains `storage[t + 1], storage[t + 1]`.
- `index` is `n`.
- `t` is `val`.
- `v` is `storage[1]`.
- `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`.
- `stack_append` references the `append` method of `stack`.
- `parent_index` is 0.

The key part here is updating `nodes[v * 2]` to be `index`. Since `index` is `n`, this means `nodes[v * 2]` will now be `n`.

Let's represent the updated `nodes` list:

Given that `nodes` was initially set such that `nodes[storage[t + 1] * 2] = n` and all other elements are 0, the new state will have the same structure but with the additional change at the index `v * 2` being `n`.

So, the output state after executing the code is:

Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with the element at index `storage[t + 1] * 2` set to `n`, the element at index `v * 2` set to `n`, and all other elements are 0; `stack` contains `storage[t + 1], storage[t + 1]`; `index` is `n`; `t` is `val`; `v` is `storage[1]`; `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`; `stack_append` references the `append` method of `stack`; `parent_index` is 0.**
