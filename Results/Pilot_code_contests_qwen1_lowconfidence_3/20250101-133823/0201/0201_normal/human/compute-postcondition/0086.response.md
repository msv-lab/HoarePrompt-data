The code assigns the value of `index` to `nodes[v * 2]`. This means that the value of `nodes[v * 2]` changes to `index`, while the other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `stack` contains `v` (which is `storage[t + 1]`) and possibly other elements, `index` is unchanged, `parent_index` is unchanged, `t` is now `storage[t]`, `v` is now `storage[t + 1]`, and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.**
