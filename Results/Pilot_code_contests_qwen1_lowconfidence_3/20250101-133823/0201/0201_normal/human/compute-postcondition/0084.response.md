The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, in this case, there is no loop present in the given code snippet. The `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The variables `nodes[v * 2]`, `stack`, `index`, `parent_index`, `t`, `v`, and their relationships remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `stack` contains `v` (which is `storage[t + 1]`) and possibly other elements, `index` is unchanged, `parent_index` is unchanged, `t` is now `storage[t]`, `v` is now `storage[t + 1]`, and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.**
