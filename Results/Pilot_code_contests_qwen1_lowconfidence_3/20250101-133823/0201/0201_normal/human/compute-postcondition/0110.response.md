`t` is assigned the value of `storage[t + 1]`. Before this assignment, `v` was equal to `storage[t + 1]`, so now `t` holds the same value as `v`.

The other variables (`nodes`, `v`, and the stack) remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`nodes` has an element at index `v * 2` set to `index`; `v` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`; the stack contains the value `storage[t + 1]` appended to it; `t` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`**
