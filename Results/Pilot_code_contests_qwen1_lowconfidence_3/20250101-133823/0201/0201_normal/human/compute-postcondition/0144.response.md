Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2]`, `p` is `index * 2`, `abort` remains `False` if `flag` is not -1, and `abort` is `True` if `flag` equals -1, and `index` is equal to `nodes[n * 2]`. Additionally, if `flag` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***

This postcondition summarizes the possible outcomes based on the value of `flag`. If `flag` is -1, `abort` becomes `True`. If `flag` is 1, the loop or statement is broken. In all other cases, `abort` remains `False`.
