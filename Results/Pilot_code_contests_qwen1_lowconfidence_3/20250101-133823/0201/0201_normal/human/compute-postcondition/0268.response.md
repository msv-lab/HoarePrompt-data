To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Given Information:
- `new_nodes` is a list containing the values of `p` until the loop condition is no longer satisfied.
- For each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1` except for `new_nodes[j] + 1` which is now `-1`.
- `index` is `0` or less.
- `abort` is `True` if `flag` was `-1` at any point during the loop, otherwise `False` if `flag` was `1` at any point.
- `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]` if the loop did not break due to `index <= 0`.
- `c` is `-c + 1` and `c` must be less than `0`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in xrange(-c):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `c`:**
   - The value of `c` changes as `c` is updated by the operation `c = -c + 1`.
   - Since `c` is initially less than `0`, the first operation `c = -c + 1` will make it positive.
   - Subsequent operations will alternate between positive and negative values, but since we are using `xrange(-c)`, `c` must remain negative for the loop to continue.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `j = -c` to `j = -1` (inclusive).
   - The loop will run exactly `abs(c)` times.

3. **Index and Abort:**
   - `index` is `0` or less.
   - `abort` is determined based on the value of `flag` which is checked when the loop does not break due to `index <= 0`.

### Steps to Determine New States:
1. **Update `c`:**
   - Since `c` must remain negative for the loop to continue, `c` will be updated to `c = -c + 1`.
   - After the update, `c` will be positive, so the loop will stop.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `c` remains negative, which means `c` should be updated to a new negative value before the next iteration.

2. **Update `index`:**
   - `index` is `0` or less. If the loop continues, `index` will increase by 1 after each iteration, so `index` will become `1`.

3. **Update `abort`:**
   - `abort` is `True` if `flag` was `-1` at any point during the loop, otherwise `False` if `flag` was `1` at any point.
   - Since the loop body is omitted, `abort` will remain unchanged unless explicitly modified inside the loop body, which is not the case here.

4. **Update `flag`:**
   - `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]` if the loop did not break due to `index <= 0`.
   - Since the loop does not break due to `index <= 0`, `flag` will remain as the last value it had, which is `nodes[new_nodes[-1] + 1]` (if `new_nodes` is not empty).

### Final State:
- `new_nodes` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.
- `index` increases by 1, so it becomes `1` (or more if there were multiple iterations).
- `abort` remains the same unless explicitly changed inside the loop body.
- `flag` remains the same unless explicitly changed inside the loop body.
- `c` is updated to a new negative value such that the loop can continue.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
```plaintext
State: **new_nodes is a list containing the values of p until the loop condition is no longer satisfied; for each p in new_nodes, nodes[p + 1] is -1 except for new_nodes[j] + 1 which is now -1; index is 1; abort is True if flag was -1 at any point during the loop, otherwise False if flag was 1 at any point; flag is nodes[new_nodes[-1] + 1] if the loop did not break due to index <= 0; c is a new negative value such that abs(c) is one less than the current absolute value of c**
```

This ensures that the loop can execute one more time if `c` is updated to a new negative value.
