The code `v = storage[t + 1]` assigns the value at index `t + 1` in the `storage` list to the variable `v`. The value of `v` is taken from the `storage` list, so `v` is now set to `storage[t + 1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nodes` has an element at index `v * 2` set to `index`; `v` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`; the stack contains the value `storage[t + 1]` appended to it; `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.**
