Output State: **`new_nodes` must be an empty list, `nodes[p + 1]` is equal to `1` for every `p` in `new_nodes`**.

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `p` in `new_nodes` and sets `nodes[p + 1]` to 1.
- Since `new_nodes` contains elements based on the condition `flag == -1` or `index <= 0`, and after the loop runs, `new_nodes` must be empty (as the condition for its creation no longer holds), meaning there are no more elements left to iterate over.
- For every `p` in the original `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is set to 1, and since `new_nodes` is now empty, this assignment no longer occurs.
- Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `new_nodes` must be an empty list, and for every `p` that was originally in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is set to 1.
