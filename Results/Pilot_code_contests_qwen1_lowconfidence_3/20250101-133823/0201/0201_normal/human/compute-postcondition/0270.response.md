Output State: **new_nodes is a list containing the values of `p` until the loop condition is no longer satisfied; for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`; `index` is `0` or less; `abort` is `True` if `flag` was `-1` at any point during the loop, otherwise `False` if `flag` was `1` at any point; `flag` is `nodes[new_nodes[-1] + 1]` if the loop did not break due to `index <= 0`; `c` is `-c - 1` and `c` must be less than `0`**

Explanation:
- **`new_nodes`**: This list remains unchanged throughout the loop because the loop does not modify its contents but only uses the indices within it.
- **`nodes[p + 1]`**: For each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` gets set to `-1`. After the loop completes, every entry in `new_nodes` will result in `nodes[p + 1]` being `-1`.
- **`index`**: This remains `0` or less, indicating that the loop did not break due to this condition.
- **`abort`**: This boolean indicates whether `flag` was `-1` at any point during the loop. If `flag` was `-1` at any time, `abort` is `True`; otherwise, it is `False`.
- **`flag`**: This is updated to `nodes[p + 1]` if the loop did not break due to `index <= 0`. After all iterations, `flag` will be `nodes[new_nodes[-1] + 1]` since `new_nodes` is fully processed.
- **`c`**: Initially, `c` is less than 0, and after each iteration, `c` decreases by 1. After all iterations, `c` will be a negative value that is `-len(new_nodes)` less than its original value.

Since the loop continues until `c` becomes less than 0, `c` will eventually reach a value such that `abs(c)` is one less than the original value of `c`. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `c` will be `-c - 1` and must be less than 0.
