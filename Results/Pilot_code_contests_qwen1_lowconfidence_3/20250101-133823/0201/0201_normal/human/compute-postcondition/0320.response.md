According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p` being in the `new_nodes` list. At the end of the last iteration, `new_nodes` must not be an empty list, `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop breaks, `index` is the last value of `index` before the loop breaks, `abort` is `True`, `flag` is the value of `nodes[index * 2 + k]` where `k` is such that the loop breaks due to `flag == -1` or `flag == 1`, `count` is -1, `i` is `n - 1`, and `nodes[p + 1]` is -1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `p` must be a valid element in `new_nodes`. Since `new_nodes` is non-empty, we know there is at least one element in it. For the loop to continue, `p` should be the next element in `new_nodes`.

Given that `p` is the last value before the loop breaks, we can assume that the next `p` will be the next element in `new_nodes`.

Let's summarize the state adjustments:

- `new_nodes` must not be an empty list (already given).
- `p` is now the next element in `new_nodes`.
- `index` remains the same as it was the last value before the loop breaks.
- `abort` remains `True`.
- `flag` remains the same as it was the last value before the loop breaks.
- `count` remains `-1`.
- `i` remains `n - 1`.
- `nodes[p + 1]` remains `-1`.

State: **`new_nodes` must not be an empty list, `p` is the next element in `new_nodes`, `index` is the last value of `index` before the loop breaks, `abort` is `True`, `flag` is the value of `nodes[index * 2 + k]` where `k` is such that the loop breaks due to `flag == -1` or `flag == 1`, `count` is -1, `i` is `n - 1`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1**
