Postcondition: ***`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `stack` contains `v` and possibly other elements, `index` is unchanged, `parent_index` is unchanged, `t` is now `storage[t]`, `v` is now `storage[t + 1]`, and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0. Since there is no else part in the code, the postcondition remains the same whether the condition `v == parent_index` is true or false.***
