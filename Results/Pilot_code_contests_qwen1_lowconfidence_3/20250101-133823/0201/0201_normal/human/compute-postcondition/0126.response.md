The `break` statement is executed, which does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the execution has exited the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is `n * 2`, `abort` is `True`, `flag` is `-1` and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.**
