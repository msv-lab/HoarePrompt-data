`nodes[p + 1]` is assigned the value `-1`. According to the initial state, `p` is the final value of `index * 2`, and `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`, and `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`. However, since no direct assignment involving `n`, `i`, `new_nodes`, or `abort` is made in this line of code, these variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `nodes[p + 1]` is now `-1`
- `n` remains greater than or equal to 1
- `i` remains equal to `n`
- `new_nodes` remains a list containing at least one element
- `p` remains the final value of `index * 2`
- `abort` remains `True`
- `index` remains the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`
- `flag` remains the value of `nodes[p] + 1`

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing at least one element, `p` is the final value of `index * 2`, `abort` is `True`, `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`, `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1**
