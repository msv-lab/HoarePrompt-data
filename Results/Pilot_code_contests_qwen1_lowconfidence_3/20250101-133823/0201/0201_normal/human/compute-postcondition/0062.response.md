Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while stack:`. This means the loop will continue as long as the `stack` is not empty.

2. **Current State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as just `nodes`. However, we need to consider the context of the `stack` and how it relates to the loop.

3. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the `stack` must still contain at least one element. 
   - Since no specific information about the `stack` is given in the current state, we can assume that the `stack` was not empty at the end of the previous iteration (otherwise, the loop would have terminated).

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to confirm that the `stack` is still non-empty. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure the `stack` is non-empty.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`nodes` and the `stack` must not be empty**
