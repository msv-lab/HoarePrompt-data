The code initializes `new_nodes` as an empty list. This means that the previous value of `new_nodes` is cleared and replaced with an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list; `index` is `0` or less; `abort` is `True` if `flag` was `-1` at any point during the loop, otherwise `False` if `flag` was `1` at any point; `flag` is `nodes[new_nodes[-1] + 1]` if the loop did not break due to `index <= 0` and `c` is `-c - 1` which is less than `0`; `count` is equal to `c` which is `0`; `i` is `n - 1`**
