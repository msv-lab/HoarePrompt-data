The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional statement. In this case, it is exiting the loop or conditional statement that was being checked based on the condition `flag == -1`. However, since there is no loop or conditional statement in the provided code snippet, the only impact is that the execution will exit the current block of code.

Given the initial state, the variables `new_nodes`, `index`, `abort`, `flag`, `count`, and `i` retain their values. The `index` remains less than or equal to 0.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p]`, `index` is `nodes[p]`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on the condition `flag == -1`, `flag` is set to `-1`, `count` retains its value, `i` retains its value, and `index` is less than or equal to 0**
