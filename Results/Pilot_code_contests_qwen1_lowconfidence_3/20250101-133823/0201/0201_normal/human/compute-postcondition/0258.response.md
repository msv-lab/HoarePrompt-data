Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list; for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is 1; `index` is 0 or less; `abort` is `True` if `flag` was `-1` at any point during the loop, otherwise `False` if `flag` was `1` at any point; `flag` is not defined since the loop did not execute; `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`, and `c` is equal to `count`.**

Explanation:
- Since the loop does not execute at all (as per the conditions given), `new_nodes` remains an empty list.
- For each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` will still be `-1` because no assignment to these indices occurred.
- The value of `index` remains unchanged as `0` or less.
- The value of `abort` remains `True` if `flag` was `-1` at any point during the loop, otherwise `False` if `flag` was `1` at any point. Since the loop does not execute, `flag` is never updated, and its previous value dictates the value of `abort`.
- The value of `flag` is not defined since the loop does not execute.
- Since `new_nodes` is an empty list, `len(new_nodes)` is `0`, and thus `c` is equal to `count - 0`, which is `count`.
