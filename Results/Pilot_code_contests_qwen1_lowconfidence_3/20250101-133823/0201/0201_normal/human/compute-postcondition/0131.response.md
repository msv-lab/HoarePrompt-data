Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is `n * 2`, `abort` is `True` if `flag` equals `-1`, otherwise `abort` remains `False`, and `flag` is either `-1` or `nodes[p + 1]` depending on whether it was `-1` initially or not. If `flag` was `-1`, the loop or conditional block is broken; if `flag` was not `-1`, it remains unchanged unless it becomes `1`, in which case the loop or conditional block is also broken.***
