According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `new_nodes`. For the loop to execute again, `new_nodes` must contain at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `new_nodes` must contain at least one element, and `nodes[p + 1]` is equal to `1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `new_nodes` still contains at least one element. Since the loop is iterating over `new_nodes`, and it must have at least one element to enter the loop, the condition for the next iteration remains the same.

State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one element, `nodes[p + 1]` is equal to `1`**
