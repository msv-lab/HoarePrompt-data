The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop in which it appears. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged after executing the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with all elements equal to 0; `stack` is an empty list; `index` is 'n'; `t` is `storage[t + 1]`; `v` is `storage[t + 1]`; `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`; `stack_append` references the `append` method of `stack`; `parent_index` is 0; the current value of `v` is equal to `parent_index`**
