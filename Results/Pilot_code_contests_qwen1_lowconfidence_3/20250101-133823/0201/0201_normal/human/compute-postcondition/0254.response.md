According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `new_nodes`. For the loop to execute again, `new_nodes` must contain at least one value. At the end of the last iteration, `new_nodes` must have contained at least one value, and `nodes[p + 1]` was 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `p` (the current value being iterated over) will be the first element in `new_nodes`. Therefore, `new_nodes` must still contain at least one value, and `nodes[p + 1]` must be defined and hold a value (since `p` will be the first element in `new_nodes`).

State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one value; `nodes[p + 1]` is defined and holds a value**
