The code `index = nodes[p]` updates the value of the variable `index` to be the value of `nodes[p]`. From the initial state, we know that `nodes[p]` is equal to `index`, so updating `index` to `nodes[p]` means `index` remains the same.

Therefore, the values of the other variables (`new_nodes`, `abort`, `flag`, `count`, `i`, `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p, p]`, `index` is `index`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` based on `flag == -1`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`, `count` retains its value, `i` retains its value, `p` is `index * 2`.**
