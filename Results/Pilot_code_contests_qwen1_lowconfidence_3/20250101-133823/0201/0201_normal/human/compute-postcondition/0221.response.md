Postcondition: **`new_nodes` is [p], `count` must be greater than 0, `index` must be less than or equal to 0, `abort` must be either `True` or `False`, and `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`. If `flag` equals -1, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `flag` equals 1, the function also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither condition is met, the postcondition remains as stated initially.**
