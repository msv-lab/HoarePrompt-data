The code `v = storage[t + 1]` assigns the value of `storage[t + 1]` to `v`. Given the initial state, `v` is updated to the value of `storage[t + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `stack` contains `v` (which is `storage[t + 1]`) and possibly other elements, `index` is unchanged, `parent_index` is unchanged, `t` is now `storage[t]`, `v` is now `storage[t + 1]`, and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.**
