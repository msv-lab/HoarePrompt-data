Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. The initial state includes several variables:
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `new_nodes` is a list containing elements `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, ..., nodes[index] * 2]` until the condition `flag == -1` or `index <= 0` is met.
   - `p` is the final value of `index * 2`.
   - `abort` is `True`.
   - `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`.
   - `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`.
   - For every `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`.
   - `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`, and `c` must be less than 0.

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1
   ```

   This line assigns the value `-1` to `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]`.

3. After executing this line of code:
   - `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is now `-1`.
   - All other variables retain their previous values as no other operations are performed on them.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is equal to `n`; `new_nodes` is a list containing elements `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, ..., nodes[index] * 2]` until the condition `flag == -1` or `index <= 0` is met; `p` is the final value of `index * 2`; `abort` is `True`; `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`; `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`; for every `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`; `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)` and `c` must be less than 0; `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1`.**
