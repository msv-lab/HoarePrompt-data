The given initial state does not provide explicit values for `n` and `nodes`. However, the code snippet itself defines `result` based on the values of `n` and `nodes`. Since the initial state does not specify these values, we can infer that `n` and `nodes` are used in the list comprehension to determine the value of `result`.

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `result` is defined as a list comprehension.
2. The list comprehension iterates over `i` from `1` to `n + 1`.
3. For each `i`, it checks if `nodes[i * 2 + 1]` is not equal to `1`.
4. If the condition is true, `i` is added to the list `result`.

Since the actual values of `n` and `nodes` are not specified, we can only express `result` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`result` is a list containing values of `i` (from `1` to `n + 1`) where `nodes[i * 2 + 1]` is not equal to `1`.**
