Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is `[p, p]`, `index` is `index`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` based on `flag == -1`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 2]`, `count` retains its value, `i` retains its value, `p` is `index * 2`. If `flag == -1`, `abort` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `abort` remains unchanged.***
