The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code snippet, the only effect is that we break out of the hypothetical loop or conditional context. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p, p]`, `count` must be greater than 0, `index` is `p`, `abort` is `True`, and `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
