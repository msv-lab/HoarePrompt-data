Output State: **'stack' is empty, `nodes[v * 2]` is `index` for each valid pair, `parent_index` is set such that for each node `v`, `nodes[v * 2]` points to its parent, `t` is -1 indicating no further nodes to process, and the structure of `nodes` represents a binary tree where each node's left child is `nodes[v * 2]` and right child is `nodes[v * 2 + 1]`.**
