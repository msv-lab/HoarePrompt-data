Output State: **`new_nodes` is a list, `index` is the last value of `index` before the loop breaks, `abort` is `True`, `flag` is the value of `nodes[index * 2 + k]` where `k` is such that the loop breaks due to `flag == -1` or `flag == 1`, `count` is `-1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `c` is adjusted so that `-c` is less than or equal to `len(new_nodes)`, and for every `j` in range `-c`, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1`.**
