Postcondition: **`new_nodes` is a list containing the values of `p` until the loop condition is no longer satisfied, `count` is adjusted by subtracting the length of `new_nodes` from its original value, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1` for all `j` in the range of `-c` to `0`, `p` is the last value of `index * 2` computed before the loop exited, `index` is `nodes[p]` and is greater than 0 (since the loop exits when `index <= 0`), `abort` is `True` if `flag` was `-1` at any point during the loop, otherwise `abort` is `False` if `flag` was `1` at any point, and `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]` if the loop did not break due to `index <= 0`, and the condition `abort` is true**
