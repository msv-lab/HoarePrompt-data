Initially, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with `storage[0]` being `lookup[u]`, `storage[1]` being `v`, and `storage[2]` and `storage[3]` being -1. `storage_index` is 3. `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with `lookup[u]` being 1 and all other elements being -1.

Given that `storage_index` is 3, the code `storage[storage_index + 1] = u` updates `storage[4]` (since `storage_index + 1` is 4) to the value of `u`.

The value of `storage[4]` is now `u`. All other elements in the list `storage` and the values of `storage_index`, `n`, `k`, and `edges` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`storage` is a list of length 4 * n with `storage[0]` being `lookup[u]`, `storage[1]` being `v`, `storage[2]` being -1, `storage[3]` being either 1 or -1 depending on whether `v == u`, and `storage[4]` being `u`; `storage_index` is 3; `n` is an integer representing the number of districts (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6); `k` is an integer representing the number of contestants to be removed (1 ≤ k < n); `edges` is a list of tuples representing roads; `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with `lookup[u]` being 1 and all other elements being -1.**
