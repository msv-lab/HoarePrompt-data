The code `nodes[p + 1] = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the index `p + 1` in the `nodes` list. Given that `nodes[p + 1]` was previously `-1`, this assignment does not change its value. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`new_nodes` must not be an empty list, `p` is the next element in `new_nodes`, `index` is the last value of `index` before the loop breaks, `abort` is `True`, `flag` is the value of `nodes[index * 2 + k]` where `k` is such that the loop breaks due to `flag == -1` or `flag == 1`, `count` is -1, `i` is `n - 1`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1**
