The code snippet reads from `sys.stdin` and assigns a list of tuples to `edges`. Each tuple contains two integers representing a road connecting districts. Since the input is read from `sys.stdin`, the exact values of these tuples are not known until runtime. However, we know the structure and the constraints of the variables.

- `n` and `k` remain integers such that `1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^6`.
- `edges` is updated to a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a road connecting districts.

Since the actual values of `edges` depend on the input, we cannot specify them explicitly without knowing the input. But we can describe the structure and constraints clearly.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^6`; `edges` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing a road connecting districts.**
