Output State: **`new_nodes` is [p], `count` is adjusted by subtracting 1 from its original value, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1` for all `j` in the range of `-c` to `0`, `p` is `i * 2`, `index` is `nodes[p]`, `abort` is `True` if `flag` is `-1`; otherwise, `abort` is `False` and `flag` is `1` if it was `nodes[p + 1]` and equals `1`.**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `index` is assigned the value of `nodes[p]`.
2. The values of `new_nodes`, `count`, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` for all `j` in the range of `-c` to `0`, `p`, and `abort` remain unchanged.
3. The value of `flag` is used to determine the value of `abort`: if `flag` is `-1`, `abort` remains `True`; otherwise, `abort` is set to `False` and `flag` is set to `1` if `nodes[p + 1]` equals `1`.

Therefore, the only new variable introduced by the code is `index`, which is set to `nodes[p]`.
