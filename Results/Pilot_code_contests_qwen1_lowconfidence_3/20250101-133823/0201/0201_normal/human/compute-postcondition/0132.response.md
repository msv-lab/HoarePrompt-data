The code `new_nodes.append(p)` appends the value of `p` to the list `new_nodes`. From the initial state, we know that `p` is equal to `n * 2`. Since `new_nodes` is initially an empty list, appending `p` to it will create a new list containing `[p]`.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `abort`, and `flag`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2]`, `p` is `n * 2`, `abort` is `True` if `flag` equals `-1`, otherwise `abort` remains `False`, and `flag` is either `-1` or `nodes[p + 1]` depending on whether it was `-1` initially or not. If `flag` was `-1`, the loop or conditional block is broken; if `flag` was not `-1`, it remains unchanged unless it becomes `1`, in which case the loop or conditional block is also broken.**
