The code assigns `nodes[p + 1]` to `flag`. Given that `p` is `index * 2`, `flag` originally was `nodes[n * 2]`. Now, `flag` is updated to the value of `nodes[p + 1]`, which is `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`.

Here's the updated state:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is equal to `n`
- `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2]`
- `p` is `index * 2`
- `abort` remains `False`
- `flag` is now `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`
- `index` is equal to `nodes[n * 2]`

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2]`, `p` is `index * 2`, `abort` remains `False`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`, and `index` is equal to `nodes[n * 2]`**
