The `continue` statement in the given code does not change the values of any variables. It merely skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop it is within, but no actual changes to variables are made.

Given the initial state:

- `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with the element at index `storage[t + 1] * 2` set to `n`, and all other elements are 0.
- `stack` contains `storage[t + 1], storage[t + 1]`.
- `index` is `n`.
- `t` is `val`.
- `v` is `storage[1]`.
- `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`.
- `stack_append` references the `append` method of `stack`.
- `parent_index` is 0.

Since `continue` does not affect these variables, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with the element at index `storage[t + 1] * 2` set to `n`, and all other elements are 0; `stack` contains `storage[t + 1], storage[t + 1]`; `index` is `n`; `t` is `val`; `v` is `storage[1]`; `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`; `stack_append` references the `append` method of `stack`; `parent_index` is 0.**
