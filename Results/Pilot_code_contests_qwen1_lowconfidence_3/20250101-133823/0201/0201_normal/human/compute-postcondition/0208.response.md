Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is an empty list, `count` is adjusted by subtracting the length of `new_nodes`, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1` for all `j` in the range of `-c` to `0`, `p` is `i * 2`, `abort` is `True` if `flag` is `-1`; otherwise, `abort` is `False` and `flag` is `1` if it was `nodes[p + 1]` and equals `1`.***
