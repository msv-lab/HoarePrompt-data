Let's analyze the given program state and the `while` loop step by step.

### Given Program State
- `nodes` and the `stack` must not be empty.
- `index` is the value popped from the `stack`.
- `parent_index` is the value of `nodes[index * 2]`.
- `t` is the value of `lookup[index]`.

### While Loop Condition
```
while t >= 0:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
For the `while` loop to execute at least once, the condition `t >= 0` must be true when the loop starts.

#### Current State
- The value of `t` is obtained from `lookup[index]`.

### Requirement for the Loop to Execute
- For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be non-negative (i.e., `t >= 0`).

Given that the current value of `t` is obtained from `lookup[index]`, we need to ensure that `t` is not negative. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `t` is non-negative.

### Adjusted State
- `nodes` and the `stack` must not be empty.
- `index` is the value popped from the `stack`.
- `parent_index` is the value of `nodes[index * 2]`.
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.

### Final Answer
State: **`nodes` and the `stack` must not be empty; `index` is the value popped from the `stack`; `parent_index` is the value of `nodes[index * 2]`; `t` must be greater than or equal to 0**
