The code `nodes[v * 2] = index` assigns the value of `index` to the element at the index `v * 2` in the list `nodes`. According to the initial state, `v` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`, and the stack contains the value `storage[t + 1]` appended to it. Also, `t` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`.

Since the condition `if v == parent_index` is not met (there is no `else` part), the values of `v`, `t`, and the stack remain unchanged. Therefore, after executing the code, the updated state is:

- `nodes[v * 2]` is assigned the value of `index`.
- `v` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`.
- `t` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`.
- The stack contains the value `storage[t + 1]` appended to it.

Output State: **`nodes` has an element at index `v * 2` set to `index`; `v` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`; the stack contains the value `storage[t + 1]` appended to it; `t` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`.**
