Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is a list containing the values of `p` until the loop condition is no longer satisfied. For each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`. `index` is `0` or less, `abort` is `True` if `flag` was `-1` at any point during the loop, otherwise `False` if `flag` was `1` at any point, and `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]` if the loop did not break due to `index <= 0`. The program continues with the next statement.***
