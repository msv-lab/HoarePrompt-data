The code `index = nodes[p]` assigns the value of `nodes[p]` to the variable `index`. Given the initial state, `p` is set to `n * 2`. Therefore, `nodes[p]` refers to `nodes[n * 2]`.

The value of `nodes[n * 2]` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, the other variables remain unchanged: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2]`, `p` is `n * 2`, `abort` is `True` if `flag` equals `-1`, otherwise `abort` remains `False`, and `flag` is either `-1` or `nodes[p + 1]` depending on whether it was `-1` initially or not.

Since the value of `nodes[n * 2]` is not specified, we denote it as `nodes[n * 2]`. Therefore, `index` is assigned the value `nodes[n * 2]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2]`, `p` is `n * 2`, `abort` is `True` if `flag` equals `-1`, otherwise `abort` remains `False`, `flag` is either `-1` or `nodes[p + 1]` depending on whether it was `-1` initially or not, and `index` is equal to `nodes[n * 2]`.**
