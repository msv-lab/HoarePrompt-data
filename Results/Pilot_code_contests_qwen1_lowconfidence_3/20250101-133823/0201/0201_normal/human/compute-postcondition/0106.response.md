`nodes[v * 2]` is assigned the value `index`. Here, `v` is the value at index `t + 1` in the `storage` list, and `t` is the value at index `t` in `storage`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. The Output State is: `nodes` is updated such that the element at index `v * 2` is set to `index`; `v` is the value at index `t + 1` in the `storage` list; `storage` is a list; `t` is now the value at index `t` in `storage`.

Output State: **`nodes` is updated such that the element at index `v * 2` is set to `index`; `v` is the value at index `t + 1` in the `storage` list; `storage` is a list; `t` is now the value at index `t` in `storage`.**
