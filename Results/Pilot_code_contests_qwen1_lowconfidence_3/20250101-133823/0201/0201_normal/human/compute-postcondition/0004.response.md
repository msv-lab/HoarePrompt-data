The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`. 

- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^6, representing the number of districts and the number of contestants to remove, respectively.
- `edges` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `a` and `b` representing a road connecting districts `a` and `b`.

The function does not return anything directly mentioned in the provided information. Based on the given context, it seems the function might process the input parameters and possibly modify or analyze the structure defined by `n`, `k`, and `edges`. However, since no specific return value is provided, we can only describe the parameters accepted.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer), `k` (an integer), and `edges` (a list of tuples), where `n` and `k` satisfy the condition 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^6, and `edges` represent connections between districts.**
