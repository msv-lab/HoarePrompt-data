The code `p = i * 2` assigns the value of `i * 2` to the variable `p`. Given the initial state:

- `new_nodes` is an empty list
- `index` is `0` or less
- `abort` is `True` if `flag` was `-1` at any point during the loop, otherwise `False` if `flag` was `1` at any point
- `flag` is `nodes[new_nodes[-1] + 1]` if the loop did not break due to `index <= 0` and `c` is `-c - 1` which is less than `0`
- `count` is equal to `c` which is `0`
- `i` is `n - 1`

Since the initial value of `i` is `n - 1`, the calculation `p = i * 2` results in `p = (n - 1) * 2`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `index` is 0 or less, `abort` is True if `flag` was -1 at any point during the loop, otherwise False if `flag` was 1 at any point, `flag` is `nodes[new_nodes[-1] + 1]` if the loop did not break due to `index <= 0`, `c` is -1, `count` is -1, `i` is `n - 1`, `p` is `(n - 1) * 2`**
