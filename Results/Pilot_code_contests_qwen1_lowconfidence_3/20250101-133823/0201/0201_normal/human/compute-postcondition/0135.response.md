The code `break` is executed, which breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement. However, since no loop or conditional statement is specified in the given code snippet, the only impact is that the program exits the current loop or conditional block. The values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
**`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2]`, `p` is `n * 2`, `abort` remains `False` since `flag` does not equal `-1`, `flag` is `nodes[n * 2]` since it was not `-1` initially, and `index` is equal to `nodes[n * 2]`. The current value of `index` is less than or equal to 0.**
