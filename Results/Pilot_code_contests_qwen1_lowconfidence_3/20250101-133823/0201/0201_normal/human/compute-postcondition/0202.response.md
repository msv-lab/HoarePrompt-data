The code `abort = True` assigns the value `True` to the variable `abort`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `count` is adjusted by subtracting the length of `new_nodes`, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1` for all `j` in the range of `-c` to `0`, `p` is `i * 2`, `abort` is `True`, `flag` is `-1**
