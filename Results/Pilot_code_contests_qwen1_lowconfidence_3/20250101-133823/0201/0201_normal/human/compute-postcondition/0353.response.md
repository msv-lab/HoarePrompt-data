Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of districts, an integer `k` representing the number of contestants to be removed, and a list of tuples `edges` representing the bidirectional roads between districts. It constructs a binary tree representation of the graph using the given edges and then removes `k` contestants (districts) by marking their nodes in the tree. The function ensures that the remaining nodes form a valid binary tree structure and outputs the indices of the nodes that are not marked for removal.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function should handle this case appropriately, potentially returning an empty list since all districts would be removed.
- The function assumes that `n` and `k` are within the specified ranges (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k < n). However, it does not explicitly check these conditions, which could lead to errors if invalid inputs are provided.
- The function does not handle the case where the input graph (edges) is not connected or has multiple components. In such cases, the behavior of the function is undefined.
- The function does not provide any error handling for the input types. It should validate that `n` and `k` are integers and `edges` is a list of tuples.
