Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is a list containing values of `p` obtained during each iteration until the loop breaks, `index` is the last value of `index` before the loop breaks, `abort` is `True`, `flag` is the value of `nodes[index * 2 + k]` where `k` is such that the loop breaks due to `flag == -1` or `flag == 1`, `count` is -1, `i` is `n - 1`. For each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1.***
