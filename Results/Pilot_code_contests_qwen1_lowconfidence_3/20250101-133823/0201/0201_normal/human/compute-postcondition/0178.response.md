`nodes[p + 1]` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `p` is the first element in `new_nodes`, and since `new_nodes` contains at least one element, `p` is defined. The value of `nodes[p + 1]` is now `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one element, `nodes[p + 1]` is equal to `1`**
