The code assigns `index * 2` to `p`. Given the initial state, `index` is less than or equal to 0, so `index * 2` will also be less than or equal to 0. This means `p` will be a non-positive integer. Since no other variables are affected, the output state includes the updated value of `p`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2]`, `p` is `index * 2`, `abort` remains `False`, `flag` is `nodes[n * 2]`, and `index` is equal to `nodes[n * 2]`.**
