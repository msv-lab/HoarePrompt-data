The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead exits the loop or block it is within. Given the initial state, the only changes are that we exit the loop or block where this statement is located. The variables `new_nodes`, `index`, `abort`, `flag`, `count`, `i`, and `p` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p, p, p]`, `index` is `index` if `flag == -1` else `nodes[index * 2]`, `abort` is `True` if `flag == -1` else `False`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 2]`, `count` retains its value, `i` retains its value, `p` is `index * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
