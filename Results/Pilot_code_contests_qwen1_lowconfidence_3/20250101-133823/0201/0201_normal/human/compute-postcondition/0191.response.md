Let's break down the problem step by step to understand how the states should be modified for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is `n`
- `new_nodes` is a list containing elements `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, ..., nodes[index] * 2]` until the condition `flag == -1` or `index <= 0` is met
- `p` is the final value of `index * 2`
- `abort` is `True`
- `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`
- `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`
- For every `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`
- `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)` and `c` must be less than 0
- `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1`

### Loop to Consider:
```
for j in xrange(-c):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = -c` to `j = -1` (since `xrange` generates values from start to stop-1).
2. **Initial Values**: At the start of the loop, `j` is `-c`.

3. **First Iteration**:
   - The first iteration of the loop will run when `j` is `-c`.
   - After the first iteration, `j` will become `-c - 1`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `j` is initially `-c` and it will decrement by 1 for each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `-c - 1`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be `-c - 1`.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `n`, `i`, `new_nodes`, `p`, `abort`, `index`, `flag`, and `nodes` remain unchanged since the loop does not directly modify these variables.
   - `c` remains the same since it is calculated once before the loop starts.
   - `count` and `nodes`'s specific indices may change inside the loop body but are not specified here, so we assume they stay the same.

### Final State for the Next Iteration:

- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is `n`
- `new_nodes` is a list containing elements `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, ..., nodes[index] * 2]` until the condition `flag == -1` or `index <= 0` is met
- `p` is the final value of `index * 2`
- `abort` is `True`
- `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`
- `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`
- For every `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`
- `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)` and `c` must be less than 0
- `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1`
- **`j` is `-c - 1`**

### Answer:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing elements `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, ..., nodes[index] * 2]` until the condition `flag == -1` or `index <= 0` is met, `p` is the final value of `index * 2`, `abort` is `True`, `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`, `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`, for every `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`, `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)` and `c` must be less than 0, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1, `j` is `-c - 1`**
