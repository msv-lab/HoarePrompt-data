`storage_index` is incremented by 2. The initial value of `storage_index` is not specified, but it does not affect the calculation since we only need to know it was incremented by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage[0]` is `lookup[u_new]`, `storage[1]` is `v_new`, `storage[2]` is -1, `storage[3]` is 1 or -1 depending on whether `v_new == u_new`, `storage[4]` is `u_new`, `storage[9]` is 1 or 3, `storage[10]` is `v_new`, `storage_index` is increased by 2**
