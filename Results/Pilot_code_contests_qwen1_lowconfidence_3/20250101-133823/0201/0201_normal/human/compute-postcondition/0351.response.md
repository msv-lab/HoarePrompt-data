The code snippet prints the elements of the `result` list, which contains values of `i` (from `1` to `n + 1`) where `nodes[i * 2 + 1]` is not equal to `1`. However, the code itself does not change the values of any variables; it only prints them. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`result` is a list containing values of `i` (from `1` to `n + 1`) where `nodes[i * 2 + 1]` is not equal to `1`.**
