`storage[storage_index]` is assigned the value of `lookup[v]`. Given that `storage_index` is increased by 2 in the previous line, its current value is the last index it was set to plus 2. From the initial state, we know `storage[4]` is `u_new`, `storage[10]` is `v_new`, and `storage[9]` is either 1 or 3. However, since `storage_index` is increased by 2, the exact value of `storage_index` isn't needed to determine the updated storage values.

- `storage[2]` remains `-1`.
- `storage[3]` remains `1` or `-1` depending on whether `v_new == u_new`.
- `storage[4]` remains `u_new`.
- `storage[9]` remains `1` or `3`.
- `storage[10]` remains `v_new`.

Since `storage_index` is increased by 2, the new value for `storage[storage_index]` (which is now `storage[storage_index + 2]`) is set to `lookup[v]`.

Output State: **`storage[0]` is `lookup[u_new]`, `storage[1]` is `v_new`, `storage[2]` is `-1`, `storage[3]` is `1` or `-1` depending on whether `v_new == u_new`, `storage[4]` is `u_new`, `storage[9]` is `1` or `3`, `storage[10]` is `v_new`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is `lookup[v]`**
