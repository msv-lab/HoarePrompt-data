The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop context given, the `continue` statement does not change any variable values or affect the state of the variables outside of the loop. The variables `nodes`, `stack`, `index`, `parent_index`, `t`, and `v` retain their original values after the `continue` statement is executed.

Output State: **`nodes` and the `stack` must not be empty; `index` is the value popped from the `stack`; `parent_index` is the value of `nodes[index * 2]`; `t` is now equal to `storage[t]`; `v` is `storage[t + 1]`; `v` is equal to `parent_index`**
