Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is an empty list, `count` is adjusted by subtracting the length of `new_nodes`, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1` for all `j` in the range of `-c` to `0`, `p` is `i * 2`, `abort` is `False`. If `flag` is equal to 1, then the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
