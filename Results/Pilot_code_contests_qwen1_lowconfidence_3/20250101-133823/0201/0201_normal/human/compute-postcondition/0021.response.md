Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over `edges`, where each edge is a tuple `(u, v)`. Therefore, the loop condition depends on the values of `u` and `v`.

2. **Current State After Previous Iteration**:
   - `storage[0] = lookup[u_new]`
   - `storage[1] = v_new`
   - `storage[2] = -1`
   - `storage[3] = 1` or `-1` depending on whether `v_new == u_new`
   - `storage[4] = u_new`
   - `storage[9] = 1` or `3`
   - `storage[10] = v_new`
   - `storage_index` is increased by 2
   - `storage[storage_index + 1] = u_new`
   - `storage[storage_index + 2] = lookup[v]`
   - `lookup[v] = storage_index`

3. **Determine What Changes Occur in Each Iteration**:
   - `storage_index` is incremented by 2.
   - `storage[storage_index + 1] = u_new`
   - `storage[storage_index + 2] = lookup[v]`
   - `lookup[v] = storage_index`

4. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more edges to process.

5. **Next Iteration State**:
   - Since `storage_index` was increased by 2, it means we are processing the next pair of `u` and `v`.
   - `storage[0]` remains `lookup[u_new]`.
   - `storage[1]` remains `v_new`.
   - `storage[2]` remains `-1`.
   - `storage[3]` remains `1` or `-1` depending on whether `v_new == u_new`.
   - `storage[4]` remains `u_new`.
   - `storage[9]` remains `1` or `3`.
   - `storage[10]` remains `v_new`.
   - `storage_index` is now `previous_storage_index + 2`.
   - `storage[storage_index + 1] = u_new` (new value of `u`).
   - `storage[storage_index + 2] = lookup[v]` (new value of `v`).
   - `lookup[v]` is updated to `storage_index`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`storage[0]` is `lookup[u_new]`, `storage[1]` is `v_new`, `storage[2]` is `-1`, `storage[3]` is `1` or `-1` depending on whether `v_new == u_new`, `storage[4]` is `u_new`, `storage[9]` is `1` or `3`, `storage[10]` is `v_new`, `storage_index` is increased by 2, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u_new`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is `lookup[v]`, `lookup[v]` is `storage_index`**.

However, to simplify this, we can reformat it to focus on the changes:

State: **`storage[0]` is `lookup[u_new]`, `storage[1]` is `v_new`, `storage[2]` is `-1`, `storage[3]` is `1` or `-1` depending on whether `v_new == u_new`, `storage[4]` is `u_new`, `storage[9]` is `1` or `3`, `storage[10]` is `v_new`, `storage_index` is increased by 2, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u_new`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is `lookup[v]`, `lookup[v]` is `storage_index`**.
