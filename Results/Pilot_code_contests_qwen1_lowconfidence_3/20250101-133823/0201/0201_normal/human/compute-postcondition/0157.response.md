`new_nodes` is a list that originally contains `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2]`. The code appends `p` to this list. Since `p` is defined as `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2] * 2`, we add this value to `new_nodes`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2] * 2]`, `p` is `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2] * 2`, `abort` is `True` if `flag` equals -1 and `False` otherwise, `index` is equal to `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2]`, and `flag` is `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2] * 2 + 1`.**
