Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `new_nodes` is a list containing elements \([n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, ..., nodes[index] * 2]\) until the condition `flag == -1` or `index \leq 0` is met.
   - `p` is the final value of `index * 2`.
   - `abort` is `True`.
   - `index` is the last value assigned to `index` which is `nodes[p]`.
   - `flag` is the value of `nodes[p] + 1`.
   - For every `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`.
   - `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`.
   - `c` is greater than or equal to 0.

2. **For Loop**:
   ```python
   for p in new_nodes:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `new_nodes`.
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `new_nodes`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - The key variable here is `new_nodes`. The loop will only execute if `new_nodes` is non-empty.
   - We need to ensure that `new_nodes` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the initial conditions, we need to adjust the state to ensure `new_nodes` is non-empty.

Therefore, the modified state needed for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one element**. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `p`, `abort`, `index`, `flag`, `c`) can remain as stated.
