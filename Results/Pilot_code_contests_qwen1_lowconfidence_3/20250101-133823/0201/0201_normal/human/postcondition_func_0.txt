The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of districts, an integer `k` representing the number of contestants to be removed, and a list of tuples `edges` representing the bidirectional roads between districts. It constructs a binary tree representation of the graph using the given edges and then removes `k` contestants (districts) by marking their nodes in the tree. The function ensures that the remaining nodes form a valid binary tree structure and outputs the indices of the nodes that are not marked for removal.
