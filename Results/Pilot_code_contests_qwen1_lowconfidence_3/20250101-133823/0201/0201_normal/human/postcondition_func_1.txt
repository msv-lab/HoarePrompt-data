The function `func_2()` reads input values for the number of districts `n`, the number of contestants to remove `k`, and a list of edges connecting districts from standard input. It then calls another function `func_1(n, k, edges)` with these parameters. After executing `func_1`, the function does not return any value but ensures that the program state includes the processed `n`, `k`, and `edges`. However, it does not specify what actions `func_1` performs, which could involve removing certain contestants or adjusting the connectivity between districts. Since the code does not provide any further details about the state after `func_1` is called, the final state of the program will depend on the actions taken within `func_1`. Potential edge cases include invalid inputs for `n` and `k`, such as when `k` is non-positive or `k` is not less than `n`, or when `edges` do not form a valid graph structure.
