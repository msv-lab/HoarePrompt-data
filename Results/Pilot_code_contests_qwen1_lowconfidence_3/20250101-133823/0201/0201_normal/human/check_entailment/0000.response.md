Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not seem to solve the given problem correctly. The function `func_1` and `func_2` do not appear to implement the logic required to maximize the total number of fans while ensuring the remaining contestants are connected.

Here's why the program does not meet the requirements:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Removing Contestants**: The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` does not seem to properly handle the requirement to maximize the total number of fans while ensuring the remaining contestants are connected. The function `func_1` attempts to traverse the tree structure but does not clearly account for the fan counts or the connectivity constraint.

2. **Fan Count Calculation**: The fan count for each district is `2^i`, but the program does not seem to consider this fan count in its decision-making process. Instead, it seems to focus on the connectivity of the graph, which is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly.

3. **Potential Test Case**: Consider the following input:
   ```
   6 3
   2 1
   2 6
   4 2
   5 6
   2 3
   ```
   The expected output is `1 3 4`. However, the provided program does not produce the correct output. For instance, if we run the provided program with the above input, it may not produce the expected result because it does not correctly handle the fan count and connectivity constraints.

Since the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described, it is deemed incorrect.
