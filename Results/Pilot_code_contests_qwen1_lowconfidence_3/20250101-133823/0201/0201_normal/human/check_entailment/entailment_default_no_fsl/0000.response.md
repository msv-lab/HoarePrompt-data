Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` attempts to construct a binary tree representation of the graph and then removes `k` contestants by marking nodes in this tree. However, the logic for determining which nodes to mark for removal and ensuring that the remaining nodes form a valid binary tree structure is flawed.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Binary Tree Construction**: The function `func_1` constructs a binary tree representation of the graph, but it does not handle the case where multiple paths exist between nodes, which is allowed in the problem statement.
2. **Incorrect Node Marking**: The logic for marking nodes to be removed does not guarantee that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree with the maximum number of fans.
3. **Potential Overlooked Cases**: The function does not handle cases where the graph is not a simple tree but a more complex structure, which can occur due to the nature of the problem constraints.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
6 3
2 1
2 6
4 2
5 6
2 3
```

The correct output should be:
```
1 3 4
```

However, the provided code may fail to produce the correct output because it does not properly handle the removal of nodes to maximize the number of fans while ensuring connectivity among the remaining nodes.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
