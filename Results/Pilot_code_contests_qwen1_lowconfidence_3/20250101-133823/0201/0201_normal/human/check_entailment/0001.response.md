Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` and its logic do not properly handle the requirement to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants while ensuring all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
6 3
2 1
2 6
4 2
5 6
2 3
```

#### Expected Output:
The expected output should be the removal of contestants from districts such that the remaining contestants have the maximum total number of fans while ensuring all remaining contestants are connected. According to the problem statement, the optimal solution would be to remove contestants from districts 1, 3, and 4, resulting in the following fan count:
- District 2: \(2^2 = 4\)
- District 5: \(2^5 = 32\)
- District 6: \(2^6 = 64\)

Thus, the expected output is:
```
1 3 4
```

#### Actual Output:
However, running the provided program with this input results in an incorrect output. The program does not produce the expected output, indicating a logical error in the implementation.

### Reasoning:
The provided program uses a series of complex operations to manipulate a storage array and a nodes array, but these operations do not align with the problem's requirements. The core logic for selecting which contestants to remove and ensuring connectivity while maximizing fan count is not correctly implemented.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, and hence, the correctness is **False**.
