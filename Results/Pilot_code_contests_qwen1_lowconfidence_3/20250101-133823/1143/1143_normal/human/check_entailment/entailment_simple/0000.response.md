Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Problem Description Understanding**:
   - We need to find the minimum possible total cost for the frog to jump from Stone 1 to Stone N.
   - At each step, the frog can jump to any of the next K stones.
   - The cost of jumping to a stone is the absolute difference in height between the current stone and the destination stone.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads input values for `N` and `K`.
   - It then reads the heights of the stones into a list `arr`.
   - A dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` is initialized to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each stone.
   - The DP array is filled iteratively, ensuring that the minimum cost to reach each stone is calculated based on the minimum costs of previous stones.

3. **Dynamic Programming Implementation**:
   - The outer loop iterates over each stone from 1 to N.
   - The inner loop considers jumps from the current stone to the next K stones.
   - For each possible jump, the cost is computed as the absolute difference in heights.
   - The DP array is updated to store the minimum cost found so far.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The final value in the DP array (`dp[-1]`) represents the minimum cost to reach Stone N, which is printed.

### Detailed Verification:
- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values for `N`, `K`, and the heights of the stones.
- **DP Array Initialization**: The `dp` array is properly initialized to `-1` for all positions except `dp[0]`, which is set to `0` (indicating no cost to start from Stone 1).
- **DP Calculation**: The nested loops correctly update the `dp` array to reflect the minimum costs of reaching each stone.
- **Output**: The final output is the minimum cost to reach Stone N, as required.

Since the program correctly follows the problem description, handles all constraints, and produces the expected output, the program is correct. Therefore, the answer is:

**Correctness: True**
