You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are N stones, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N. For each i (1 \leq i \leq N), the height of Stone i is h_i.

There is a frog who is initially on Stone 1. He will repeat the following action some number of times to reach Stone N:

* If the frog is currently on Stone i, jump to one of the following: Stone i + 1, i + 2, \ldots, i + K. Here, a cost of |h_i - h_j| is incurred, where j is the stone to land on.



Find the minimum possible total cost incurred before the frog reaches Stone N.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq K \leq 100
* 1 \leq h_i \leq 10^4

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
h_1 h_2 \ldots h_N


Output

Print the minimum possible total cost incurred.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

inp = sys.stdin.readline
read = lambda : list(map(int, inp().strip().split()))
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of stones, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, and arr is a list of integers representing the heights of the stones (h_1, h_2, ..., h_n) where 1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^4.
def func_1():
    n, k = read()
    arr = read()
    dp = [-1] * n
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            if i - j > -1:
                tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])
                if dp[i] == -1:
                    dp[i] = tem
                elif dp[i] > tem:
                    dp[i] = tem
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 and \(k \leq n\), `arr` is a list updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` except `dp[0]` which is `0`. After all iterations of the loop, for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to reach index `i` starting from index `0`, where the cost is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `arr` up to the current index `i`. If `i - j` is not greater than -1, the value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged. If the loop does not execute at all, `dp` remains a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`).
    print(dp[-1])

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of zeros with a length of 10^7.
def func_2():
    l = [0] * 10 ** 7

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not use any of the variables from the main problem description. Instead, it initializes a list `l` of zeros with a length of 10^7. This suggests that there might be another function or part of the solution that uses this list to store intermediate results or costs, but no such usage is shown here.
def func_3():
    l = [(0) for i in range(10 ** 7)]


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
