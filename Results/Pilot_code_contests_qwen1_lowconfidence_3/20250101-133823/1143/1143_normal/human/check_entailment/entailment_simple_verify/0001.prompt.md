You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N stones, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N. For each i (1 \leq i \leq N), the height of Stone i is h_i.

There is a frog who is initially on Stone 1. He will repeat the following action some number of times to reach Stone N:

* If the frog is currently on Stone i, jump to one of the following: Stone i + 1, i + 2, \ldots, i + K. Here, a cost of |h_i - h_j| is incurred, where j is the stone to land on.



Find the minimum possible total cost incurred before the frog reaches Stone N.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq K \leq 100
* 1 \leq h_i \leq 10^4

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

                tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])
                if dp[i] == -1:
                    dp[i] = tem
                elif dp[i] > tem:
                    dp[i] = tem
    print(dp[-1])

```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided has incomplete and incorrect implementations of helper functions (`func_2` and `func_3`) which do not contribute to solving the given problem. The main function (`func_1`) seems to be partially correct but lacks handling for boundary conditions and does not correctly implement the dynamic programming solution.

The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` initializes `dp[0]` to 0 and then iterates through each stone, updating the minimum cost to reach each stone from the previous stones within the range `[i-j, i]`. However, the loop to update `dp[i]` only considers jumps from the previous stone, which is incorrect because the problem allows jumping to any of the next `K` stones. Additionally, the initialization of `dp` with `-1` indicates that it is not properly reset or handled for cases where no valid jump exists.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def min_cost_to_reach_stone(n, k, heights):
    dp = [float('inf')] * n
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(max(0, i-k), i):
            if j < n:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + abs(heights[i] - heights[j]))
    return dp[n-1]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    (n, k) = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    heights = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    print(min_cost_to_reach_stone(n, k, heights))
```

This corrected version ensures that the dynamic programming table `dp` is properly initialized and updated, and it correctly handles the range of jumps allowed.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

inp = sys.stdin.readline
read = lambda : list(map(int, inp().strip().split()))
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of stones, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, and arr is a list of integers representing the heights of the stones (h_1, h_2, ..., h_n) where 1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^4.
def func_1():
    n, k = read()
    arr = read()
    dp = [-1] * n
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            if i - j > -1:
                tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])
                if dp[i] == -1:
                    dp[i] = tem
                elif dp[i] > tem:
                    dp[i] = tem
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 and \(k \leq n\), `arr` is a list updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` except `dp[0]` which is `0`. After all iterations of the loop, for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to reach index `i` starting from index `0`, where the cost is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `arr` up to the current index `i`. If `i - j` is not greater than -1, the value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged. If the loop does not execute at all, `dp` remains a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`).
    print(dp[-1])

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of zeros with a length of 10^7.
def func_2():
    l = [0] * 10 ** 7

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not use any of the variables from the main problem description. Instead, it initializes a list `l` of zeros with a length of 10^7. This suggests that there might be another function or part of the solution that uses this list to store intermediate results or costs, but no such usage is shown here.
def func_3():
    l = [(0) for i in range(10 ** 7)]



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
