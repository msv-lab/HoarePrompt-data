Final: **False**

Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The main function `func_1` initializes the dynamic programming array `dp` incorrectly. Specifically, it sets `dp[i]` to `-1` for all `i`, which is problematic because `dp[i]` should initially represent the cost to reach stone `i`, and setting it to `-1` implies that no cost has been computed yet. The subsequent logic updates `dp[i]` based on the minimum cost from previous stones, but this initial setup is flawed.

Moreover, the nested loop structure only considers jumps from the previous stone, which is incorrect according to the problem statement that allows jumping to any of the next `K` stones. The annotated version clarifies this issue and supports the original assessment. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the dynamic programming solution required by the problem.
