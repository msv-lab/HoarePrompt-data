Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible total cost incurred by the frog to jump from Stone 1 to Stone N. The dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` ensures that the minimum cost to reach each stone is calculated by considering all possible jumps up to `K` stones away. The code handles all potential cases within the given constraints, and the output hints confirm that the function `func_1` is correctly implemented according to the problem description. There are no examples or cases where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
