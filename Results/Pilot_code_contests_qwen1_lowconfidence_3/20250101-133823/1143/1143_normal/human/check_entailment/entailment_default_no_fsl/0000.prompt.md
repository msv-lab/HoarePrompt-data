You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N stones, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N. For each i (1 \leq i \leq N), the height of Stone i is h_i.

There is a frog who is initially on Stone 1. He will repeat the following action some number of times to reach Stone N:

* If the frog is currently on Stone i, jump to one of the following: Stone i + 1, i + 2, \ldots, i + K. Here, a cost of |h_i - h_j| is incurred, where j is the stone to land on.



Find the minimum possible total cost incurred before the frog reaches Stone N.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq K \leq 100
* 1 \leq h_i \leq 10^4

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
h_1 h_2 \ldots h_N


Output

Print the minimum possible total cost incurred.

Functions with output description for each function:
import sys

inp = sys.stdin.readline
read = lambda : list(map(int, inp().strip().split()))
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    (n, k) = read()
    arr = read()
    dp = [-1] * n
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            if i - j > -1:
                tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])
                if dp[i] == -1:
                    dp[i] = tem
                elif dp[i] > tem:
                    dp[i] = tem
    print(dp[-1])
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of stones), `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100), and `arr` (a list of integers representing the heights of the stones). It calculates the minimum cost to jump from the first stone to the last stone, where each jump can be up to `k` stones away. The cost of a jump is the absolute difference in height between the two stones. The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to reach the `i-th` stone from the first stone. The function iterates through the stones, updating `dp[i]` with the minimum cost to reach each stone. Finally, the function prints the minimum cost to reach the last stone (`dp[-1]`).
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    l = [0] * 10 ** 7
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2()` takes a list `l` as input, which is initially a list of one million zeros. The function does not modify the list `l` in any way and simply returns the same list `l`. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities since the list remains unchanged throughout the function execution.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    l = [0 for i in range(10 ** 7)]
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  This function initializes a list `l` containing \(10^7\) elements, each set to zero. There are no inputs accepted by the function, and it does not return anything. The function does not perform any additional operations on the list beyond initialization. Therefore, after the function concludes, the state of the program includes a global list `l` with \(10^7\) elements, all initialized to zero. No other variables or states are affected by this function.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
