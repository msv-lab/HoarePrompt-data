Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided only contains `func_1`, which attempts to solve the problem of finding the minimum possible total cost for the frog to jump from Stone 1 to Stone N. However, `func_2` and `func_3` are also included in the code, which are not relevant to solving the problem and do not affect the correctness of `func_1`.

The main issue lies in `func_1` itself. While the logic seems correct at first glance, there is a potential issue with the loop condition. The inner loop should iterate up to `min(n, i + k + 1)` to avoid accessing out-of-bound indices in the `dp` array. The current implementation could potentially access `dp[n]` if `i + k` exceeds `n-1`.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = read()
    arr = read()
    dp = [-1] * n
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(1, min(k + 1, n - i)):
            if dp[i] != -1:
                tem = dp[i] + abs(arr[i] - arr[i + j])
                if dp[i + j] == -1:
                    dp[i + j] = tem
                elif dp[i + j] > tem:
                    dp[i + j] = tem
    print(dp[-1])
```

With this correction, the code should work for every potential case as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original code as provided is **incorrect** due to the potential out-of-bound index access.
