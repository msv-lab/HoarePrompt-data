Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Initialization**: The code correctly reads the number of stones (`n`) and the jump limit (`k`). It also reads the heights of the stones into the list `arr`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization**: The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized to `-1` for all indices except `dp[0]`, which is set to `0`. This indicates that the initial cost to reach the first stone is zero.

3. **Dynamic Programming Update**: The nested loops update the `dp` array such that `dp[i]` stores the minimum cost to reach the `i-th` stone. The outer loop iterates over each stone, and the inner loop considers jumps of lengths from `1` to `k`.

4. **Cost Calculation**: For each stone `i`, the code updates `dp[i]` with the minimum cost calculated from previous stones within the allowed jump distance.

5. **Final Output**: The code correctly prints the value of `dp[-1]`, which represents the minimum cost to reach the last stone.

The annotations provide a good summary of the state transitions and confirm that the code follows the problem description accurately. The function `func_2` and `func_3` do not affect the main functionality and are irrelevant to the problem at hand.

Since the code correctly implements the logic for finding the minimum cost to reach the last stone, and the annotations support this implementation, the code is correct for every potential case as described in the problem statement.
