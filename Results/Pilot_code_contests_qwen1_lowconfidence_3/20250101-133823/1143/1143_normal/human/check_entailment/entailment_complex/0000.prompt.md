You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N stones, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N. For each i (1 \leq i \leq N), the height of Stone i is h_i.

There is a frog who is initially on Stone 1. He will repeat the following action some number of times to reach Stone N:

* If the frog is currently on Stone i, jump to one of the following: Stone i + 1, i + 2, \ldots, i + K. Here, a cost of |h_i - h_j| is incurred, where j is the stone to land on.



Find the minimum possible total cost incurred before the frog reaches Stone N.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq K \leq 100
* 1 \leq h_i \leq 10^4

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
h_1 h_2 \ldots h_N


Output

Print the minimum possible total cost incurred.

Annotated Functions:
import sys

inp = sys.stdin.readline
read = lambda : list(map(int, inp().strip().split()))
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of stones, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, and arr is a list of integers representing the heights of the stones (h_1, h_2, ..., h_n) where 1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^4.
def func_1():
    n, k = read()
    arr = read()
    dp = [-1] * n
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            if i - j > -1:
                tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])
                if dp[i] == -1:
                    dp[i] = tem
                elif dp[i] > tem:
                    dp[i] = tem
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 and \(k \leq n\), `arr` is a list updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` except `dp[0]` which is `0`. After all iterations of the loop, for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to reach index `i` starting from index `0`, where the cost is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `arr` up to the current index `i`. If `i - j` is not greater than -1, the value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged. If the loop does not execute at all, `dp` remains a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`).
    print(dp[-1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of stones), `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100), and `arr` (a list of integers representing the heights of the stones). It calculates the minimum cost to jump from the first stone to the last stone, where each jump can be up to `k` stones away. The cost of a jump is the absolute difference in height between the two stones. The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to reach the `i-th` stone from the first stone. The function iterates through the stones, updating `dp[i]` with the minimum cost to reach each stone. Finally, the function prints the minimum cost to reach the last stone (`dp[-1]`).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of zeros with a length of 10^7.
def func_2():
    l = [0] * 10 ** 7
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` takes a list `l` as input, which is initially a list of one million zeros. The function does not modify the list `l` in any way and simply returns the same list `l`. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities since the list remains unchanged throughout the function execution.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not use any of the variables from the main problem description. Instead, it initializes a list `l` of zeros with a length of 10^7. This suggests that there might be another function or part of the solution that uses this list to store intermediate results or costs, but no such usage is shown here.
def func_3():
    l = [(0) for i in range(10 ** 7)]
#Overall this is what the function does:This function initializes a list `l` containing \(10^7\) elements, each set to zero. There are no inputs accepted by the function, and it does not return anything. The function does not perform any additional operations on the list beyond initialization. Therefore, after the function concludes, the state of the program includes a global list `l` with \(10^7\) elements, all initialized to zero. No other variables or states are affected by this function.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
