Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` appears to implement a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. However, there are a few issues:

1. The function `func_1` does not handle the case when the input does not contain enough stones to perform any jumps, i.e., when `n < k + 1`. In such a scenario, the current implementation would lead to out-of-bound access errors because the loop condition `i - j > -1` may never be true.
2. The state of `dp` after the loop should ensure that `dp[i]` contains the minimum cost to reach the `i-th` stone from the first stone. However, the annotation mentions that `dp[i]` is only updated if `dp[i]` is initially `-1` or if the new cost (`tem`) is less than the current cost in `dp[i]`. This logic is correct, but the function does not initialize `dp` correctly for the first jump. The first jump should start from `i=1` and not `i=0`, so `dp[1]` should be initialized to `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])` and then the loop should start from `i=2`.

Given these issues, the program does not fully meet the problem description, hence the original assessment of False remains accurate.
