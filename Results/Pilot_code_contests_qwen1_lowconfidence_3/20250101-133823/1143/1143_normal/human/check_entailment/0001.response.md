Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided has incomplete and incorrect implementations of helper functions (`func_2` and `func_3`) which do not contribute to solving the given problem. The main function (`func_1`) seems to be partially correct but lacks handling for boundary conditions and does not correctly implement the dynamic programming solution.

The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` initializes `dp[0]` to 0 and then iterates through each stone, updating the minimum cost to reach each stone from the previous stones within the range `[i-j, i]`. However, the loop to update `dp[i]` only considers jumps from the previous stone, which is incorrect because the problem allows jumping to any of the next `K` stones. Additionally, the initialization of `dp` with `-1` indicates that it is not properly reset or handled for cases where no valid jump exists.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def min_cost_to_reach_stone(n, k, heights):
    dp = [float('inf')] * n
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(max(0, i-k), i):
            if j < n:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + abs(heights[i] - heights[j]))
    return dp[n-1]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    (n, k) = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    heights = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    print(min_cost_to_reach_stone(n, k, heights))
```

This corrected version ensures that the dynamic programming table `dp` is properly initialized and updated, and it correctly handles the range of jumps allowed.
