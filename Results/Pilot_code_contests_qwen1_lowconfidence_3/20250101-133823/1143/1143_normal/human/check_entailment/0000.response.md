Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program only defines two empty functions `func_2` and `func_3`, but it does not implement the main logic to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is defined, but it uses variables `read()` which are not defined in the provided code snippet. Moreover, the logic inside `func_1` is incomplete and does not correctly implement the dynamic programming approach needed to solve the problem. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and will not work for any input.
