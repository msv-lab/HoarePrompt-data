Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies issues with the provided program. The function `func_1` attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming but has several logical flaws. Specifically, the inner loop in `func_1` only considers jumps from the previous stone, whereas the problem statement allows jumps to any of the next `K` stones. Additionally, the use of `func_2` and `func_3` is irrelevant to the problem at hand and does not affect the correctness of `func_1`. The corrected version provided addresses these issues, but the original program as presented does not correctly implement the solution. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
