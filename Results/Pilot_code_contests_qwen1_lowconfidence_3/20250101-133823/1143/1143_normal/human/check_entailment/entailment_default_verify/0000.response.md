Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is defined but contains several issues:
1. It uses `read()`, which is not defined in the provided code snippet.
2. The logic inside `func_1` is incomplete and does not correctly implement the dynamic programming approach needed to solve the problem.
3. The functions `func_2` and `func_3` are empty and do not contribute to solving the problem.

The output hints provided do not change this assessment. While they describe the behavior of `func_2` and `func_3`, these functions do not affect the overall correctness of the program since they are not called. The primary issue remains that the core logic required to solve the problem is missing or incorrectly implemented in `func_1`. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and is thus assessed as incorrect.
