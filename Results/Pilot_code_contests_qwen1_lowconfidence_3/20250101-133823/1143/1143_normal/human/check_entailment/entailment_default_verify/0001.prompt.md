You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N stones, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N. For each i (1 \leq i \leq N), the height of Stone i is h_i.

There is a frog who is initially on Stone 1. He will repeat the following action some number of times to reach Stone N:

* If the frog is currently on Stone i, jump to one of the following: Stone i + 1, i + 2, \ldots, i + K. Here, a cost of |h_i - h_j| is incurred, where j is the stone to land on.



Find the minimum possible total cost incurred before the frog reaches Stone N.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq K \leq 100
* 1 \leq h_i \leq 10^4

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
h_1 h_2 \ldots h_N

Program:

import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, k) = read()
    arr = read()
    dp = [-1] * n
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            if i - j > -1:
                tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])
                if dp[i] == -1:
                    dp[i] = tem
                elif dp[i] > tem:
                    dp[i] = tem
    print(dp[-1])

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    l = [0] * 10 ** 7

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    l = [0 for i in range(10 ** 7)]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided has incomplete and incorrect implementations of helper functions (`func_2` and `func_3`) which do not contribute to solving the given problem. The main function (`func_1`) seems to be partially correct but lacks handling for boundary conditions and does not correctly implement the dynamic programming solution.

The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` initializes `dp[0]` to 0 and then iterates through each stone, updating the minimum cost to reach each stone from the previous stones within the range `[i-j, i]`. However, the loop to update `dp[i]` only considers jumps from the previous stone, which is incorrect because the problem allows jumping to any of the next `K` stones. Additionally, the initialization of `dp` with `-1` indicates that it is not properly reset or handled for cases where no valid jump exists.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def min_cost_to_reach_stone(n, k, heights):
    dp = [float('inf')] * n
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(max(0, i-k), i):
            if j < n:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + abs(heights[i] - heights[j]))
    return dp[n-1]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    (n, k) = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    heights = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    print(min_cost_to_reach_stone(n, k, heights))
```

This corrected version ensures that the dynamic programming table `dp` is properly initialized and updated, and it correctly handles the range of jumps allowed.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 3 : This function initializes a list `l` containing \(10^7\) elements, each set to zero. There are no inputs accepted by the function, and it does not return anything. The function does not perform any additional operations on the list beyond initialization. Therefore, after the function concludes, the state of the program includes a global list `l` with \(10^7\) elements, all initialized to zero. No other variables or states are affected by this function.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
