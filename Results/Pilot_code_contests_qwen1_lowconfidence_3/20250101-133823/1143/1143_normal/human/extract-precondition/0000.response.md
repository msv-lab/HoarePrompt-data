Precondition: **This function does not use any of the variables from the main problem description. Instead, it initializes a list `l` of zeros with a length of 10^7. This suggests that there might be another function or part of the solution that uses this list to store intermediate results or costs, but no such usage is shown here.**

Given the context, it seems this function is likely a helper or an initial setup for a more complex solution involving dynamic programming or similar techniques. However, based solely on the provided code snippet, we can only describe the initialization of the list `l`.
