The code `dp[i] = tem` assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. Given the initial state, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1`, `dp[0] = 0`, and `tem` is defined as `-1 + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`.

Since the precondition states that the current value of `dp[i]` is `-1`, assigning `tem` to `dp[i]` will change the value of `dp[i]` to `tem`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 and k ≤ n, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` except `dp[i]` which is now equal to `-1 + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, `dp[0] = 0`, `i - j` is greater than -1, `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`.**
