Output State: **`total` is 0, `j` is `k`, `k` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-1`. For each `j` in the range from 1 to `k`, `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum value of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` as long as `i - j > -1`. If no updates were made during the loop, `dp[i]` remains `-1`.**
