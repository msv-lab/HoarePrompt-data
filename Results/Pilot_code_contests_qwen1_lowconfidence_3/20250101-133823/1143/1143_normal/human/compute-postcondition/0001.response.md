The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It initializes a list `l` of zeros with a length of \(10^7\). Given that no other parameters or return values are mentioned, the function does not return anything explicitly.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to initialize a list `l` with \(10^7\) elements, each set to zero.

Functionality: **The function initializes a list `l` with \(10^7\) elements, each set to zero.**
