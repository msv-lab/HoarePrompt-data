Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `j` is 2
   - `k` must be at least 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`
   - `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`)
   - If `i - j > -1`, `dp[i]` is updated to `-1 + |arr[i-2] - arr[i]|` if `dp[i]` is `-1`; otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged as `dp[i] + |arr[i-j] - arr[i]|`
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `tem` is either `-1 + |arr[i-2] - arr[i]|` or `dp[i-j] + |arr[i-j] - arr[i]|` depending on the update of `dp[i]`

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `1` to `k + 1`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - Since `j` is currently `2`, we need to determine the new state when `j` becomes `3`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variable that changes with each iteration of the loop is `j`. The value of `j` will increment by `1` in each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `3`.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `k` remains the same since it is a condition and not changing within the loop.
   - `n` remains the same since it is determined at the beginning and does not change during the loop.
   - `arr` remains the same since it is read once at the beginning and does not change during the loop.
   - `dp` remains the same since its values are set based on the initial conditions and the loop updates it only if necessary.
   - `i` remains `n-1` since it is not modified within the loop.
   - `tem` is also unchanged since it is computed based on the final value of `dp[i]` and does not depend on `j`.

6. **New State:**
   - `j` will be `3`.
   - All other variables remain the same.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`total` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-1`, and `tem` is either `-1 + |arr[i-2] - arr[i]|` or `dp[i-j] + |arr[i-j] - arr[i]|` depending on the update of `dp[i]`.**
