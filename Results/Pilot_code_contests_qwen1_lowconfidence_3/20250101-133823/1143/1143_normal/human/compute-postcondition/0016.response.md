Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\) and \(k \leq n\).
   - `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`.
   - `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`).
   - For each index `i` in `dp`, if `i - j > -1`, `dp[i]` is set to `-1 + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` if `dp[i]` is `-1`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` is set to `tem` if `dp[i] > tem`, where `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. If `i - j` is not greater than -1, the value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged.

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The for loop iterates over `j` from `1` to `k + 1`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - We need to determine what changes occur within the loop and how the states change as we move from one iteration to the next.

Since the loop body is omitted, let's consider the general behavior of the loop:

- The loop updates the `dp` list based on the current value of `j`.
- The condition `i - j > -1` ensures that the indices accessed in `arr` are valid.
- The value of `dp[i]` is updated based on the condition described.

After the loop completes for a given `j`, the following states need to be adjusted for the next iteration:

- The value of `j` will increment by 1.
- The `dp` list will be updated according to the loop logic, but the specific values depend on the loop body, which is not provided.

Given that the loop runs from `1` to `k + 1`, the next value of `j` will be `k + 1` if the current value is `k`.

**Adjusted States for the Start of the Next Iteration:**

- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `k` remains the same since it is an upper limit and does not change within the loop.
- `arr` remains unchanged as it is only read once before the loop starts.
- `dp` will be updated according to the loop logic, but the exact values depend on the loop body. However, we know that the loop will continue to update `dp` based on the new value of `j`.

Therefore, the states to be adjusted are:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\) and \(k \leq n\), `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`).**
