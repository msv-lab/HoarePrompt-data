Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `j` is 1
   - `k` must be at least 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`
   - `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`)
   - `i` is `n-2`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, k + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `k`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` should become 2.

4. **States to Adjust:**
   - `j` should be updated to 2.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `arr` remains unchanged.
   - `dp` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains unchanged.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `total` is still 0.
   - `j` is now 2.
   - `k` must be at least 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `arr` is unchanged.
   - `dp` is unchanged.
   - `i` is unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`total` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-2`.**
