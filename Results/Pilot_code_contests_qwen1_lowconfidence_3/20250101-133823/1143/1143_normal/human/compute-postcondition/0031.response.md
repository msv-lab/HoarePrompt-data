To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues. The loop iterates over the range `range(n)`, which means it runs from `0` to `n-1`.

Given the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\) and \(k \leq n\).
- `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`.
- `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`).

For the loop to continue executing one more time, the loop condition `i < n` must hold true. This means that the current value of `i` should be less than `n`.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was previously less than `n`, after incrementing `i` by 1, `i` will become equal to `n-1` if it was `n-2` before, or `i` will become `n` if it was `n-1` before.

However, the loop will stop when `i` reaches `n` because the condition `i < n` fails. To ensure the loop can continue for one more iteration, `i` needs to be set to `n-1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is `n-1` and the loop can proceed to the next iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\) and \(k \leq n\), `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-1`**.
