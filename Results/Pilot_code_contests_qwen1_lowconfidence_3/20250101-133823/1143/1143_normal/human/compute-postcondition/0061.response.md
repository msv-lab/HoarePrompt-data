`tem` is assigned the value of `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. Given the initial state:
- `total` is 0
- `j` is 1
- `k` must be at least 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`
- `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`)
- `i` is `n-2`

Since `i` is `n-2`, and `j` is `1`, `i - j` is `n-3`. Thus, `dp[i - j]` is `dp[n-3]` and `arr[i - j]` is `arr[n-3]`. The value of `tem` is calculated as follows:
- `dp[n-3]` is `-1` because the list `dp` is initialized with `-1` for all indices except `0`.
- `abs(arr[n-3] - arr[n-2])` computes the absolute difference between `arr[n-3]` and `arr[n-2]`.

Therefore, `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[n-3] - arr[n-2])`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-2`, `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[n-3] - arr[n-2])**
