Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 and \(k \leq n\), `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`). After all iterations of the loop, for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to reach index `i` starting from index `0`, where the cost is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `arr` up to the current index `i`. If `i - j` is not greater than -1, the value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged. If the loop does not execute at all, `dp` remains a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`).**
