Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`). If `i - j > -1`, `dp[i]` is updated to `-1 + |arr[i-2] - arr[i]|` if `dp[i]` is `-1`; otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged as `dp[i] + |arr[i-j] - arr[i]|`. `i` is `n-1`, and `tem` is either `-1 + |arr[i-2] - arr[i]|` or `dp[i-j] + |arr[i-j] - arr[i]|` depending on the update of `dp[i]`.***
