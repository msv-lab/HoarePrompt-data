The code assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. Given that `tem` is defined as `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, and the other variables are unchanged, we can calculate the new value of `dp[i]`.

Here are the known values:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `j` is 2
- `dp[0]` is `0`
- `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` except for `dp[0]`

Let's substitute the values:
- `dp[i - j]` becomes `dp[n - 1 - 2] = dp[n - 3]`
- Since `dp` is initialized with `-1` for all indices except `dp[0]`, `dp[n - 3]` is `-1`
- `arr[i - j]` becomes `arr[n - 1 - 2] = arr[n - 3]`
- `arr[i]` becomes `arr[n - 1]`

So, `tem` is calculated as:
\[ \text{tem} = dp[n - 3] + |arr[n - 3] - arr[n - 1]| = -1 + |arr[n - 3] - arr[n - 1]| \]

Thus, `dp[i]` is set to this value.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` with `dp[0]` being `0` and all other elements being `-1` except `dp[n - 3]` which is now `-1 + |arr[n - 3] - arr[n - 1]|`, `i` is `n - 1`, `tem` is `-1 + |arr[n - 3] - arr[n - 1]|**, `dp[i]` is `-1 + |arr[n - 3] - arr[n - 1]|`.
