The code assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. From the initial state, we know:

- `total` is 0
- `j` is 2
- `k` must be at least 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `arr` is the value returned by `read()`
- `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`)
- `i` is `n-1`
- `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`

Since `i` is `n-1` and `j` is 2, `i - j` is `(n-1) - 2 = n-3`. Therefore, `tem` is `dp[n-3] + abs(arr[n-3] - arr[n-1])`.

After executing `dp[i] = tem`, the value of `dp[i]` (which is `dp[n-1]`) is set to this value.

Output State: **`total` is 0; `j` is 2; `k` must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `arr` is the value returned by `read()`; `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`); `i` is `n-1`; `dp[i-1]` is `dp[n-3] + abs(arr[n-3] - arr[n-1]); dp[i]` (which is `dp[n-1]`) is `dp[n-3] + abs(arr[n-3] - arr[n-1])`.**
