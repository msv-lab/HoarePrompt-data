`tem` is assigned the value of `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. Given the initial state:
- `total` is 0
- `j` is 3
- `k` must be at least 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`
- `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`)
- `i` is `n-2`

We know that `i = n - 2` and `j = 3`, so `i - j = n - 5`. Since `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `dp[i - j]` is `-1`. Also, `abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` is the absolute difference between `arr[n - 5]` and `arr[n - 2]`.

Therefore, the value of `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[n - 5] - arr[n - 2])`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-2`, `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[n - 5] - arr[n - 2])**
