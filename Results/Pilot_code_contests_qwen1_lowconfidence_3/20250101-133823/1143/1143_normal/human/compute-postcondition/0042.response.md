Postcondition: ***`total` is `0`, `j` is `1`, `k` must be at least `1`, `n` must be greater than `0`, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-1`, and `dp[i]` is updated to `-1 + abs(arr[n-2] - arr[n-1])` if `dp[i] == -1` and this value is smaller than the current `dp[i]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i - 1] + abs(arr[i - 1] - arr[i])` if this value is smaller than the current `dp[i]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
