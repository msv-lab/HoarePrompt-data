According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, we know the following:

- `n` is an integer representing the number of stones.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100.
- `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`.
- `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1`, and `dp[0] = 0`.

The initial state provided ensures that `dp` is correctly initialized, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute unless `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, since the loop starts with `i` starting from 0, `i` will be 0 initially.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1`, `dp[0] = 0`**
