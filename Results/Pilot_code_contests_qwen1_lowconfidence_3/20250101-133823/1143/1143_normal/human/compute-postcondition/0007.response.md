The code assigns the value `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` to the variable `tem`. Here, `dp[i - j]` is `-1` because it is initialized to `-1` in the precondition, and `abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` is the absolute difference between `arr[i - j]` and `arr[i]`.

Since the exact values of `arr[i - j]` and `arr[i]` are not specified, we cannot simplify `abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` further. However, we know that `dp[i - j]` is `-1`. Thus, the value of `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `dp`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 and k ≤ n, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1`, `dp[0] = 0`, `i - j` is greater than -1, `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`**
