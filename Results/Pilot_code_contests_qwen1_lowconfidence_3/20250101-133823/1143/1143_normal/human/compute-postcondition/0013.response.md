Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 and k ≤ n, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1`, `dp[0] = 0`, `i - j` is greater than -1, and `dp[i]` is set to `tem` if `dp[i] > tem`. Since there is no else part, `dp[i]` remains unchanged if the condition `dp[i] > tem` is not met.***
