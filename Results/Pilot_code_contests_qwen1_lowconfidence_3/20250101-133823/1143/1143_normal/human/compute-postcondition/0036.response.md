The code `dp[i] = tem` updates the value of `dp[i]` to `tem`. From the initial state, `tem` is defined as `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. Given the values of the variables, we can substitute the known values:

- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` is `1`
- `dp[i - j]` becomes `dp[n-2]` because `i - j = (n-1) - 1 = n-2`
- `dp[0]` is `0`
- `dp[n-2]` is `-1` (since `dp` is initialized with `-1` for all indices except `dp[0]`)

Therefore, `dp[i - j]` is `-1`.

Next, `abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` simplifies to `abs(arr[n-2] - arr[n-1])`.

Given these, `tem` becomes `-1 + abs(arr[n-2] - arr[n-1])`.

Since `dp[i]` was previously `-1`, it is now updated to `tem`, which is `-1 + abs(arr[n-2] - arr[n-1])`.

Output State: **`total` is `0`, `j` is `1`, `k` must be at least `1`, `n` must be greater than `0`, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-1`, `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, `dp[i]` is `-1 + abs(arr[n-2] - arr[n-1])**
