Let's go through the code step-by-step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `total` is 0
   - `j` is 3
   - `k` must be at least 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`
   - `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`)
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `tem` is either `-1 + |arr[i-2] - arr[i]|` or `dp[i-j] + |arr[i-j] - arr[i]|` depending on the update of `dp[i]`.

2. The code snippet updates the value of `tem`:
   ```python
   tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])
   ```

3. From the initial state, we know:
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `j` is 3
   - So, `i - j` would be `(n-1) - 3 = n - 4`

4. Since `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`):
   - `dp[n-4]` will be `-1` unless it was previously updated.

5. `arr[i - j]` is `arr[n - 4]` and `arr[i]` is `arr[n - 1]`.

6. Therefore, `tem` will be calculated as:
   ```python
   tem = -1 + abs(arr[n - 4] - arr[n - 1])
   ```

7. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-1`, `tem` is `-1 + |arr[n-4] - arr[n-1]|**
