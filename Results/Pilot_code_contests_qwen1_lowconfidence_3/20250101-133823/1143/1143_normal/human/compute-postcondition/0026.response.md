`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `tem`. According to the initial state, `tem` is defined as `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, where `j` is `k + 1`. The value of `dp` remains unchanged except for the assignment at index `i`. The value of `arr` remains unchanged as well since no operation is performed on it in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, `dp` remains a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `arr` remains the value returned by `read()`, `dp[i]` is `tem`, `j` is `k + 1`.**
