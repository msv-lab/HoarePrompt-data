The code `dp[i] = tem` assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. According to the initial state, `tem` is defined as `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` except for `dp[0]` which is `0`, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, and `j` is `k + 1`.

After executing `dp[i] = tem`, the value of `dp[i]` is updated to `tem`, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` except for `dp[0]` which is `0`, `dp[i]` is `tem`, `arr` is the value returned by `read()`, `j` is `k + 1`.**
