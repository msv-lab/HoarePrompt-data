Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 and k ≤ n, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1`, `dp[0] = 0`, `i - j` is greater than -1, `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. The current value of `dp[i]` is -1.***
