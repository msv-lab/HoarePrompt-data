`dp[0]` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `dp[0]` was `-1`, so it has been updated. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of stones, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1`, `dp[0] = 0`**
