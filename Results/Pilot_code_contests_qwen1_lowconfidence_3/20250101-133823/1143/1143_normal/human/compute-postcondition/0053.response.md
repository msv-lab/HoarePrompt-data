The code `dp[i] = tem` assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. From the initial state, we know that `i` is `n-1`, and `tem` is `-1 + |arr[n-4] - arr[n-1]|`. Therefore, `dp[i-1]` (which is `dp[n-1]`) is set to this value.

- `total` remains 0.
- `j` remains 3.
- `k` must still be at least 1.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `arr` remains the value returned by `read()`.
- `dp` remains a list of length `n` filled with `-1` except for `dp[0]` which is `0`.
- `i` is now `n-1` (unchanged in this line of code).
- `tem` is `-1 + |arr[n-4] - arr[n-1]|`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0; `j` is 3; `k` must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`); `i` is `n-1`; `dp[i-1]` is `-1 + |arr[n-4] - arr[n-1]|`.

Output State: **`total` is 0; `j` is 3; `k` must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`); `i` is `n-1`; `dp[i-1]` is `-1 + |arr[n-4] - arr[n-1]|**.
