Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-1`, `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. If `dp[i]` is greater than `tem`, `dp[i]` remains unchanged; otherwise, `dp[i]` is set to `tem`.***
