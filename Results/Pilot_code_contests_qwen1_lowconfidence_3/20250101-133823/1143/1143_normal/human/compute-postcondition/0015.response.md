Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 and k ≤ n, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`). For each index `i` in `dp`, if `i - j > -1`, `dp[i]` is set to `-1 + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` if `dp[i]` is `-1`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` is set to `tem` if `dp[i] > tem`, where `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. If `i - j` is not greater than -1, the value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
