`tem` is assigned the value `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. The value of `dp[i - j]` is `-1` because `dp` is filled with `-1` except for `dp[0]` which is `0`. The value of `i - j` is greater than `-1`, so `arr[i - j]` and `arr[i]` are valid indices in the list `arr`. However, since the exact values of `arr[i - j]` and `arr[i]` are not provided, we will keep them as they are.

Therefore, the output state is: `total` is `0`, `j` is `1`, `k` must be at least `1`, `n` must be greater than `0`, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-1`, and `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`.

Output State: **`total` is `0`, `j` is `1`, `k` must be at least `1`, `n` must be greater than `0`, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-1`, `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])**.
