The code updates the value of `dp[i]` to the value of `tem`. Let's break down the values:

- `total` is 0 and does not change.
- `j` is 2 and does not change.
- `k` must be at least 1 and does not change.
- `n` must be greater than 0 and does not change.
- `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`.
- `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`).
- `i` is `n-2` and does not change.
- `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`.

Given `i` is `n-2` and `j` is 2, `i - j` would be `(n-2) - 2 = n-4`. So, `dp[i - j]` is `dp[n-4]`, which is `-1` because all elements in `dp` are initially `-1` except `dp[0]`.

Therefore, `tem` is calculated as:
\[ tem = dp[n-4] + abs(arr[n-4] - arr[n-2]) = -1 + abs(arr[n-4] - arr[n-2]) \]

Now, `dp[i]` is set to `tem`, so `dp[n-2]` becomes `-1 + abs(arr[n-4] - arr[n-2])`.

Output State: **`total` is 0; `j` is 2; `k` must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`; `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`); `i` is `n-2`; `dp[n-2]` is `-1 + abs(arr[n-4] - arr[n-2])`.**
