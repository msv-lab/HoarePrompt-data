Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the state adjustments needed at the start of the next iteration of the for loop.

### Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:
- `total` is `0`
- `j` is `1`
- `k` must be at least `1`
- `n` must be greater than `0`
- `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`
- `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`)
- `i` is `n-1`
- `dp[i]` is updated to `-1 + abs(arr[n-2] - arr[n-1])` if `dp[i] == -1` and this value is smaller than the current `dp[i]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i - 1] + abs(arr[i - 1] - arr[i])` if this value is smaller than the current `dp[i]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.

### For Loop:
```python
for j in range(1, k + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = k`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `1`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `2`.

### Adjusting States:
- **`j`**: Needs to be incremented to `2`.
- **Other Variables**: No other variables in the initial state provided are directly affected by the loop condition. Therefore, they remain unchanged.

### Final State at the Start of Next Iteration:
- `total` is `0`
- `j` is `2` (incremented from `1`)
- `k` must be at least `1`
- `n` must be greater than `0`
- `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`
- `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`)
- `i` is `n-1`
- `dp[i]` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

### Answer:
State: **`total` is `0`, `j` is `2`, `k` must be at least `1`, `n` must be greater than `0`, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-1`, and `dp[i]` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.**
