The code assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. From the initial state, `i` is `n-2`, `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[n - 5] - arr[n - 2])`, and `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` except for `dp[0]` which is `0`.

After executing `dp[i] = tem`, the value of `dp[i]` (which is `dp[n-2]`) will be set to `tem`. So, `dp[n-2]` will be `-1 + abs(arr[n - 5] - arr[n - 2])`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-2`, `dp[n-2]` is `-1 + abs(arr[n - 5] - arr[n - 2]), `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[n - 5] - arr[n - 2])**
