The code prints the last element of the `dp` list, which is `dp[-1]`. The value of `dp[-1]` is determined by the minimum cost to reach the last index of the array starting from the first index. The cost is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `arr` up to the current index `i`.

Since the code does not modify `dp` or `arr` directly but instead relies on the loop to fill `dp`, and given the initial state where `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), the only way to determine the final value of `dp[-1]` is through the logic within the loop. However, since no specific values or operations are provided for the loop, the output state remains based on the initial state and the operation of printing `dp[-1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 and \(k \leq n\), `arr` is a list updated by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` except `dp[0]` which is `0`, the value of `dp[-1]` is determined by the minimum cost to reach the last index starting from the first index, and the code prints `dp[-1]`.**
