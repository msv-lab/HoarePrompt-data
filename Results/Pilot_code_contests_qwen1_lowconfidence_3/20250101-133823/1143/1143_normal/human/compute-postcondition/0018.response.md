The code snippet updates the `dp` list such that `dp[i]` is assigned the value of `tem`, where `tem` is defined as `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\) and \(k \leq n\)
- `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`
- `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`)
- `tem` is assigned the value `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`

After the line `dp[i] = tem` executes, `dp[i]` is set to the value of `tem`. However, since `tem` is not defined in terms of specific values but rather as a function of `dp[i - j]` and `abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for `dp[i]` without knowing the specific values of `i`, `j`, `dp[i - j]`, and `arr[i - j]` and `arr[i]`.

Therefore, the only thing that changes is the assignment of `dp[i]` to `tem`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\) and \(k \leq n\), `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `dp[i]` is assigned the value of `tem`, `tem` is assigned the value `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`**
