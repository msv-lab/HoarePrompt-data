Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-2`. If `dp[i] > tem`, then `dp[n-2]` is updated to `tem`. Otherwise, `dp[n-2]` remains unchanged, which is `-1 + abs(arr[n - 5] - arr[n - 2])***
