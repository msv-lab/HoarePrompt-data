Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `total` is 0
- `j` is `k`
- `k` must be at least 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`
- `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`)
- `i` is `n-2`

### For Loop:
```
for j in range(1, k + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - `j` is initialized to `k`.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `k + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will run as long as `j` is less than `k + 1`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - In each iteration, `j` will increment by 1 starting from 1 until it reaches `k + 1`.

4. **Initial Values:**
   - Since `j` is initially set to `k`, the loop will start from `k` if `k` is greater than or equal to 1.

5. **Range of Loop:**
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must start from 1 and go up to `k + 1`.
   - This means `j` should be able to increment from 1 to `k + 1`.

### States to Adjust:
- `j` must be set to `1` initially, not `k`.
- `k` must be at least 1 to ensure the loop starts.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-2`**
