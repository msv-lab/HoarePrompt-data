Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\) and \(k \leq n\), `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`). For each index `i` from `j` to `n-1`, if `dp[i]` is initially `-1`, it is assigned the value of `tem`, where `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. If `dp[i]` is not `-1`, it is updated to `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` if this new value is greater than the current value of `dp[i]`, otherwise it remains unchanged.***
