Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of stones), `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100), and `arr` (a list of integers representing the heights of the stones). It calculates the minimum cost to jump from the first stone to the last stone, where each jump can be up to `k` stones away. The cost of a jump is the absolute difference in height between the two stones. The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to reach the `i-th` stone from the first stone. The function iterates through the stones, updating `dp[i]` with the minimum cost to reach each stone. Finally, the function prints the minimum cost to reach the last stone (`dp[-1]`).**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- If `k` is equal to `n`, the function will always consider jumping to the last stone directly, making the minimum cost zero.
- If `k` is greater than `n`, the function will treat `k` as `n` because the maximum jump limit cannot exceed the number of stones.
- The code does not handle the case where the list `arr` might contain duplicate heights, which could potentially affect the cost calculation.
- The code assumes that the `abs` function is available and correctly computes the absolute difference.
