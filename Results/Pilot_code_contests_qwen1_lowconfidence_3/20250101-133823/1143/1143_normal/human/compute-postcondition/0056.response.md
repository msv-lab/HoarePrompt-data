Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-1`. If `dp[i] == -1 + |arr[i-3] - arr[i]|`, then `dp[i]` remains unchanged. If `dp[i] > -1 + |arr[i-3] - arr[i]|`, then `dp[i]` is set to `-1 + |arr[i-3] - arr[i]|`.**
