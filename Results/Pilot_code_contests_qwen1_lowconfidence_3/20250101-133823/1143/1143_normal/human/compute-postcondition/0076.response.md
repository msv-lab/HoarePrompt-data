Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-2`. If `i - j > -1` and `dp[i]` is `-1`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `-1 + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
