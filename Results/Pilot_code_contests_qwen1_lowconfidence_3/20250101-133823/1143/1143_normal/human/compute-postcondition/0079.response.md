The code assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. Given that `tem` is calculated as `-1 + abs(arr[n - 5] - arr[n - 2])`, and `i` is `n-2`, the assignment `dp[i] = tem` changes the value of `dp[i]` to this calculated value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Here's the breakdown:
- `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[n - 5] - arr[n - 2])`.
- `i` is `n-2`, so `dp[i]` becomes `dp[n-2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`total` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-2`, `dp[n-2]` is `-1 + abs(arr[n - 5] - arr[n - 2]), `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[n - 5] - arr[n - 2])**.
