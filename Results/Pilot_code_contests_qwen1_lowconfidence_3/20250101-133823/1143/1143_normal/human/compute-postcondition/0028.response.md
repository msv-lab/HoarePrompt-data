Postcondition: ***`tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, `dp` remains a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `arr` remains the value returned by `read()`, `j` is `k + 1`. If `dp[i] == -1`, then `dp[i]` is set to `tem`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` is set to `tem` if `dp[i] > tem`, otherwise it remains unchanged.***
