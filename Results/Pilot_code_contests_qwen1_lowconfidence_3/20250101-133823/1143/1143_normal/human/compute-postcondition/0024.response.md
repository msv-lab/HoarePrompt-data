In the given code snippet, `tem` is assigned the value of `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. Let's analyze this step by step:

1. `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`).
2. `j` is `k + 1`.
3. `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`.
4. `n` must be greater than 0.
5. `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\) and \(k \leq n\).

Given these conditions, let's consider the impact on the variables:

- `tem` is assigned the value of `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`.
- Since `dp` is initialized with `-1` for all indices except `dp[0]`, `dp[i - j]` will be `-1` unless `i - j` is `0`.
- `abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` computes the absolute difference between `arr[i - j]` and `arr[i]`.

Since `dp[i - j]` will be `-1` for most cases (unless `i - j` is `0`), `tem` will essentially be `abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` in most cases.

The output state after running the code snippet is:

Output State: **`tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, `dp` remains a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `j` is `k + 1`.**
