Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\) and \(k \leq n\), `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), and `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i]) if dp[i] > dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.**
