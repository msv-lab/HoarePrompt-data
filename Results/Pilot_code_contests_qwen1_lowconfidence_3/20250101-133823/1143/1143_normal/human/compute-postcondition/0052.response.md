The code sets `dp[i]` to the value of `tem`. From the initial state, we know that `i` is `n-1` and `tem` is `-1 + |arr[n-4] - arr[n-1]|`. The value of `dp[i]` will therefore be `tem`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-1`, `tem` is `-1 + |arr[n-4] - arr[n-1]|`, `dp[i]` is `-1 + |arr[n-4] - arr[n-1]|**
