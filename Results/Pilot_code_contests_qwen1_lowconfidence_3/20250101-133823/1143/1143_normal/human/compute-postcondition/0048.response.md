Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`). If `dp[i]` (where `i` is `n-1`) is `-1`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `-1 + |arr[i-2] - arr[i]|`; otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged. `i` is `n-1`, and `tem` is either `-1 + |arr[i-2] - arr[i]|` or `dp[i-j] + |arr[i-j] - arr[i]|` depending on the update of `dp[i]`.**
