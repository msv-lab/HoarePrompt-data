The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `arr`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of stones.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100.
- `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the stones (h_1, h_2, ..., h_n) where 1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^4.

Based on the provided information, the function does not specify any particular return value directly, but it implies that the function might perform some operation or calculation involving these parameters. However, since no specific output cases are provided, we can only describe the parameters accepted by the function.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, an integer `k` within the range 1 to 100, and a list of integers `arr` representing stone heights. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer), `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100), and `arr` (a list of integers).**
