Let's break down the given information and the requirements of the for loop to determine the necessary adjustments.

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100.
   - `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`.
   - `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1`.
   - `dp[0] = 0`.

2. **For Loop**:
   ```
   for j in range(1, k + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = k` inclusive.
   - For the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1 (which is already given as part of the constraints).
   - Additionally, the loop requires `k` to be less than or equal to `n` since `range(1, k + 1)` should be within valid indices of `dp`.

Given these points, let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- Since `k` must be within the bounds of `1 ≤ k ≤ 100`, we need to ensure `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `n`.
- We need to include the initial state of `dp` being a list of length `n` filled with `-1` and `dp[0] = 0`.

So, the final state before the loop should be:

**`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 and k ≤ n, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1`, `dp[0] = 0`**. 

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 and k ≤ n, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1`, `dp[0] = 0`**.
