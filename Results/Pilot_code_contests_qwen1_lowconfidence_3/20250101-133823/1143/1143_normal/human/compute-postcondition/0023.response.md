To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and how the variables change within the loop.

### Given Information:
- **Initial Conditions at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
  - `n` must be greater than 0.
  - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\) and \(k \leq n\).
  - `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`.
  - `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`).

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for j in range(1, k + 1):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = k`.

2. **What Changes Within the Loop?**
   - The variable `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - No explicit changes are mentioned for `n`, `k`, `arr`, or `dp` within the loop body.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `j`:**
   - Since the loop runs from `1` to `k`, the next value of `j` would be `k + 1`.

4. **Check the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < k + 1`.
   - Therefore, the loop will stop when `j` reaches `k + 1`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - `j` will be incremented to `k + 1`.
   - `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `dp` remain unchanged because no changes are mentioned in the loop body.

### Conclusion:

At the start of the next iteration (which is the final iteration since `j` will be incremented to `k + 1`), the values of `j` will be `k + 1`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, and `dp`) remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**State:**
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\) and \(k \leq n\).
- `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`.
- `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`).
- `j` is `k + 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\) and \(k \leq n\), `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `j` is `k + 1`**
