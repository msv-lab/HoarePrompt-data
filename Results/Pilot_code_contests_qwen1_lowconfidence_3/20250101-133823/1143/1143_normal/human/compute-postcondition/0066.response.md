`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `tem`. Given that `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[n-3] - arr[n-2])`, the value of `dp[i]` changes from its previous value (which is greater than `tem`) to `tem`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-2`, `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[n-3] - arr[n-2]), `dp[i]` is equal to `tem`.**
