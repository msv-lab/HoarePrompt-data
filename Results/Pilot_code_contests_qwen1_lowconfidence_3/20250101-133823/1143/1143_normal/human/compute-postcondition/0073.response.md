`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `tem`. Given that `i` is `n-2`, `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, and `j` is 2, we can substitute these values into the equation. 

Since `dp` is initially a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), and `i` is `n-2`, `dp[i - j]` is `dp[n-4]`. The value of `dp[n-4]` is `-1` because it was initialized as such.

Therefore, `tem` becomes `-1 + abs(arr[n-4] - arr[n-2])`.

After updating `dp[i]` with this value, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-2`, `dp[i]` is `-1 + abs(arr[n-4] - arr[n-2])**
