Postcondition: **`total` is `0`, `j` is `1`, `k` must be at least `1`, `n` must be greater than `0`, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-1`, `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i]), and `dp[i]` is not equal to `-1`**
