Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `read()`, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` (except `dp[0]` which is `0`), `i` is `n-1`. If `dp[i] > tem`, then `dp[i-1]` remains as `-1 + |arr[n-4] - arr[n-1]|`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change from the if part.***
