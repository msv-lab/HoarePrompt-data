The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of stones), `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100), and `arr` (a list of integers representing the heights of the stones). It calculates the minimum cost to jump from the first stone to the last stone, where each jump can be up to `k` stones away. The cost of a jump is the absolute difference in height between the two stones. The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to reach the `i-th` stone from the first stone. The function iterates through the stones, updating `dp[i]` with the minimum cost to reach each stone. Finally, the function prints the minimum cost to reach the last stone (`dp[-1]`).
