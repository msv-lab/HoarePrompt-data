You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have r red, g green and b blue balloons. To decorate a single table for the banquet you need exactly three balloons. Three balloons attached to some table shouldn't have the same color. What maximum number t of tables can be decorated if we know number of balloons of each color?

Your task is to write a program that for given values r, g and b will find the maximum number t of tables, that can be decorated in the required manner.

Input

The single line contains three integers r, g and b (0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·109) — the number of red, green and blue baloons respectively. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.

Output

Print a single integer t — the maximum number of tables that can be decorated in the required manner.

Note

In the first sample you can decorate the tables with the following balloon sets: "rgg", "gbb", "brr", "rrg", where "r", "g" and "b" represent the red, green and blue balls, respectively.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string input containing three non-negative integers representing the number of red, green, and blue balloons separated by exactly one space. It then processes these values to calculate a new count of balloons (`t`) based on specific rules. The function first sorts the input values, subtracts the count of red balloons from both green and blue, and adjusts the counts further based on the remaining green and blue balloons. Specifically, it adds to `t` the integer division of green by 3, subtracts the remainder of green divided by 3 from blue, and finally increments `t` based on certain conditions involving the remaining green and blue balloons. The function then calls `func_2` with the calculated value of `t`. Potential edge cases include when all inputs are zero, or when the remaining green and blue balloons do not meet the specified conditions.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are no specific variables related to the problem statement in the function signature. However, based on the problem description, the function should receive the number of red (r), green (g), and blue (b) balloons as arguments, such that 0 <= r, g, b <= 2 * 10^9.

    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)

        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sep` is ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` is a list of all the arguments provided, the standard output contains the concatenation of all the string representations of the elements in `args` separated by spaces.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`sep` is ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` is a list of all the arguments provided; the standard output ends with a newline character; if `kwargs` does not contain a key 'flush', `sys.stdout` buffer is flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` accepts three parameters `r`, `g`, and `b`, representing the number of red, green, and blue balloons respectively. It does not return any value. After executing the function, the standard output will contain a string where the numbers of red, green, and blue balloons are concatenated together with a space separator. If the function is called with additional keyword arguments `sep`, `file`, `end`, `flush`, the respective functionalities are applied to modify the output. Specifically:
- `sep` changes the separator between the numbers to the specified value (default is a space).
- `file` specifies the file to write to (default is `sys.stdout`).
- `end` appends the specified value to the end of the output (default is a newline).
- `flush` forces the output buffer to be flushed if the specified value is `True`.

However, the function does not perform any calculations or manipulations on the input parameters `r`, `g`, and `b`. It simply outputs them as a string with the specified formatting. Additionally, the function does not handle any edge cases where the input values might be outside the valid range (0 <= r, g, b <= 2 * 10^9).




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
