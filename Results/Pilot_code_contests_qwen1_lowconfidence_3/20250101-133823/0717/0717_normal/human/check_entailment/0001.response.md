Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of tables that can be decorated. Specifically, the function `func_1` has issues with how it handles the distribution of balloons among the tables.

For example, consider the input `3 3 2`. According to the problem description, the maximum number of tables that can be decorated is 2. However, the program incorrectly calculates this as 3.

Here's a breakdown of the issue:

1. The program sorts the balloons but then uses the original order to calculate the number of tables.
2. The logic for calculating the number of tables is flawed because it does not account for the optimal way to use the balloons.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the number of tables is calculated by considering the minimum count of any two colors of balloons, as each table requires one balloon of each of two different colors.

A corrected version of the program would look like this:

```python
def max_tables(r, g, b):
    # Ensure r, g, b are sorted
    (r, g, b) = sorted([r, g, b])
    # Calculate the maximum number of tables
    return min(r, g, b * 3 // 2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    r, g, b = map(int, input().split())
    print(max_tables(r, g, b))
```

This corrected version ensures that the program calculates the maximum number of tables correctly for all inputs.
