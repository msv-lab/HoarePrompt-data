Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of tables that can be decorated. The function `func_2` is designed to output the values of `r`, `g`, and `b` as a string with specified formatting but does not contribute to solving the problem. The primary function `func_1` attempts to solve the problem but has flaws in its logic, as evidenced by the examples provided. For instance, the input `3 3 2` should yield `2` tables, but the program incorrectly calculates this as `3`. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description, and the original assessment of its correctness being `False` is valid.
