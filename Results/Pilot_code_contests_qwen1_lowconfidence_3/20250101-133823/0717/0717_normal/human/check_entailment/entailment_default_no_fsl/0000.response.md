Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly calculate the maximum number of tables that can be decorated. Specifically, the calculation in `func_1` does not properly account for the different combinations of remaining green and blue balloons after subtracting the initial `r` red balloons. 

For instance, consider the input `3 2 2`. According to the problem description, the maximum number of tables that can be decorated is 2. However, the current implementation would incorrectly calculate this as 1 because it does not fully account for the combinations of remaining green and blue balloons.

Here's a breakdown of the issue:
- The code sorts the balloons and subtracts the number of red balloons from the green and blue balloons.
- It then calculates `t` by adding the integer division of green by 3 and adjusting based on the remaining green and blue balloons.
- The condition `(g == 1 and b > 1) + (g == 2 and b > 0)` only partially accounts for the possible combinations and does not ensure the maximum number of tables are calculated.

A correct approach would involve more detailed logic to ensure all possible combinations of remaining green and blue balloons are considered to maximize the number of tables.
