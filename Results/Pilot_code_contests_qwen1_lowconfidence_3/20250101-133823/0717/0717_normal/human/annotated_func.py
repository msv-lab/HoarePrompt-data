#State of the program right berfore the function call: r, g, and b are non-negative integers representing the number of red, green, and blue balloons respectively, and they are separated by exactly one space in the input.
def func_1():
    r, g, b = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
    t = r
    g -= r
    b -= r
    t += g // 3

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string input containing three non-negative integers representing the number of red, green, and blue balloons separated by exactly one space. It then processes these values to calculate a new count of balloons (`t`) based on specific rules. The function first sorts the input values, subtracts the count of red balloons from both green and blue, and adjusts the counts further based on the remaining green and blue balloons. Specifically, it adds to `t` the integer division of green by 3, subtracts the remainder of green divided by 3 from blue, and finally increments `t` based on certain conditions involving the remaining green and blue balloons. The function then calls `func_2` with the calculated value of `t`. Potential edge cases include when all inputs are zero, or when the remaining green and blue balloons do not meet the specified conditions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are no specific variables related to the problem statement in the function signature. However, based on the problem description, the function should receive the number of red (r), green (g), and blue (b) balloons as arguments, such that 0 <= r, g, b <= 2 * 10^9.
def func_2():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sep` is ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` is a list of all the arguments provided, the standard output contains the concatenation of all the string representations of the elements in `args` separated by spaces.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`sep` is ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` is a list of all the arguments provided; the standard output ends with a newline character; if `kwargs` does not contain a key 'flush', `sys.stdout` buffer is flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` accepts three parameters `r`, `g`, and `b`, representing the number of red, green, and blue balloons respectively. It does not return any value. After executing the function, the standard output will contain a string where the numbers of red, green, and blue balloons are concatenated together with a space separator. If the function is called with additional keyword arguments `sep`, `file`, `end`, `flush`, the respective functionalities are applied to modify the output. Specifically:
- `sep` changes the separator between the numbers to the specified value (default is a space).
- `file` specifies the file to write to (default is `sys.stdout`).
- `end` appends the specified value to the end of the output (default is a newline).
- `flush` forces the output buffer to be flushed if the specified value is `True`.

However, the function does not perform any calculations or manipulations on the input parameters `r`, `g`, and `b`. It simply outputs them as a string with the specified formatting. Additionally, the function does not handle any edge cases where the input values might be outside the valid range (0 <= r, g, b <= 2 * 10^9).
