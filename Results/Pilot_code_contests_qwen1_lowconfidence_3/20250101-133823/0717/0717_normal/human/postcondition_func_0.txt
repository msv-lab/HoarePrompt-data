The function `func_1` accepts a string input containing three non-negative integers representing the number of red, green, and blue balloons separated by exactly one space. It then processes these values to calculate a new count of balloons (`t`) based on specific rules. The function first sorts the input values, subtracts the count of red balloons from both green and blue, and adjusts the counts further based on the remaining green and blue balloons. Specifically, it adds to `t` the integer division of green by 3, subtracts the remainder of green divided by 3 from blue, and finally increments `t` based on certain conditions involving the remaining green and blue balloons. The function then calls `func_2` with the calculated value of `t`. Potential edge cases include when all inputs are zero, or when the remaining green and blue balloons do not meet the specified conditions.
