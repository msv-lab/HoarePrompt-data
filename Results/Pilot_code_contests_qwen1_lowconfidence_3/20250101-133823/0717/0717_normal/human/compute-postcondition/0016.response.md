Postcondition: ***`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least 3 elements, the third element of `args` is `x`, and the standard output contains the string representation of the third element in `args` followed by a space. Since the `if` condition is `not at_start`, which is `False`, the `else` part does not execute, so the state remains unchanged from the precondition.***
