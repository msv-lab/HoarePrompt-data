The line `at_start = False` updates the value of `at_start` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`sep` is ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` must have at least 2 elements, the second element of `args` is `x`; the standard output contains the string representation of the second element in `args` followed by a space.**
