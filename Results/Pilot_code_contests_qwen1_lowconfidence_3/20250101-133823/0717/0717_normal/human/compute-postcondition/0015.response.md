`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is a space) to the standard output (`file` is `sys.stdout`). The value of `sep` is replaced by the string written to the standard output. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least 3 elements, the third element of `args` is `x`, the standard output contains the string representation of the third element in `args` followed by a space**
