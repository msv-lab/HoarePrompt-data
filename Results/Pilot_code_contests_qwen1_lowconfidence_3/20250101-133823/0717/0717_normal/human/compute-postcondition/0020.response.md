The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to `file`, which is `sys.stdout` in this case. Since `kwargs` is not specified, it is assumed that `kwargs` does not contain the key 'end', so `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` will return the default value `\n`. This value is written to `sys.stdout`, which means the standard output will be followed by a newline character.

Output State: **`sep` is ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` is a list of all the arguments provided; the standard output ends with a newline character**
