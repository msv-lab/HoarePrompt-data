`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. Since `file` is set to `sys.stdout`, the string representation of `x` is written to the standard output, which means it will be printed followed by a space. The other variables (`sep`, `at_start`, and `args`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sep` is ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` must have at least 2 elements, the second element of `args` is `x`; the standard output contains the string representation of the second element in `args` followed by a space.**
