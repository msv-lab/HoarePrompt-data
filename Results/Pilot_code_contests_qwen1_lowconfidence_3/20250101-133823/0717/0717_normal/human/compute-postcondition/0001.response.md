The code snippet assigns values to `sep` and `file` from the `kwargs` dictionary. The `pop` method is used to remove and return the values associated with the keys `'sep'` and `'file'`, with default values `' '` and `sys.stdout` respectively. Since no specific values are provided for `kwargs` in the initial state, we consider the default values.

- `sep` is assigned the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, which is `' '` if `'sep'` is not in `kwargs`.
- `file` is assigned the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, which is `sys.stdout` if `'file'` is not in `kwargs`.

Therefore, the output state after executing the code is:

Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`**
