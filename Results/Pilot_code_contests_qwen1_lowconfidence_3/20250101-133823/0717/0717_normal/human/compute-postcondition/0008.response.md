The variable `at_start` is explicitly set to `False`. The other variables (`sep`, `file`, `args`, and `sys.stdout`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`sep` is ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` must have at least 1 element, the first element of `args` is `x`; `sys.stdout` contains the string representation of `x`.**
