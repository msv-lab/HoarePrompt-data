`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is a space) to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). This means a space character is printed to the standard output. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sep` is ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` must have at least 2 elements, the second element of `args` is `x`; `sys.stdout` contains the string representation of the second element in `args` followed by a space.**
