The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The other variables (`sep`, `file`, and `args`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` must have at least 3 elements, the third element of `args` is `x`; and the standard output now contains the string representation of the third element in `args` followed by a space.
