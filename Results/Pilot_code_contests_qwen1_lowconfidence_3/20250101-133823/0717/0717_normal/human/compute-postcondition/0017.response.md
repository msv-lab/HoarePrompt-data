The code writes the string representation of `x` to `file`, which is `sys.stdout`. This action outputs the string representation of `x` followed by a space to the standard output. The `at_start` variable remains `False` since the `if` condition was already checked and did not change its value.

Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least 3 elements, the third element of `args` is `x`, and the standard output now contains the string representation of the third element in `args` followed by a space.**
