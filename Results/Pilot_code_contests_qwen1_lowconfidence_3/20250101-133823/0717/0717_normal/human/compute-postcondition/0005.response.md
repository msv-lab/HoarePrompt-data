`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is `' '`) to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). This operation does not change the values of the other variables. 

Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least 1 element, the current value of `x` is the first element of `args`, a space (' ') is written to `sys.stdout`**
