The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `sep` and `file` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state is: `sep` is ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `True`.

Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`**
