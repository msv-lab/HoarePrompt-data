Postcondition: ***`sep` is ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` must have at least 2 elements, the second element of `args` is `x`; `sys.stdout` contains the string representation of the second element in `args` followed by a space.*** 

Explanation: Since the `else` part is not provided, we consider only the `if` part's postcondition. The `if` condition being `not at_start` implies that the operation (adding a space) will always occur because `at_start` is `False` initially. Therefore, the postcondition remains as specified in the `if` part.
