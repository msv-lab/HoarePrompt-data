The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. Since `file` is set to `sys.stdout`, this will write `str(x)` to the standard output.

Given the initial state:
- `sep` is `' '`
- `file` is `sys.stdout`
- `at_start` is either `True` or `False` depending on the condition
- `args` must have at least 1 element, and the first element of `args` is `x`
- If `at_start` is `False`, a space (`' '` is written to `sys.stdout`)

Since the code writes `str(x)` to `sys.stdout`, and assuming no other conditions or changes affect `at_start`, the only change is in the output to `sys.stdout`.

Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is the final state (either `True` or `False` depending on the condition), `args` must have at least 1 element, the first element of `args` is `x`, and `sys.stdout` contains the string representation of `x`.**
