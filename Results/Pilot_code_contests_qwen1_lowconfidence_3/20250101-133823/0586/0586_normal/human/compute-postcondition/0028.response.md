`cur` is assigned the value of `a - b * k`. The values of `a` and `b` are subtracted and multiplied accordingly, but the specific values are not given. The value of `k` is also not specified. The precondition that `A` must have at least one more element and `B` must have at least one more element remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` must have at least one more element, `B` must have at least one more element, `cur` is `a - b * k`.

Output State: **`A` must have at least one more element, `B` must have at least one more element, `cur` is `a - b * k`**
