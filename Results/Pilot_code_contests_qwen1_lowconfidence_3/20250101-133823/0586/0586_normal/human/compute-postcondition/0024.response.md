The code updates `dp2[x + cur]` to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`. Here, `x` is the key in `dp1` associated with the value `y`, and `dp2[x + cur]` is being updated.

Since the exact values of `y` and `a` are not specified, we denote the new value of `dp2[x + cur]` as the maximum between the current value of `dp2[x + cur]` and `y + a`.

Output State: **`dp1` must have at least two key-value pairs, `x` is the third key in `dp1`, `y` is the value associated with the third key in `dp1`, `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`.**
