The code `B = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a map object. The original values of `n` and `k` are not affected, and `A`, `tastes`, and `calories` remain undefined. After executing the code, `B` will hold the integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a specific integer within its range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); `k` is a specific integer within its range (1 ≤ k ≤ 10); `A` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `B` is a map object containing integers from the input; `tastes` and `calories` are undefined.**
