The code snippet updates the value of `dp2[x + cur]` to be the maximum of its current value and `y + a`. However, since the initial values of `x`, `cur`, `y`, and `a` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot provide specific numerical values for the updated state.

Output State: **`dp2[x + cur]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `y + a`, `x` is the same as the initial value, `cur` is the same as the initial value, `y` is the same as the initial value, `a` is the same as the initial value.**
