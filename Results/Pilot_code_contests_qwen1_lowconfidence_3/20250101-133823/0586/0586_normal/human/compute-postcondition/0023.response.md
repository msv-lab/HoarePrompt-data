According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `dp1`. Specifically, the loop continues as long as `dp1` has at least one key-value pair. At the end of the last iteration, `dp1` must have at least one key-value pair, `x` is the second key in `dp1`, `y` is the value associated with the second key in `dp1`, and `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what happens to `x` and `y` when the loop processes another key-value pair. The key `x` will become the third key in `dp1`, and `y` will be the value associated with this new key.

For the loop to execute one more time, `dp1` must still have at least one key-value pair. Since `x` becomes the third key and `y` is the value associated with this new key, `dp1` will now have at least two key-value pairs (the first and the new third one).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `dp1` must have at least two key-value pairs, `x` is the third key in `dp1`, and `y` is the value associated with this third key. Additionally, `dp2[x + cur]` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`.

State: **`dp1` must have at least two key-value pairs, `x` is the third key in `dp1`, `y` is the value associated with the third key in `dp1`, `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`**
