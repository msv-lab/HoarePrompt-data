The given code `cur = a - b * k` assigns the value of `a - b * k` to the variable `cur`. However, the initial state does not specify the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `k`. Since `A` is a list and `B` is a map object, we know their types but not their contents. We will assume `a` and `b` refer to elements in these structures.

Since the exact values are not specified, we will keep them in terms of their original variables. The output state will include the updated value of `cur` and retain the initial state of `A` and `B`.

Output State: **`A` is a list with at least 1 integer, `B` is a map object with at least 1 integer, `cur` is `a - b * k`**
