The code `dp2 = dp1.copy()` creates a copy of the dictionary `dp1` and assigns it to `dp2`. The value of `cur` is `a - b * k`, and the lists `A` and map object `B` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a list with at least 1 integer, `B` is a map object with at least 1 integer, `cur` is `a - b * k`, `dp2` is a copy of `dp1`**
