Output State: **`dp1` is a dictionary where the keys are integers formed by adding each `cur` value from the loop to the keys in the initial `dp1` dictionary, and the values are the maximum values obtained from the original `dp1` and the updated values based on the formula `y + a` for all processed key-value pairs in `dp1`; `cur` is the final value of `a - b * k` after the loop completes, `A` is the same as the initial list, `B` is the same as the initial map object.**
