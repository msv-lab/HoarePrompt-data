Functionality: **The function `func()` takes two positive integers `n` and `k` (with \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10\)), along with two lists `A` and `B` of integers, each containing `n` elements (where each element ranges from 1 to 100). The function constructs a dynamic programming table `dp1` to find the maximum taste value that can be achieved by selecting fruits under the given constraints. For each fruit, it calculates a modified taste value `cur` as `a - b * k`, where `a` and `b` are the taste and calorie values of the current fruit, respectively. The function then updates `dp1` by considering all possible combinations of previously accumulated values and the new `cur` values. After processing all fruits, the function checks if the value at `dp1[0]` is greater than 0. If so, it prints the maximum taste value; otherwise, it prints -1. Potential edge cases include scenarios where no valid combination of fruits can achieve a positive taste value, and the function handles these by printing -1.**
