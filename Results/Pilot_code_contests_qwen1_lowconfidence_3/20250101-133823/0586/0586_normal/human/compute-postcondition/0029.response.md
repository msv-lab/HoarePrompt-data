`dp2` is assigned the value of `dp1.copy()`. This means that `dp2` is a copy of the current value of `dp1`, but the original values of `A`, `B`, and `cur` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`A` must have at least one more element, `B` must have at least one more element, `cur` is `a - b * k`, `dp2` is a copy of `dp1`**
