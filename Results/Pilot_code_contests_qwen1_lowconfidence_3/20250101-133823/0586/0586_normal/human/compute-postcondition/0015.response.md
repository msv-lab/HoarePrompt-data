The line `dp1 = dp2` assigns the dictionary `dp2` to the variable `dp1`. This means that `dp1` now refers to the same dictionary as `dp2`, and the contents of `dp1` are updated to match those of `dp2`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`dp1` is a dictionary where each key is the result of adding `cur` to the corresponding key in `dp2` and the value is the maximum of the original value in `dp2` and `y + a` for all processed key-value pairs in `dp2`, `cur` is the same as the initial value `a - b * k`, `A` is the same as the initial list, `B` is the same as the initial map object.**
