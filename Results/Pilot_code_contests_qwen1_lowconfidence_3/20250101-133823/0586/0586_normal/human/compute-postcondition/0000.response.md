`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This means that `n` and `k` are now specific integers within their given ranges (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10), but their exact values are not specified in the initial state. The two lists of integers (tastes and calories) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are specific integers within their given ranges (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10); the two lists of integers (tastes and calories) are not defined**
