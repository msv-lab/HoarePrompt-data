`pos` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `n`, `k`, `A`, `B`, `tastes`, `calories`, and `dp1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a specific integer within its range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); `k` is a specific integer within its range (1 ≤ k ≤ 10); `A` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `B` is a map object containing integers from the input; `tastes` and `calories` are undefined; `dp1` is a defaultdict with the key `(0)` set to `0`; `pos` is `0`.

Output State: **`n` is a specific integer within its range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); `k` is a specific integer within its range (1 ≤ k ≤ 10); `A` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `B` is a map object containing integers from the input; `tastes` and `calories` are undefined; `dp1` is a defaultdict with the key `(0)` set to `0`; `pos` is `0`.**
