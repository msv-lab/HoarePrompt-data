The code `A = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `A`. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The initial values of `tastes` and `calories` lists are not defined and will remain undefined.

Output State: **`n` is a specific integer within its range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); `k` is a specific integer within its range (1 ≤ k ≤ 10); `A` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `tastes` and `calories` are undefined.**
