Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `dp1` must have at least one key-value pair.
   - `x` is the first key in `dp1`.
   - `y` is the value associated with the first key in `dp1`.
   - `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each key-value pair in `dp1` using `for (x, y) in dp1.iteritems():`.

3. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - For the loop to continue, `dp1` must still have at least one key-value pair.
   - After processing the first key-value pair, `dp1` will no longer have `x` as the first key.
   - The next key-value pair will be taken, making the new first key as `x'` and the value associated with this new first key as `y'`.
   - The state of `dp2` will be updated based on `x'` and `y'`.

4. **Updated States for Next Iteration:**
   - `dp1` must still have at least one key-value pair.
   - `x` will now be the second key in `dp1`.
   - `y` will now be the value associated with this new first key in `dp1`.
   - The state of `dp2` will be updated based on `x` and `y` according to the rule `dp2[x + cur] = max(dp2[x + cur], y + a)`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `dp1` must still have at least one key-value pair.
- `x` is the second key in `dp1`.
- `y` is the value associated with the second key in `dp1`.

**State: **`dp1` must have at least one key-value pair, `x` is the second key in `dp1`, `y` is the value associated with the second key in `dp1`, `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`**.
