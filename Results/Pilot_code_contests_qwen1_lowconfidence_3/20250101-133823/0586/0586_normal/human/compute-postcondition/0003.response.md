The code initializes `dp1` as a default dictionary with the key `(0)` set to `0`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `A`, `B`, `tastes`, or `calories`. Therefore, the only change is in the definition of `dp1`.

Output State: **`n` is a specific integer within its range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); `k` is a specific integer within its range (1 ≤ k ≤ 10); `A` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `B` is a map object containing integers from the input; `tastes` and `calories` are undefined; `dp1` is a defaultdict with the key `(0)` set to `0`.**
