The code updates `dp2[x + cur]` to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`. This means that `dp2[x + cur]` will now hold the larger value between its current value and `y + a`.

- `x_next` will be processed in the next iteration with its corresponding `y_next`.
- The value of `dp2[x_next + cur]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `y_next + a`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`, `x_next` will be processed in the next iteration with its corresponding `y_next`**
