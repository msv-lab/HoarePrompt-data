The given code snippet updates the value of `dp2[x + cur]` to be the maximum of its current value and `y + a`. However, since the initial values of `x`, `cur`, `y`, and `a` are not provided, we can only state that `dp2[x + cur]` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`.

Output State: **`dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`.**
