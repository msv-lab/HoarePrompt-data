Output State: **`dp2` contains all key-value pairs where the key is calculated as `x + cur` for each key `x` in `dp1` and the value is the maximum of the current value of `dp2` at that key and `y + a` for the corresponding value `y` in `dp1`. `cur` is `a - b * k`, `dp1` is a copy of the initial `dp1`, `A` is the same as the initial list, `B` is the same as the initial map object.**
