The code `dp1 = dp2` simply assigns the dictionary `dp2` to the variable `dp1`. This means that `dp1` now references the same dictionary as `dp2`. However, the contents of the dictionaries themselves do not change; they remain as they were before the assignment.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the following details:

- `dp1` now refers to the same dictionary as `dp2`.
- `dp2` contains all key-value pairs where the key is calculated as `x + cur` for each key `x` in `dp1` and the value is the maximum of the current value of `dp2` at that key and `y + a` for the corresponding value `y` in `dp1`.
- `cur` is `a - b * k`.
- `dp1` is a copy of the initial `dp1`.
- `A` is the same as the initial list.
- `B` is the same as the initial map object.

Output State: **`dp1` now refers to the same dictionary as `dp2`; `dp2` contains all key-value pairs where the key is calculated as `x + cur` for each key `x` in `dp1` and the value is the maximum of the current value of `dp2` at that key and `y + a` for the corresponding value `y` in `dp1`; `cur` is `a - b * k`; `dp1` is a copy of the initial `dp1`; `A` is the same as the initial list; `B` is the same as the initial map object.**
