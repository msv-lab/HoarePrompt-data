Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `y + a`.
   - `x` is the same as the initial value.
   - `cur` is the same as the initial value.
   - `y` is the same as the initial value.
   - `a` is the same as the initial value.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for (x, y) in dp1.iteritems():
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each key-value pair `(x, y)` in `dp1`.
   - Each iteration updates `dp2[x + cur]` based on the values of `y` and `a`.

4. **State Adjustment for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is processing key-value pairs from `dp1`, the values of `x` and `y` change with each iteration.
   - However, the question asks for the state adjustment at the start of the next iteration of the loop, assuming we are processing the next key-value pair in `dp1`.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `x` and `y` will change to the next key-value pair in `dp1`.
   - `cur`, `a`, and `dp2[x + cur]` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

- `x` and `y` will be the next key-value pair from `dp1`.
- `cur`, `a`, and `dp2[x + cur]` will remain the same as the end of the previous iteration.

**State:**
- `x` and `y` will be the next key-value pair from `dp1`.
- `cur` is the same as the initial value.
- `a` is the same as the initial value.
- `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `y + a` (from the previous iteration).

Given that we do not know the specific next key-value pair from `dp1`, we can represent it as follows:

State: **`x` and `y` will be the next key-value pair from `dp1`, `cur` is the same as the initial value, `a` is the same as the initial value, `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `y + a`.**
