To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the process step by step:

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `dp1` now refers to the same dictionary as `dp2`.
- `dp2` contains all key-value pairs where the key is calculated as `x + cur` for each key `x` in `dp1` and the value is the maximum of the current value of `dp2` at that key and `y + a` for the corresponding value `y` in `dp1`.
- `cur` is `a - b * k`.
- `dp1` is a copy of the initial `dp1`.
- `A` is the same as the initial list.
- `B` is the same as the initial map object.

### Loop Structure:
```python
for (a, b) in zip(A, B):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup**: The loop iterates over pairs `(a, b)` from the lists `A` and `B`.
2. **Update of `cur`**: For each iteration, `cur` is updated as `a - b * k`.
3. **Dictionary Update**: The dictionaries `dp1` and `dp2` are updated based on the current values of `a` and `b`.

### Key Points:
- The loop continues until it runs out of elements in either `A` or `B`.
- Since we are iterating using `zip(A, B)`, both `A` and `B` must have at least one more element to continue the loop.

### Adjusted States:
- `A` and `B` must have at least one more element to continue the loop.
- `dp1` and `dp2` are updated inside the loop but do not affect the loop continuation condition directly.
- `cur` is recalculated for the next iteration based on the new values of `a` and `b`.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
Given the loop structure and the provided states, for the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must hold:
- `A` must have at least one more element.
- `B` must have at least one more element.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `A` must have at least one more element.
- `B` must have at least one more element.

State: **`A` must have at least one more element, `B` must have at least one more element**
