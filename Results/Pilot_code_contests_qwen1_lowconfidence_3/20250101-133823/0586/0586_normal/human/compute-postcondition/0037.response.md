The code `dp1 = dp2` assigns the dictionary `dp2` to the variable `dp1`. This means that `dp1` now references the same dictionary object as `dp2`. The content of `dp2` (i.e., its keys and values) is unchanged, and the `cur` value remains the same. The `dp2` dictionary is updated such that its keys are updated according to the rule `x + cur` and values are the maximum values obtained from the pairs `(x, y)` in `dp1`.

Given the initial state:
- `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `y + a` for all pairs `(x, y)` in `dp1`.
- `cur` remains the same.
- `dp2` is a dictionary.

After executing `dp1 = dp2`, `dp1` and `dp2` point to the same dictionary object. The output state is:

Output State: **`dp2` is a dictionary where keys are updated according to the rule `x + cur` and values are the maximum values obtained; `dp1` points to the same dictionary as `dp2`; `cur` remains the same.**
