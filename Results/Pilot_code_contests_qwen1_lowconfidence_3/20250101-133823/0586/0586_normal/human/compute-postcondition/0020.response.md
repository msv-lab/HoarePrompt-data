`dp2[x + cur]` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `y + a`. The value of `x` is the first key in `dp1`, and `y` is the value associated with the first key in `dp1`. Since `a` is not defined in the initial state, it remains unspecified. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp1` must have at least one key-value pair, `x` is the first key in `dp1`, `y` is the value associated with the first key in `dp1`, `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`**
