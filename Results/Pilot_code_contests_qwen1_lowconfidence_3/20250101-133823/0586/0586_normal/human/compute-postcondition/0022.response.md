The code updates the value of `dp2[x + cur]` to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`. Here, `x` is the second key in `dp1`, `y` is the value associated with the second key in `dp1`, and `cur` is an additional variable that is used in the calculation of the key for `dp2`.

After executing the code, the value of `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp1` must have at least one key-value pair, `x` is the second key in `dp1`, `y` is the value associated with the second key in `dp1`, `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`**
