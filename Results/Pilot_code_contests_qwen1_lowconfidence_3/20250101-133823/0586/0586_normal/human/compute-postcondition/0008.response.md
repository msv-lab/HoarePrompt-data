State before the loop starts: `A` is a list with at least 1 integer, `B` is a map object with at least 1 integer, `cur` is `a - b * k`, `dp2` is a copy of `dp1`.
```
for (x, y) in dp1.iteritems():
    # the loop body is omit
```

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables used in the for loop condition and their initial values:

1. **dp1**: The for loop iterates over the items in `dp1`. For the loop to execute, `dp1` must contain at least one key-value pair.

2. **x and y**: The loop variable `(x, y)` is extracted from `dp1.iteritems()`. `x` is the key and `y` is the value for each iteration. For the loop to start, `dp1` must have at least one key-value pair.

3. **Other variables (`A`, `B`, `cur`, `dp2`)**: These variables are not directly involved in the loop's condition or its execution. They do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute as long as they are correctly defined and initialized.

Given these considerations, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `dp1` must contain at least one key-value pair.

**State:**
**`A` is a list with at least 1 integer, `B` is a map object with at least 1 integer, `cur` is `a - b * k`, `dp2` is a copy of `dp1`, `dp1` must contain at least one key-value pair**
