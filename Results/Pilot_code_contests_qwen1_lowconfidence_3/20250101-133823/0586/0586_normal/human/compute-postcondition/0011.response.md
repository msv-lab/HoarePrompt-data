`dp2[x + cur]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `y + a`. This means that the value of `dp2[x + cur]` is now the larger of its previous value and `y + a`. The values of `x`, `cur`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged. The next iteration of the loop will process the next key-value pair in `dp1`.

Output State: **`dp2[x + cur]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `y + a`; `x` is the same as the initial value; `cur` is the same as the initial value; `y` is the same as the initial value; `a` is the same as the initial value. For the next iteration, the loop will process the next key-value pair in `dp1`.**
