The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10. Additionally, the function takes into account two lists of integers: the first list contains `n` elements representing the tastes of the fruits, and the second list contains `n` elements representing the calories of the fruits, with each value ranging from 1 to 100. The function does not directly return a value from the lists but rather processes them based on `n` and `k`.

Given the output cases are not explicitly stated, we can infer the function likely returns a specific value or set of values based on the processing of the fruit tastes and calories according to the given `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers with specific constraints, and two lists of integers representing the tastes and calories of fruits. It processes these lists based on `n` and `k` and returns a specific value or set of values.**
