`cur` is updated to the value of `a - b * k`. The previous value of `cur` is now replaced by this new value. The states of the other variables (`dp1`, `dp2`, `A`, `B`) are not affected.

Output State: **`dp1` is a dictionary where each key is the result of adding `cur` to the corresponding key in `dp2` and the value is the maximum of the original value in `dp2` and `y + a` for all processed key-value pairs in `dp2`, `cur` is `a - b * k`, `A` is the same as the initial list, `B` is the same as the initial map object**
