#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10. Additionally, there are two lists of integers, each containing n elements: the first list represents the tastes of the fruits, and the second list represents the calories of the fruits, with each value ranging from 1 to 100.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, raw_input().split())
    A = map(int, raw_input().split())
    B = map(int, raw_input().split())
    dp1 = defaultdict(lambda : 0, {(0): 0})
    pos = 0
    for (a, b) in zip(A, B):
        cur = a - b * k
        
        dp2 = dp1.copy()
        
        for x, y in dp1.iteritems():
            dp2[x + cur] = max(dp2[x + cur], y + a)
        
        dp1 = dp2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp1` is a dictionary where the keys are integers formed by adding each `cur` value from the loop to the keys in the initial `dp1` dictionary, and the values are the maximum values obtained from the original `dp1` and the updated values based on the formula `y + a` for all processed key-value pairs in `dp1`; `cur` is the final value of `a - b * k` after the loop completes, `A` is the same as the initial list, `B` is the same as the initial map object.
    if (dp1[0] > 0) :
        print(dp1[0])
    else :
        print(-1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`dp1` is a dictionary where the keys are integers formed by adding each `cur` value from the loop to the keys in the initial `dp1` dictionary, and the values are the maximum values obtained from the original `dp1` and the updated values based on the formula `y + a` for all processed key-value pairs in `dp1`; `cur` is the final value of `a - b * k` after the loop completes, `A` is the same as the initial list, `B` is the same as the initial map object; if `dp1[0]` is greater than 0, the function continues without additional changes. If `dp1[0]` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func()` takes two positive integers `n` and `k` (with \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10\)), along with two lists `A` and `B` of integers, each containing `n` elements (where each element ranges from 1 to 100). The function constructs a dynamic programming table `dp1` to find the maximum taste value that can be achieved by selecting fruits under the given constraints. For each fruit, it calculates a modified taste value `cur` as `a - b * k`, where `a` and `b` are the taste and calorie values of the current fruit, respectively. The function then updates `dp1` by considering all possible combinations of previously accumulated values and the new `cur` values. After processing all fruits, the function checks if the value at `dp1[0]` is greater than 0. If so, it prints the maximum taste value; otherwise, it prints -1. Potential edge cases include scenarios where no valid combination of fruits can achieve a positive taste value, and the function handles these by printing -1.
