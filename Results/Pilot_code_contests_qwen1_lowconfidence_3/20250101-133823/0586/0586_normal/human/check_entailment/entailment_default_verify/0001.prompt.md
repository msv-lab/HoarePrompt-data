You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Dima, Inna and Seryozha have gathered in a room. That's right, someone's got to go. To cheer Seryozha up and inspire him to have a walk, Inna decided to cook something. 

Dima and Seryozha have n fruits in the fridge. Each fruit has two parameters: the taste and the number of calories. Inna decided to make a fruit salad, so she wants to take some fruits from the fridge for it. Inna follows a certain principle as she chooses the fruits: the total taste to the total calories ratio of the chosen fruits must equal k. In other words, <image> , where aj is the taste of the j-th chosen fruit and bj is its calories.

Inna hasn't chosen the fruits yet, she is thinking: what is the maximum taste of the chosen fruits if she strictly follows her principle? Help Inna solve this culinary problem — now the happiness of a young couple is in your hands!

Inna loves Dima very much so she wants to make the salad from at least one fruit.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10). The second line of the input contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) — the fruits' tastes. The third line of the input contains n integers b1, b2, ..., bn (1 ≤ bi ≤ 100) — the fruits' calories. Fruit number i has taste ai and calories bi.

Output

If there is no way Inna can choose the fruits for the salad, print in the single line number -1. Otherwise, print a single integer — the maximum possible sum of the taste values of the chosen fruits.

Examples

Input

3 2
10 8 1
2 7 1


Output

18


Input

5 3
4 4 4 4 4
2 2 2 2 2


Output

-1

Note

In the first test sample we can get the total taste of the fruits equal to 18 if we choose fruit number 1 and fruit number 2, then the total calories will equal 9. The condition <image> fulfills, that's exactly what Inna wants.

In the second test sample we cannot choose the fruits so as to follow Inna's principle.
Program:
```
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    A = map(int, raw_input().split())
    B = map(int, raw_input().split())
    dp1 = defaultdict(lambda : 0, {0: 0})
    pos = 0
    for (a, b) in zip(A, B):
        cur = a - b * k
        dp2 = dp1.copy()
        for (x, y) in dp1.iteritems():
            dp2[x + cur] = max(dp2[x + cur], y + a)
        dp1 = dp2
    if dp1[0] > 0:
        print(dp1[0])
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where all fruits have the same taste and calories such that their ratio does not match `k`. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
5 3
4 4 4 4 4
2 2 2 2 2
```

In this case, all fruits have a taste-to-calories ratio of 2, but `k` is 3. Therefore, it is impossible to select any subset of fruits that would satisfy the condition. However, the program incorrectly outputs `-1`, which is the expected output. 

To verify this, let's run through the logic:
1. For each fruit, calculate `cur = a - b * k`.
2. Update the dynamic programming table `dp2` based on the current fruit's value.
3. Check if `dp1[0]` is greater than 0 before printing the result.

Given the input, all `cur` values are negative, and the program correctly identifies that no valid subset exists, hence the output `-1`.

However, the issue arises when considering cases where the ratio does not need to be exactly `k`, but rather any valid subset needs to be checked properly. The provided solution does not account for scenarios where the ratio might not be achievable due to the constraints, leading to incorrect handling of edge cases. Thus, the program is not fully correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func()` takes two positive integers `n` and `k` (with \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10\)), along with two lists `A` and `B` of integers, each containing `n` elements (where each element ranges from 1 to 100). The function constructs a dynamic programming table `dp1` to find the maximum taste value that can be achieved by selecting fruits under the given constraints. For each fruit, it calculates a modified taste value `cur` as `a - b * k`, where `a` and `b` are the taste and calorie values of the current fruit, respectively. The function then updates `dp1` by considering all possible combinations of previously accumulated values and the new `cur` values. After processing all fruits, the function checks if the value at `dp1[0]` is greater than 0. If so, it prints the maximum taste value; otherwise, it prints -1. Potential edge cases include scenarios where no valid combination of fruits can achieve a positive taste value, and the function handles these by printing -1.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
