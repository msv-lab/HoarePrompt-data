Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the solution for the problem described. Hereâ€™s why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input as specified:
   - The first line contains `n` and `k`, which are split and converted to integers.
   - The second line contains the tastes of the fruits (`A`), and the third line contains their calories (`B`).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The program uses dynamic programming to find the maximum possible sum of the tastes of the chosen fruits while maintaining the required ratio of taste to calories. Specifically:
   - It initializes a dictionary `dp1` to keep track of the maximum taste sum for each possible net difference `(a - b * k)`.
   - For each fruit, it updates the `dp` table by considering the addition of the current fruit to each possible state.
   - This ensures that the program correctly explores all possible subsets of fruits and calculates the maximum possible taste that satisfies the ratio requirement.

3. **Output Generation**: After processing all fruits, the program checks if the maximum taste sum for a net difference of `0` (i.e., `dp1[0]`) is greater than `0`. If so, it prints the maximum taste sum; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

The program correctly handles the constraints and examples provided:
- For the first example, the program outputs `18`, which is the correct maximum taste sum under the given conditions.
- For the second example, the program correctly outputs `-1`, indicating that no valid subset exists.

Given the assumptions that the input is valid and will not cause errors, the program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
