Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where all fruits have the same taste and calories such that their ratio does not match `k`. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
5 3
4 4 4 4 4
2 2 2 2 2
```

In this case, all fruits have a taste-to-calories ratio of 2, but `k` is 3. Therefore, it is impossible to select any subset of fruits that would satisfy the condition. However, the program incorrectly outputs `-1`, which is the expected output. 

To verify this, let's run through the logic:
1. For each fruit, calculate `cur = a - b * k`.
2. Update the dynamic programming table `dp2` based on the current fruit's value.
3. Check if `dp1[0]` is greater than 0 before printing the result.

Given the input, all `cur` values are negative, and the program correctly identifies that no valid subset exists, hence the output `-1`.

However, the issue arises when considering cases where the ratio does not need to be exactly `k`, but rather any valid subset needs to be checked properly. The provided solution does not account for scenarios where the ratio might not be achievable due to the constraints, leading to incorrect handling of edge cases. Thus, the program is not fully correct.
