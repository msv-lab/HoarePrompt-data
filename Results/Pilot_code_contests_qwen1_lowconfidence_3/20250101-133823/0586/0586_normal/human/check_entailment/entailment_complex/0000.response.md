Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input as specified, taking two integers `n` and `k`, followed by lists of `n` integers representing the tastes and calories of the fruits. This matches the problem description perfectly.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a `defaultdict` called `dp1` with a default value of 0 and a base case of `(0, 0)`. This is a standard approach for dynamic programming problems where the initial state is important.

3. **Dynamic Programming Table Update:**
   - The program iterates over each fruit, calculating a modified taste value `cur` as `a - b * k`. It then updates the `dp1` table by considering all possible combinations of previously accumulated values and the new `cur` values. This ensures that the program considers all possible ways to form the desired ratio while maximizing the taste value.

4. **Result Calculation:**
   - After processing all fruits, the program checks if the value at `dp1[0]` is greater than 0. If so, it prints the maximum taste value; otherwise, it prints -1. This correctly implements the requirement to find the maximum possible sum of the taste values of the chosen fruits, ensuring that the ratio condition is met.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no valid combination of fruits can achieve a positive taste value by printing -1. This aligns with the problem description, which specifies that the output should be -1 if no valid combination exists.

6. **Assumptions:**
   - The problem description assumes valid inputs, and the program does not need to handle invalid inputs (like non-lists or non-positive integers), which is acceptable under the given assumptions.

Since the program correctly follows the logic and requirements described in the problem statement, it meets all the criteria and is therefore correct.
