The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the deque `q`. This means the deque `q` now contains one additional element, which is `to`.

Other variables are not affected by this line of code. So, the output state remains as follows:

- `cur` is the first element in the deque `q` after it has been removed.
- `q` is the deque with its first element removed plus the new element `to`.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists.
- `n` is the original input value.
- `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node.
- `to` is the last node added to the deque `q`.
- `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`cur` is the first element in the deque `q` after it has been removed, `q` is the deque with its first element removed plus the new element `to`, `i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, `to` is the last node added to the deque `q`, and `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`.**
