According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `dep[end]`. If `i` is less than `dep[end] // 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `dep[end]` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 so it becomes 2, and `dep[end]` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `dep[end]` must be greater than 2, `center` is the value at index `center` in the list `pred`**
