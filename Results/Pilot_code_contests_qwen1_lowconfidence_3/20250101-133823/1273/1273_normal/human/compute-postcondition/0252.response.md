The code `cur = q.popleft()` impacts the program by assigning the value at the front of the deque `q` to the variable `cur`. Since `q` contains the value `center`, `cur` will be assigned the value `center`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

- `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with a `0` at index `center` and all other elements are `-1`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`.
- `q` is a deque containing the value `center`.
- `cur` is now set to the value `center` (as a result of `q.popleft()`).
- `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`.
- `top` is `center`.

Therefore, the updated values are:

- `cur` is `center`.
- `q` is now a deque without its first element, which was `center`.

The output state is:

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with a `0` at index `center` and all other elements are `-1`, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is a deque without its first element, `cur` is `center`, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`, and `top` is `center`.**
