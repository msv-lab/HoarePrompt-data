The code `end = q.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element of the deque `q`. Since `q` is initially `[0]`, removing the leftmost element results in `end` being assigned the value `0`. After this operation, `q` will be empty.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is 0, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is -1 except for `dep[cur]` which is 0, `to` is undefined (as it was not used in the code), `pred` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is 0, `end` is 0**
