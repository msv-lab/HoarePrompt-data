`e[v]` is updated by appending `u` to the sublist at index `v`. Given the initial state, the sublist at index `v` already contains `[v, v, u, v]`. After appending `u`, the sublist at index `v` will become `[v, v, u, v, u]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `e` is a list of `n + 1` empty sublists, except for the sublist at index `u` which now contains `[v, v, u, v, u]`, `n` must be greater than 3, `u` is an integer input, `v` is an integer input**
