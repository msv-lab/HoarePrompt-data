The code `dep[end] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `dep[end]`. According to the initial state, `dep[end]` must be at least `2 * i + 1`, but now it is explicitly set to `0`. This contradicts the initial condition, so the only valid change is the assignment itself.

Output State: **`dep[end]` is 0, `i` is the final value of `i` after the loop, which is `dep[end] // 2`, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, and `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are `-1` except for `dep[end]` which is `0`.**
