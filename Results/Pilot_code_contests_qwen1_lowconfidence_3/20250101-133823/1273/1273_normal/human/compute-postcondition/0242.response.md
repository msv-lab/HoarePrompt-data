Output State: **`dep[end]` is the shortest distance from `center` to `end`, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is not defined, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`. If `deg[dep[i]] == -1`, then `deg[dep[i]]` is set to `len(e[i])` for each iteration `i` from `1` to `n`. Otherwise, `bad` is set to `True` after the loop terminates.**
