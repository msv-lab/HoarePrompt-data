The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be `dep[cur] + 1`. Given that `dep[cur]` had a specific value before the code was executed, `dep[to]` will now be updated to that value plus one. The variables `cur` and `to` are used to reference elements in the lists `q` and `e` respectively, but their specific values do not change. The state of `q` and `e` remains valid and unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is the next element in `q`, `q` must now contain valid elements, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`**
