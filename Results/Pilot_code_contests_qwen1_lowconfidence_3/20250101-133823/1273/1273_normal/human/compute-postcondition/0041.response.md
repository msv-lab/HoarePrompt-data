Postcondition: ***`cur` is the first element in the deque `q` after it has been removed, `q` is the deque with its first element removed plus the new element `to`, `i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, `to` is the last node added to the deque `q`, and `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`. Otherwise, the conditions remain as they were before the if-else block.***
