State before the loop starts: `cur` is the next node in `q`, `q` is updated by removing the leftmost element, `i` is 0, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, `to` is the last node added to the deque `q`, and every node in the graph that is reachable from node `1` has had its distance correctly set to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the adjacency list of `cur`, meaning there must be at least one neighbor of `cur` in the graph for the loop to execute.

2. **Variables Involved**:
   - `cur`: This is the current node being processed.
   - `e[cur]`: This is the adjacency list for node `cur`.
   - `to`: This variable will take the value of each neighbor of `cur` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element (a neighbor of `cur`). If `e[cur]` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - Since `to` will be set to each neighbor of `cur` during each iteration, we need to ensure that `e[cur]` contains at least one element so that `to` can be assigned to it.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute are:

State: **`cur` is the next node in `q`, `q` is updated by removing the leftmost element, `i` is 0, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, `to` is the last node added to the deque `q`, and `e[cur]` must contain at least one element**.
