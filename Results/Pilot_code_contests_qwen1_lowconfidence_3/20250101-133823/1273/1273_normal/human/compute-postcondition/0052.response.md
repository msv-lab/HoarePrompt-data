The code `cur = q.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the deque `q` and assigns it to `cur`. This means that `cur` now holds the next node that needs to be processed. The state of `q` is updated, removing the first element. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is the next node in `q`, `q` is updated by removing the leftmost element, `i` is 0, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, `to` is the last node added to the deque `q`, and every node in the graph that is reachable from node `1` has had its distance correctly set to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`.**
