`q` appends the value `to` to its end. The value of `cur` remains the first element of `q`, `e[cur]` remains a non-empty iterable, `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`, and `dep[cur]` remains a non-negative integer. 

Output State: **`q` is a non-empty list or iterable with the last element being `to`, `cur` is the first element of `q`, `e[cur]` is a non-empty iterable, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`, and `dep[cur]` is a non-negative integer.**
