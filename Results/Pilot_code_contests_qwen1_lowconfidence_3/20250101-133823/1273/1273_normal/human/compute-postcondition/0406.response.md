The code appends `to` to the list `q`. Based on the initial state, `q` is a non-empty list with its first element removed, `cur` is the first element of the original `q`, `e[cur]` must have at least one element, `dep[cur]` is `v`, and `dep[to]` is `v + 1`. After appending `to` to `q`, the list `q` will have `to` added to it, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is now a non-empty list with its first element removed and an additional element `to`, `cur` is the first element of the original `q`, `e[cur]` must have at least one element, `dep[cur]` is `v`, `dep[to]` is `v + 1`**
