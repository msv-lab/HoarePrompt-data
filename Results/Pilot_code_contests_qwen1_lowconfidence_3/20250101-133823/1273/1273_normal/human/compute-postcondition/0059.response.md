The code updates the `dep` list such that `dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. Given the initial state:

- `cur` is the next node in `q`
- `q` is updated by appending `to` to it
- `i` is 1
- `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph
- `n` is the original input value
- `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node (with `dep[to]` now equal to `dep[cur] + 1`)

After executing `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1`, the distance of node `to` from node `1` is updated to be one more than the distance of `cur` from node `1`.

Output State: **`cur` is the next node in `q`, `q` is updated by appending `to` to it, `i` is 1, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node (with `dep[to]` now equal to `dep[cur] + 1`)**
