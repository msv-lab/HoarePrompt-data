`q` is a non-empty list with its first element removed, meaning the first element of `q` is now `cur`. The variable `cur` holds the value of the first element of the original `q` before the first element was removed. The variable `to` is referenced in the code, but its value is not specified. After executing `q.append(to)`, the list `q` is modified by appending `to` to it.

Output State: **`q` is a non-empty list with its first element removed and appended with `to`; `cur` is the first element of the original `q`; `e[cur]` must have at least two elements; `dep[cur]` is `v`; `dep[to]` is `v + 1`.**
