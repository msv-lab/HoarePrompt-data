The code initializes a list of lists `e` where the number of sublists is `n + 1`. Since `n` is an integer input from the user within the range of 1 to \(10^5\), `e` will be a list containing `n + 1` empty sublists.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ \(10^5\); `e` is a list of `n + 1` empty sublists**
