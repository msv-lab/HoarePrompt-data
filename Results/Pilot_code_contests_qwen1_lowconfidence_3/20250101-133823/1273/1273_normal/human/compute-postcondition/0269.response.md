The code `top = to` assigns the value of `to` to the variable `top`. This does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with a `0` at index `center` and all other elements are `-1`, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the next `to` from `e[cur]`, `q` is updated based on the loop body, `top` is now equal to `to`.
