Output State: **`q` is a non-empty list containing all nodes reachable from `cur` in the graph, `cur` is the first element of the original `q`, `e[cur]` is the adjacency list of `cur`, `dep` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is the depth level from `cur`, and `dep[cur]` is 0.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `q` is a non-empty list with its first element removed.
   - `cur` is the first element of the original `q`.
   - `e[cur]` is the adjacency list of `cur`.
   - `dep` is a dictionary initialized such that all values are `-1`, indicating unvisited nodes.
   - `dep[cur]` is `0` since `cur` is the starting point.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each neighbor `to` of the current node `cur`.
   - If `dep[to]` is `-1`, it means the node `to` is unvisited. The depth of `to` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` (since it is visited through `cur`).
   - The node `to` is appended to `q`.

3. **Post-loop State**:
   - After the loop completes, `q` will contain all nodes reachable from `cur` in the graph.
   - Each node `to` in `q` will have its depth recorded in `dep[to]` correctly.
   - `cur` remains the first element of the original `q`.
   - `dep[cur]` will always be `0` since `cur` is the root node.

4. **Case When Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If `e[cur]` is empty (no neighbors for `cur`), the loop will not execute at all, and `q` will still be a non-empty list with the first element removed.
   - `cur` will be the first element of the original `q`.
   - `dep[cur]` will be `0`, and `dep[to]` for any `to` will still be `-1` since they were never visited.

Thus, the final state after the loop completes (or does not execute) is that `q` contains all reachable nodes from `cur`, `cur` is the first element of the original `q`, and `dep` records the correct depths of all visited nodes from `cur`.
