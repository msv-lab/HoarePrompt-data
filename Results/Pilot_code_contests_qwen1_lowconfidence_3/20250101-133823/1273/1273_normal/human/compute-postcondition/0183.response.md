`q` is a deque that appends `to` to its right side. The previous value of `q` was a deque containing `to`, `to_new`, and `to` (or `to` and `to_new`). After appending `to`, the new value of `q` will be a deque containing `to_new`, `to`, `to`, or `to_new`, `to`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `dep[end]` is 0, `i` is 0, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is a deque containing `to_new`, `to`, `to`, or `to_new`, `to`, `cur` is the next neighbor of `end`, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1**
