The code initializes a list `deg` with `-1` for each element from `0` to `n`. This operation does not affect the values of `dep[end]`, `i`, `center`, `q`, `cur`, or the contents of `e[cur]` for any `cur`.

Output State: **`dep[end]` is the shortest distance from `center` to `end`, `i` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is not defined since the loop has finished, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`, and for every node `to` in `e[cur]` during the loop, `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` for each `to` such that `dep[to]` was initially `-1`.**
