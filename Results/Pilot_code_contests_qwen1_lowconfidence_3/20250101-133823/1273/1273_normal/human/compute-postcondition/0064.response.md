The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. The variable `to` represents a neighbor of `cur`, which means it is a node connected to the current node `cur` in the graph. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`cur` is the next node in `q`, `q` contains at least one element (a neighbor of `cur`) plus the new element `to`, `i` is 2, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, and `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.**
