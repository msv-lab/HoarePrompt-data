Postcondition: ***`q` is non-empty, `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` after processing the current `to`; if `dep[to] == -1` and `len(e[to]) == 2`, then `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1` and `e[cur]` contains at least one element with the first element being `to`. If `dep[to] == -1` and `len(e[to]) == 1`, then `e[cur]` contains at least one element and the first element is `to`. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged with `q` being non-empty and `e[cur]` containing at least one element.***
