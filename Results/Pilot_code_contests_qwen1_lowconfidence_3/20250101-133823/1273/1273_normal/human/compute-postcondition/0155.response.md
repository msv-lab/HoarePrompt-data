Postcondition: **`i` is `n + 1`, `bad` remains `False`, `deg[dep[i]]` is updated for each `i` from 1 to `n` if necessary, `i` is the only variable that changes with each iteration, and `end` remains the last node added to `q`, `dep` remains a list of length \(n + 1\) representing the shortest distances, `pred` remains a list of length \(n + 1\) representing the predecessors, `cur` remains the last node processed, `e` remains a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `deg` remains a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is updated if necessary, and `bad` remains `False` since the condition `(not bad)` is true.**
