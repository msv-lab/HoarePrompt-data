The code `pred[to] = end` updates the `pred[to]` variable to be equal to `end`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`end` is the value that was at the front of the queue `q` before calling `popleft`, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[end] + 1`, `pred[to]` is set to `end`, `q` now contains all its previous elements plus `to`, and `e[end]` must contain at least one element.**
