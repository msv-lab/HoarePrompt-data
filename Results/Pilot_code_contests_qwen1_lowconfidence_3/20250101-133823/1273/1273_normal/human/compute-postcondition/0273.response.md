Postcondition: ***`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with a `0` at index `center` and all other elements are `-1`. `i` is `n`. `cur` is the next `to` from `e[cur]`. `q` and `top` are updated as follows: if `len(e[to]) == 2`, then `q` is `[-1]` and `top` is updated based on the loop body. Otherwise, if `len(e[to]) == 1`, then `q` is an empty list and `top` is equal to `to`. Otherwise, `q` and `top` remain unchanged from their preconditions.***
