Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `deg[dep[1]]` is either equal to the length of `e[1]` or not equal to -1
     - If `deg[dep[1]]` is not equal to -1, then `bad` is set to `True` if `deg[dep[1]]` is not equal to the length of `e[1]`.
     - Otherwise, `bad` remains unchanged.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue if `i` is less than `n + 1`.
   - Given that `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must become 2.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `deg[dep[1]]` remains the same as it was not modified inside the loop body.
   - `bad` also remains the same unless the loop body changes its value, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume `bad` stays as it was.

Given this reasoning, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `deg[dep[1]]` is either equal to the length of `e[1]` or not equal to -1, `bad` remains unchanged**.
