Output State: **`dep[end]` is the shortest distance from `center` to `end`, `i` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is a deque containing nodes that need to be processed, `cur` is the current node being processed, and for each node `to` in `e[cur]`, if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, it is now updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop updates the `dep` array to store the shortest distance from `center` to each node.
- The `q` deque is used to process nodes level by level.
- `cur` keeps track of the current node being processed.
- Once the loop finishes, `dep[end]` will hold the shortest distance from `center` to `end`.
- The loop continues until all nodes reachable from `center` have been processed, updating their distances in the `dep` array.
