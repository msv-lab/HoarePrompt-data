Postcondition: ***`q` is a list with elements `[cur, to, to]`, `cur` is the first element of `q`, `e[cur]` is a non-empty iterable with at least one element, `dep[cur]` remains a non-negative integer, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.*** 

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided, we only consider the if part. The if condition checks whether `dep[to]` is equal to -1. If true, the postcondition for the if part is directly applied, which means `q` is updated to `[cur, to, to]`, and `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`. Given that there is no else part, this is the overall postcondition for the entire if-else block.
