The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the deque `q`. Since `q` was initially an empty deque, appending `to` means `q` now contains `to`.

The values of the other variables (`total`, `dep[end]`, `i`, `center`, `q`, `cur`, `dep[to]`, and `e[cur]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `dep[end]` is 0, `i` is 0, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is a deque containing `to`, `cur` is `end`, `dep[to]` is 1, and `e[cur]` must be non-empty.**
