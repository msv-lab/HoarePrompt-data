`cur` is assigned the value of the element that was removed from the left side of the queue `q` using the `popleft()` method. The state of `q` changes to exclude this element. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is not empty, but does not contain the first element it previously held; `cur` holds the value of that first element.

Output State: **`q` is not empty, but does not contain its first element; `cur` is the first element of `q` before the operation**
