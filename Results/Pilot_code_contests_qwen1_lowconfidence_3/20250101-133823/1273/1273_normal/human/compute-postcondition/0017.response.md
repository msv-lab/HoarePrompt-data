The code initializes a deque `q` with the value `1`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `e`, `n`, or `dep`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the deque `q`.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists where each sublist at index `u` contains all `v` such that there is a bidirectional edge between `u` and `v`, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to `-1` except for `dep[1]` which is now `0`, `q` is a deque containing `[1]`.**
