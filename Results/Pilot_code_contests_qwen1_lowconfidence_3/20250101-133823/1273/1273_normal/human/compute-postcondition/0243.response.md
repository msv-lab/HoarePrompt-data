Postcondition: ***`dep[end]` is the shortest distance from `center` to `end`, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is not defined, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`. For each iteration `i` from `1` to `n`, if `deg[dep[i]] == -1`, then `deg[dep[i]]` is set to `len(e[i])`. The condition `(not bad)` is satisfied after the loop terminates.***
