`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. The previous value of `dep[cur]` is a non-negative integer since `dep[cur]` is initialized (implied from the precondition that `dep[to]` is equal to -1, which implies `cur` has already been processed). The value of `dep[to]` is now `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`q` is a non-empty list or iterable containing at least one element, `cur` is the first element of `q`, `e[cur]` is a non-empty iterable, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`, and `dep[cur]` is a non-negative integer.**
