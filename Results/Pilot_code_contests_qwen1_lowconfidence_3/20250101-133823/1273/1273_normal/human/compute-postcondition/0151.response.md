The `break` statement does not change the values of variables but rather breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 3, `deg[dep[1]]` remains unchanged, `bad` is True**
