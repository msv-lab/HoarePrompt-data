Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `q` is a deque containing all nodes reachable from `cur` starting with `end`, `cur` is the last node added to `q`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element represents the shortest distance from `cur` to the corresponding node, `dep[cur]` is 0, `to` is undefined, `pred` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element represents the predecessor of the corresponding node in the shortest path tree, `pred[cur]` is 0, and `end` is the last node added to `q`.**

### Explanation:
- **`total`**: Always remains 0 since it is not used in the loop.
- **`i`**: Increments by 1 each time the loop runs, eventually reaching `n`.
- **`q`**: Contains all nodes reachable from `cur` starting with `end`. It is a deque that initially starts empty but gets populated as the loop runs.
- **`cur`**: The last node added to `q`.
- **`e`**: Remains unchanged as it is the adjacency list of the graph.
- **`n`**: Remains the original input value.
- **`dep`**: Each element represents the shortest distance from `cur` to the corresponding node. Initially, all elements are -1 except for `dep[cur]` which is 0. As the loop runs, distances are updated.
- **`to`**: Undefined as it is not defined in the loop.
- **`pred`**: Each element represents the predecessor of the corresponding node in the shortest path tree. Initially, all elements are 0. As the loop runs, predecessors are updated.
- **`end`**: The last node added to `q`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0):
- **`total`**: 0
- **`i`**: 0
- **`q`**: Empty deque
- **`cur`**: 0
- **`e`**: List of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph
- **`n`**: Original input value (0)
- **`dep`**: List of length \(n + 1\) where each element is -1 except for `dep[cur]` which is 0
- **`to`**: Undefined
- **`pred`**: List of length \(n + 1\) where each element is 0
- **`end`**: 0
