The code initializes a list `deg` with the value `-1` for each index from `0` to `n`. This means that the `deg` list is updated, but no other variables are affected. 

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last node added to `q` (initially `cur`), `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting node to the corresponding node, `pred` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element represents the predecessor of the corresponding node in the shortest path tree, `cur` is the last node that was processed, `i` is `n`, `e` remains a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, and `deg` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is `-1`.**
