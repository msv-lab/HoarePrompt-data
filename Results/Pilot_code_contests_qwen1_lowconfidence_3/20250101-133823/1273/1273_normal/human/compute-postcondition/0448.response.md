The code `break` does not change any variable values. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code, the execution simply ends here. Therefore, the variables `i`, `n`, and `bad` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is True**
