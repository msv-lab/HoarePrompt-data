`q` appends the value of `to` to itself. The previous values of the variables are: `cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` now contains its first element plus the next element from `e[cur]`, `e[cur]` must have at least one element remaining, and `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`. After appending `to` to `q`, the new value of `q` includes the previously mentioned elements plus `to`.

Output State: **`cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` now contains its first element plus the next element from `e[cur]` plus `to`, `e[cur]` must have at least one element remaining, and `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`**
