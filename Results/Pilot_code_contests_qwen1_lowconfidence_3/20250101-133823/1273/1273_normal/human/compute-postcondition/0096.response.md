`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[end] + 1`. The value of `end` is the value that was at the front of the queue `q` before calling `popleft`, and `dep[end]` must contain at least one element. The node `to` is currently not visited, indicated by `dep[to]` being -1. After executing the code, `dep[to]` will be updated to `dep[end] + 1`.

Output State: **`end` is the value that was at the front of the queue `q` before calling `popleft`, and `dep[end]` must contain at least one element; `dep[to]` is now `dep[end] + 1`; the node `to` is currently not visited, indicated by `dep[to]` being -1.**
