The code `e[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the sublist in list `e` at index `u`. Since `e` is initialized as a list of \(n + 1\) empty sublists, `e[u]` will be an empty list initially. After appending `v` to `e[u]`, `e[u]` will contain `[v]`.

The values of `i` and `e` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated values are:
- `i` is 0
- `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) empty sublists, with the sublist at index `u` now containing `[v]`
- `u` remains an input integer
- `v` remains an input integer

Output State: **`i` is 0, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) empty sublists with the sublist at index `u` containing `[v]`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer**
