The code `dep[to] = dep[end] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be the value of `dep[end]` plus 1. The variables `dep`, `to`, and `end` are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the output state will be:

- `dep[to]` is now `dep[end] + 1`.
- The values of `dep`, `to`, and `end` are unchanged from their previous values.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 1`, `dep`, `to`, and `end` retain their previous values.**
