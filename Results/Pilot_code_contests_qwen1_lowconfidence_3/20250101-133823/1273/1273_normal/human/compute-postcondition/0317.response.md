Postcondition: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[center]` is `0` and all other elements are `-1` except `dep[to]` which is `0`. `i` is either `n` or `n - 1`. `cur` is the next valid node in `e[cur]` such that `len(e[cur]) == 2`. `q` is a list containing `1` if `len(e[to]) == 2`, otherwise `q` is an empty list or contains the new `to`. `top` is `cur` if `len(e[cur]) == 2`, otherwise `top` is `to`. `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the degree (number of edges) of the corresponding node in the graph represented by `e`.** 

Explanation: In the if part, the value of `dep[to]` changes from `1` to `0`. In the absence of an else part, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition, ensuring that all other variables and their relationships stay consistent.
