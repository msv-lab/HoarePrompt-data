Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cur` is the element that was at the front of `q` before `popleft()` was called.
   - `q` is the original queue with the first element removed and `to` added to the end.
   - `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.
   - If `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, then `dep[to]` is now `dep[cur] + 1`.

2. **Loop Structure:**
   ```python
   for to in e[cur]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each `to` in `e[cur]`.
   - `e[cur]` represents the adjacency list of `cur`, containing all nodes directly connected to `cur`.
   - The loop body (omitted) presumably updates the state for each `to` node.

4. **State Adjustments Needed for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `cur` should change to another node.
   - Since `q` is updated by removing the first element (`cur`) and adding `to` to the end, the next value of `cur` will be the first element of `q`.
   - Therefore, `cur` will be the next element in `q`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `cur` changes to the next element in `q`.
   - `q` remains as the updated queue with the first element removed and `to` added to the end.
   - `e[cur]` must still contain at least one element.
   - `dep[to]` is already updated if it was `-1`, so no further update is necessary for this specific condition.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `cur` changes to the next element in `q`.
- `q` remains as the updated queue with the first element removed and `to` added to the end.
- `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.
- `dep[to]` is already handled if it was `-1`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`cur` is the next element in `q`, `q` is the updated queue with the first element removed and `to` added to the end, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is already updated if it was `-1`**.
