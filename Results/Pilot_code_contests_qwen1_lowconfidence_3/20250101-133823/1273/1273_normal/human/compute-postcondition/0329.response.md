`q.clear()` is called, which means the list `q` is cleared, removing all its elements. Since `q` was not empty before this operation, it is now empty. The values of other variables such as `cur`, `e[cur]`, `dep[to]`, and `top` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`cur` is the leftmost element of an empty list `q`, `q` is empty, `e[cur]` contains at least one element, and the current value of `dep[to]` is -1, the length of `e[to]` is 1; `top` is equal to `to`.**
