Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Current States:**
   - `cur`: The first element in the deque `q` after it has been removed.
   - `q`: A deque with its first element removed and the new element `to` added.
   - `i`: `n - 1`.
   - `e`: A list of \(n + 1\) sublists.
   - `n`: The original input value.
   - `dep`: A list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node.
   - `to`: The last node added to the deque `q`.
   - `dep[to]`: Set to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `e[cur]`, which means it goes through all neighbors of the current node `cur`.

3. **Determine the Next State After the Loop Executes:**
   - The loop will execute for each neighbor of `cur` until all neighbors have been processed.
   - For each iteration of the loop, `to` will be a neighbor of `cur`.

4. **Update the States:**
   - After processing each neighbor `to`, the loop will continue with the next neighbor in `e[cur]`.
   - The state will be updated based on the processing of `to`.

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `cur` remains the same as the current node being processed.
   - `q` remains the deque with its first element removed and the new element `to` added.
   - `i` remains `n - 1` (since this value is not directly affected by the loop).
   - `e` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the original input value.
   - `dep` remains the same for all nodes except `to`, which is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`.
   - `to` will be the next neighbor of `cur` in the next iteration.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`cur` is the first element in the deque `q` after it has been removed, `q` is the deque with its first element removed and the new element `to` added, `i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, `to` is the next neighbor of `cur` in the deque `q`, and `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`.**

In summary, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`cur` is the first element in the deque `q` after it has been removed, `q` is the deque with its first element removed and the new element `to` added, `i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, `to` is the next neighbor of `cur` in the deque `q`, and `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`.**
