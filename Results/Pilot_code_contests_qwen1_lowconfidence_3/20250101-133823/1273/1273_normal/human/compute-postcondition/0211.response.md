The code snippet appends `to` to the list `q`. This affects the list `q` by adding `to` to its end. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`cur` is the leftmost element of the original `q`, `q` is the original `q` with `to` appended, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`.**
