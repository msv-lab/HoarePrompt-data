`cur` is assigned the value of `q.popleft()`. This operation removes and returns the leftmost element from the queue `q`. Since `q` is non-empty, removing an element means `q` now has one less element. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is the leftmost element of `q`; `q` has one less element than before.

Output State: **`cur` is the leftmost element of `q`; `q` has one less element than before.**
