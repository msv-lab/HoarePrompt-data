Postcondition: ***`q` is a non-empty list, `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` after processing the current `to`, `e[cur]` contains at least one element. If `len(e[to]) == 2`, `q` now contains `to` as the last element, and `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`. If `len(e[to]) == 1`, the `break` statement has been executed. Otherwise, no specific changes occur regarding `top` or the `break` statement.***
