The code snippet updates the value of `deg[dep[i]]` to `len(e[i])`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `deg[dep[1]]` equals `-1` (no changes made).
- `bad` retains its original value unless `deg[dep[1]]` is not `-1`.

Since `i` is now 2, the code snippet `deg[dep[i]] = len(e[i])` will execute. The value of `i` is 2, so `deg[dep[2]]` is being updated to `len(e[2])`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `deg[dep[2]]` is `len(e[2])`**.
