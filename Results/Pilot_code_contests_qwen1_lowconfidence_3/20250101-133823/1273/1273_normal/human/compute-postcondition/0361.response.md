The variable `bad` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `i` and `deg[dep[i]]` remain unchanged, and the condition about `deg[dep[i]]` not being equal to the length of `e[i]` remains valid.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to -1, `bad` is True, and `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to the length of `e[i]`**
