`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. Given that `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with a `0` at index `center` and all other elements are `-1`, and `cur` is the next `to` from `e[cur]`, the only change is in `dep[to]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Since `dep[cur]` is `-1` (as all elements except `center` are `-1`), `dep[to]` becomes `-1 + 1`, which is `0`.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with a `0` at index `center`, `0` at index `to`, and all other elements are `-1`, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the next `to` from `e[cur]`, `q` is updated based on the loop body, `top` is updated based on the loop body**
