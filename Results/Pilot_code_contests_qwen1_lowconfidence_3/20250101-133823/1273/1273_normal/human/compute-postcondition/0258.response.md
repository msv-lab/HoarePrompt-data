Postcondition: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with a `0` at index `center` and all other elements are `-1`. `i` is `n`. `n` is a positive integer. `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`. `q` is a deque without its first element. `cur` is `center`. `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`. `top` is `center`. `e[center]` contains at least one element. The current value of `dep[to]` is not `-1`.**
