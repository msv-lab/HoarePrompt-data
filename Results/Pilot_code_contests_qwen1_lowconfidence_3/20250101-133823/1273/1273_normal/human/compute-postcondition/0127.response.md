The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. This affects the list `q` by adding an additional element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a dictionary, `pred[to]` is equal to `end`, `q` contains the next `to` appended, `e[end]` must contain at least two elements, `dep[to]` is now `dep[end] + 1`**
