The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; instead, it exits the current loop or conditional block. Given the initial state, no loops or conditions are directly involved in this snippet of code. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[center]` is `0` and all other elements are `-1`; `i` is `n - 1`; `cur` is the value of the leftmost element of `q` before the operation; `q` is an empty list; `top` is `to`; `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the degree (number of edges) of the corresponding node in the graph represented by `e`; `cur` must have at least one neighbor in `e[cur]`; `dep[to]` is `0`.**
