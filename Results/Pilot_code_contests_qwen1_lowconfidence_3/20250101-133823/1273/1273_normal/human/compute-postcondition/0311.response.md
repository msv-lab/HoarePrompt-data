`q` is appended with the value of `to`. This means that the list `q` now contains at least one element, which is `1`. The value of `to` is `1`, and it was previously in the list `q`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[center]` is `0`, all other elements are `-1`, and `dep[to]` is `1`; `i` is either `n` or `n - 1`; `cur` is the next valid node in `e[cur]` such that `len(e[cur]) == 2`; `q` is a list containing `1`; `top` is `cur` if `len(e[cur]) == 2`, otherwise `top` is `to`; `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the degree (number of edges) of the corresponding node in the graph represented by `e`.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[center]` is `0`, all other elements are `-1`, and `dep[to]` is `1`; `i` is either `n` or `n - 1`; `cur` is the next valid node in `e[cur]` such that `len(e[cur]) == 2`; `q` is a list containing `1`; `top` is `cur` if `len(e[cur]) == 2`, otherwise `top` is `to`; `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the degree (number of edges) of the corresponding node in the graph represented by `e`.**
