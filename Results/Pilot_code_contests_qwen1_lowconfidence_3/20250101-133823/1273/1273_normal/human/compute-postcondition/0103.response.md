The code snippet `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. This operation affects the variable `q` by adding `to` to its contents. The other variables (`end`, `dep`, `pred`, and `e`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`end` is the value that was at the front of the queue `q` before calling `popleft`, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[end] + 1`, `pred[to]` is set to `end`, `q` now contains all its previous elements plus `to`, and `e[end]` must contain at least one element.**
