Postcondition: ***`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[center]` is `0` and all other elements are `-1` except `dep[to]` which is `1`, `i` is either `n` or `n - 1`, `cur` is the next valid node in `e[cur]` such that `len(e[cur]) == 2`, `q` is a list containing the new `to`, `top` is `to`, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the degree (number of edges) of the corresponding node in the graph represented by `e`. If `len(e[to]) == 1`, then `q` is an empty list, otherwise `q` contains the new `to`.***
