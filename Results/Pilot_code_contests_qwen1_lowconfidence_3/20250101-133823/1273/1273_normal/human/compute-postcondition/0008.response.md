The code snippet `e[u].append(v)` appends the value `v` to the sublist at index `u` in the list `e`. Since `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) empty sublists, and each sublist at index `u` contains `[v]` and the sublist at index `v` contains `[u]`, appending `v` to the sublist at index `u` will add another element `v` to that sublist.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) empty sublists
- The sublist at index `u` contains `[v]`
- The sublist at index `v` contains `[u]`

After executing `e[u].append(v)`, the sublist at index `u` will now contain both `[v]` and `v`, meaning it will have two elements: `v` and `v`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:
- `i` remains 1
- `e` remains a list of \(n + 1\) empty sublists, except for the sublist at index `u` which now contains `[v, v]`

Output State: **`i` is 1; `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) empty sublists, except for the sublist at index `u` which now contains `[v, v]`**
