Postcondition: ***`q` is a non-empty list with its first element removed and appended with `to`; `cur` is the first element of the original `q`; `e[cur]` must have at least two elements; `dep[cur]` is `v`; `dep[to]` is `v + 1`. If `dep[to]` equals `-1`, then `dep[to]` is set to `v + 1`. Otherwise, no change is made to the state.***
