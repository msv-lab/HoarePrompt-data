Output State: **`i` is `n+1`, `deg[dep[i-1]]` is the length of `e[i-1]` for all `i` from `1` to `n` or not equal to `-1`, `bad` is `True` if any `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to the length of `e[i]` for any `i` from `1` to `n`, otherwise `bad` remains `False`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` starts from `1` and increments until `n`.
   - `deg` is initialized such that all elements are `-1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `i` from `1` to `n`, the loop checks if `deg[dep[i]]` is `-1`.
     - If it is `-1`, `deg[dep[i]]` is set to `len(e[i])`.
     - If it is not `-1`, `bad` is set to `True` and the loop breaks.

3. **Final State After All Iterations**:
   - By the end of the loop, `deg[dep[i]]` will hold the length of `e[i]` for all `i` from `1` to `n` that were encountered in the loop (if they were not already `-1`).
   - `bad` will be `True` if any `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to `len(e[i])` for any `i` from `1` to `n`. Otherwise, `bad` will remain `False`.

4. **If the Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If `n` is `0`, the loop does not execute, and `i` remains `n` (which is `0`), `deg[dep[i]]` remains `-1` for all `i`, and `bad` remains `False`.

This final state ensures that all possible outcomes are covered, including the scenario where the loop does not execute due to `n` being `0`.
