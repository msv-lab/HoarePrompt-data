According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `q` is non-empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, indicating that no more nodes need to be processed. This means that all nodes that were initially in the deque `q` have been processed.

Given that `i` is 0, it indicates that the processing is complete, and there are no more nodes in the deque `q`. For the loop to execute one more time, the deque `q` must contain at least one node.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `q` is non-empty.

Therefore, the state needs to be modified as follows:

State: **`cur` is the node that is currently being processed, `q` must contain at least one node, `i` is 0, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, `to` is the last node added to the deque `q`, and every node in the graph that is reachable from node `1` has had its distance correctly set to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`.**

This ensures that the loop condition `while q:` is satisfied, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
