`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[end] + 1`. This means that the value of `dep[end]` is added to 1 to get the new value of `dep[to]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`end` is the value that was at the front of the queue `q` before calling `popleft`, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[end] + 1`, `pred[to]` is set to `end`, `q` now contains all its previous elements plus `to`, and `e[end]` must contain at least one element.**
