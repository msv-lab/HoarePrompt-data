The code `pred[to] = end` assigns the value of `end` to `pred[to]`. This updates the value of `pred[to]` from whatever it was previously to `end`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`end` is the value that was at the front of the queue `q` before calling `popleft`, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[end] + 1`, `pred[to]` is set to `end`, `q` now contains all its previous elements plus `to`, and `e[end]` must contain at least one element.**
