Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step to determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given State:
- `q` is an empty deque.
- `end` is the last node added to `q` (initially `cur`).
- `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting node to the corresponding node.
- `pred` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element represents the predecessor of the corresponding node in the shortest path tree.
- `cur` is the last node that was processed.
- `i` is `n`.
- `e` remains a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph.
- `deg` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is `-1`.
- `bad` is `False`.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization Check**: The for loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n`, we need to change `i` to `1` to start the loop.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `1 <= i < n + 1`. This means `i` should be in the range from `1` to `n` (inclusive of `1` and exclusive of `n + 1`).

3. **Other Variables**: Other variables like `q`, `end`, `dep`, `pred`, `cur`, `e`, `deg`, and `bad` do not directly affect the loop condition. They might be modified within the loop, but they don't need to be explicitly adjusted to enter the loop.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is changing `i` to `1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1**
