The code `pred[to] = end` assigns the value of `end` to the key `to` in the dictionary `pred`. This updates the dictionary `pred` but does not affect the values of other variables.

- `dep` remains a dictionary.
- `pred[to]` is updated to be equal to `end`.
- `q` still contains the next `to` (appended) as before.
- `e[end]` must still contain at least two elements.
- `dep[to]` is now updated to be `dep[end] + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dep` is a dictionary, `pred[to]` is equal to `end`, `q` contains the next `to` (appended), `e[end]` must contain at least two elements, `dep[to]` is now `dep[end] + 1`**
