The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. This means that `to` is added as an element to the end of `q`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is the leftmost element of `q`, `q` now contains `cur` and at least `to` (specifically, `q` is `cur, to`), `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, the current value of `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, and the length of `e[to]` is 2**
