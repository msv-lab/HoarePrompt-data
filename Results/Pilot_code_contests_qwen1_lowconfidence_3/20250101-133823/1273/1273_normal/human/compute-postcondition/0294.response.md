The code sets `top` to `to`, which means the value of `top` is now `to`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[center]` is `0` and all other elements are `-1`; `i` is `n - 1`; `cur` is the value of the leftmost element of `q` before the operation; `q` loses its leftmost element; `top` is `to`; `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the degree (number of edges) of the corresponding node in the graph represented by `e`; `cur` must have at least one neighbor in `e[cur]`; `dep[to]` is `0` since `dep[to]` was previously `-1` and the current length of `e[to]` is equal to `1`.**
