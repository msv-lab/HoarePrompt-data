The code `cur = q.popleft()` assigns the value that was at the front of the queue `q` to the variable `cur` and removes it from the queue. However, the initial state does not specify what `q` contains or what `cur` was before this operation. 

Given the lack of specific initial values, the only change we can definitively say is made is that `cur` now holds the first element of `q`, and `q` no longer has this first element.

Output State: **`cur` is the first element of `q`; `q` does not contain its first element.**
