The code snippet `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the deque `q`. Given the initial state, the value of `to` is known, but since `to` is not explicitly defined, we assume it holds a specific value that was previously set. However, the exact value of `to` is not specified in the initial state. 

Let's denote the initial state as follows:
- `total` is 0
- `dep[end]` is 0
- `i` is 0
- `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`
- `q` is a deque containing `to` and `to_new`
- `cur` is `end`
- `dep[to]` is 1

After executing `q.append(to)`, the deque `q` will now contain `to`, `to_new`, and `to` again.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `dep[end]` is 0, `i` is 0, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is a deque containing `to`, `to_new`, and `to`, `cur` is `end`, and `dep[to]` is 1.**
