Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `dep[end]` is 0, `i` is 0, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is a deque containing `to`, `to_new`, and `to`, `cur` is `end`, and `dep[to]` is 1, if `dep[to] == -1`. Otherwise, `q` is a deque containing `to` and `to_new`, and `cur` is `end`.***
