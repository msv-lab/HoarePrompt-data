Postcondition: ***`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[center]` is `0` and all other elements are `-1` except `dep[to]` which is `1`, `i` is either `n` or `n - 1`, `cur` is either the value of the second leftmost element of `q` or the leftmost element of `q` before the operation, `q` is either an empty list or has one more element which is `to`, `top` is either the node that was most recently updated and set as the new top node during the loop execution or `to`, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the degree (number of edges) of the corresponding node in the graph represented by `e`, and `cur` must have at least one neighbor in `e[cur]`. If `len(e[to]) == 2`, then `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`. Otherwise, `q` becomes an empty list and `top` is set to `to`.***
