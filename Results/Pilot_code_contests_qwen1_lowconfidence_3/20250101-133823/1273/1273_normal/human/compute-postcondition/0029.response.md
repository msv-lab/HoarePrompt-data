Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `cur` is the first unvisited neighbor of node `1` in the list `e[1]`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) initialized to `-1` except for `dep[1]` which is `0` and `dep[cur]` which is `1`, `q` is a deque containing `cur` and `2`, `to` is `2`, and the function ensures that if `dep[to]` was `-1`, `to` is updated to `2` and added to `q`.***
