The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be `dep[cur] + 1`. Since `dep[cur]` is the distance from node `1` to the current node `cur`, setting `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1` means that the distance from node `1` to the next neighbor `to` of `cur` is one more than the distance from node `1` to `cur`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `cur` is the first element in the deque `q` after it has been removed, `q` is the deque with its first element removed and the new element `to` added, `i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `n` is the original input value, and `to` is the next neighbor of `cur` in the deque `q`.

Output State: **`cur` is the first element in the deque `q` after it has been removed, `q` is the deque with its first element removed and the new element `to` added, `i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, `to` is the next neighbor of `cur` in the deque `q`, and `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`.**
