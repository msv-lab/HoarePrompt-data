The code `break` does not affect the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given initial state, the `break` statement is essentially ignored, and the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `deg[dep[1]]` remains unchanged, `bad` is True**
