To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the for loop, let's break down the given information and follow the steps:

1. **Initial State Information**:
   - `cur` is the leftmost element of the original `q`.
   - `q` is the original `q` with `to` appended.
   - `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.
   - If `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, then `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `to` in `e[cur]`.
   - For each `to` in `e[cur]`, the loop body (omitted) is executed.

3. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `e[cur]` contains at least one element.
   - After appending `to` to `q`, the loop continues with the next element in `e[cur]`.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `to` was one of the elements in `e[cur]`.
   - Since the loop continues as long as `e[cur]` contains at least one element, we need to consider the next element in `e[cur]`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `cur` remains the same as it did not change within the loop.
- `q` now includes the previously appended `to`.
- `e[cur]` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue. The next element in `e[cur]` becomes the new `to` for the next iteration.
- If the next `to` has `dep[to]` initially set to `-1`, then `dep[to]` will be set to `dep[cur] + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`cur` is the leftmost element of the original `q`, `q` is the original `q` with the previously appended `to` and the new `to` appended, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and if `dep[new_to]` was initially `-1`, then `dep[new_to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`.**
