To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition under which the `while` loop continues. The loop continues as long as the deque `q` is not empty.

Here are the key points to consider:

1. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is `n`
   - `q` is a deque containing all nodes reachable from `cur` starting with `end`
   - `cur` is the last node added to `q`
   - `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph
   - `n` is the original input value
   - `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element represents the shortest distance from `cur` to the corresponding node, and `dep[cur]` is 0
   - `to` is undefined
   - `pred` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element represents the predecessor of the corresponding node in the shortest path tree, and `pred[cur]` is 0
   - `end` is the last node added to `q`

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues while `q` is not empty.

For the loop to continue, `q` must contain at least one element. In the current state, `q` contains all nodes reachable from `cur` starting with `end`, and `cur` is the last node added to `q`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `q` must still contain at least one element. Since `cur` is the last node added to `q`, and `q` currently contains all nodes reachable from `cur` starting with `end`, there is no immediate need to adjust the state based on the given information.

However, if `cur` were the only node left in `q` and it was removed during the loop, then `q` would become empty, and the loop would terminate. Therefore, to ensure the loop can continue, `q` should not be empty.

Thus, the state does not need any adjustments beyond ensuring `q` remains non-empty.

**State:**
**`total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `q` must not be empty, `cur` is the last node added to `q`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element represents the shortest distance from `cur` to the corresponding node, and `dep[cur]` is 0, `to` is undefined, `pred` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element represents the predecessor of the corresponding node in the shortest path tree, and `pred[cur]` is 0, and `end` is the last node added to `q`.**
