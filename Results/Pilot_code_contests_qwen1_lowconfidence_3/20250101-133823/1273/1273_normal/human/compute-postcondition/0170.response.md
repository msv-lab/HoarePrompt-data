Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - `dep[end]` is 0.
   - `i` is the final value of `i` after the loop, which is `dep[end] // 2`.
   - `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`.
   - `q` is a deque containing `end`.
   - `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are `-1` except for `dep[end]` which is `0`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `q` is not empty.

3. **Current State Analysis:**
   - Since `dep[end]` is 0, and `i` is `dep[end] // 2`, it means `i` is 0.
   - `center` is derived from `pred` and `dep[end] // 2`, but it doesn't directly affect the loop condition.
   - `q` contains `end`, which is the only element in the deque.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes One More Time:**
   - For the loop to execute at least one more time, `q` must remain non-empty.
   - Currently, `q` contains `end`, so we need to ensure that `q` does not become empty during this iteration.

Since the current state has `q` containing `end`, and there is no indication that `q` would be modified in such a way to remove `end` (as the problem statement doesn't provide details on how the loop body modifies `q`), the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring that `q` remains non-empty after the loop body executes.

However, based on the given information and the loop condition, no changes are necessary to the provided states because the loop will definitely execute at least once since `q` is non-empty right before the loop starts.

**Conclusion:**
No states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time based on the provided information.

**Answer:**
State: **`dep[end]` is 0, `i` is 0, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is a deque containing `end`, and `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are `-1` except for `dep[end]` which is `0`**
