Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `dep[end]` is 0, `i` is 0, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is a deque containing `to`, `cur` is `end`, and `dep[to]` is 1.***

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided, we assume that the only case is when `dep[to] == -1`. Therefore, after the if statement executes, the postcondition will match the conditions specified in the if part.
