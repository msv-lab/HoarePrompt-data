`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. The previous value of `dep[to]` is 0, so the new value of `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `dep[end]` is 0, `i` is 0, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is a deque containing `to`, `to_new`, and `to` (or `to` and `to_new`), and `cur` is the next neighbor of `end`, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1**
