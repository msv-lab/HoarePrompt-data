Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - If `deg[dep[1]]` equals `-1`, no changes are made to any variables.
   - If `deg[deg[1]]` is not `-1`, then `bad` is set to `True` if `deg[dep[1]]` does not equal `len(e[1])`, otherwise `bad` retains its original value.

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis of the Loop Body**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - For each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n + 1`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will check the condition `i < n + 1` to decide whether to proceed to the next iteration.
   - Given that `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer, the condition `i < n + 1` will be true as long as `n > 0`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` is 1 and the loop will continue as long as `n > 0`, the next value of `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop.
   - The values of `deg[dep[1]]` and `bad` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless the loop body modifies them, but based on the given information, no modifications are made unless `deg[dep[1]]` is not `-1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer**.
