According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `dep[end]`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `dep[end] // 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 0.
- `dep[end]` must be greater than 1.
- `center` is the value at index `center` in the list `pred`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `dep[end] // 2`. Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute as long as `dep[end] // 2` is greater than 0. Given that `dep[end]` must be greater than 1, `dep[end] // 2` will be at least 1 (if `dep[end]` is 2 or more).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.
- `dep[end]` remains the same and must still be greater than 1.

The state needs to be adjusted accordingly:

State: **`i` is 1, `dep[end]` must be greater than 1, `center` is the value at index `center` in the list `pred`**
