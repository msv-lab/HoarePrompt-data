The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but indicates the exit from a loop or conditional statement. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement that we can infer from the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep[end]` is the shortest distance from `center` to `end`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is not defined, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`, `bad` is `True`.**
