Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) initialized to `-1` except for `dep[1]` which is `0`. If `dep[to]` equals `-1`, then `dep[to]` is set to `1`, `q` is a deque containing `to`, and `cur` remains `1`. If `dep[to]` is not `-1`, no changes are made to `dep`, `q`, or `cur`.***
