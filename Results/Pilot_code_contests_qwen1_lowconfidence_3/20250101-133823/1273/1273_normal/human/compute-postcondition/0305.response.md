The code `break` does not change any variable values but indicates the exit from the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement to break out of within the provided code snippet, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[center]` is `0` and all other elements are `-1` except `dep[to]` which is `1`, `i` is either `n` or `n - 1`, `cur` is either the value of the second leftmost element of `q` or the leftmost element of `q` before the operation, `q` is an empty list, `top` is `to`, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the degree (number of edges) of the corresponding node in the graph represented by `e`, and `cur` must have at least one neighbor in `e[cur]`.**
