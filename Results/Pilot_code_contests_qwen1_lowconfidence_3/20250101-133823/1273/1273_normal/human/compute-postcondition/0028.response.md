The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the deque `q`. Based on the initial state, `q` already contains `cur`. The value of `cur` does not change, and the value of `to` is the current value of `dep[to]`, which is `2`.

Therefore, the updated state of `q` is a deque containing both `cur` and `2`.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `cur` is the first unvisited neighbor of node `1` in the list `e[1]`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) initialized to `-1` except for `dep[1]` which is `0` and `dep[cur]` which is `1`, `q` is a deque containing `cur` and `2`, `to` is `2`.**
