Output State: **`cur` is the leftmost element of the original `q`, `q` is the queue after all elements have been processed, `e[cur]` contains the neighbors of `cur`, and `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` for each `to` such that `dep[to]` was initially `-1`. If the loop does not execute, `cur` is the leftmost element of the original `q`, `q` is empty, and `dep[to]` remains `-1` for all `to` in `e[cur]` unless updated within the loop.**
