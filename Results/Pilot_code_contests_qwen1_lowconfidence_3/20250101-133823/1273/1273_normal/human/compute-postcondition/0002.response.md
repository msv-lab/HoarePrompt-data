Let's break down the given scenario step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Initial States**:
   - `n` is an integer input from the user, with the constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) empty sublists.

2. **Understand the For Loop**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `n - 2` (inclusive), as `range(n - 1)` generates values from `0` to `n - 2`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the variable `i` must start at `0` and go up to `n - 2`.
   - The list `e` must have at least \(n + 1\) elements because the loop uses the length of `e` to determine its upper bound.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop runs for `i` from `0` to `n - 2`, we need to ensure that `i` starts at `0`.
   - We need to confirm that `e` has exactly \(n + 1\) elements.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` should be `0`.
- `e` should have \(n + 1\) elements.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:
State: **`i` is 0, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) empty sublists**
