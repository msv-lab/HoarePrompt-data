`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. Given the initial state, `dep[cur]` is `dep[center] + 1`, and since `dep[center]` is `0`, `dep[cur]` is `0`. Therefore, `dep[to]` becomes `0 + 1 = 1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with a `0` at index `center` and all other elements are `-1`, `dep[to]` is `1`, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is a deque without its first element, `cur` is `center`, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`, `top` is `center`, the current value of `e[to]` contains exactly two elements, the current value of `dep[to]` is `-1`.**
