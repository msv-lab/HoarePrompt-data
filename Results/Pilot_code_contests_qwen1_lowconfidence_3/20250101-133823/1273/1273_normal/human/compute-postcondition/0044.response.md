The code snippet `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the deque `q`. According to the initial state, `to` is the next neighbor of `cur` in the deque `q`, and `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`.

After executing the code, the following changes occur:
- `q` is updated by appending `to` to it.
- `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` if it was initially `-1`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:
**`cur` is the first element in the deque `q` after it has been removed, `q` is now the deque with its first element removed and the new element `to` added, `i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, and `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`.**
