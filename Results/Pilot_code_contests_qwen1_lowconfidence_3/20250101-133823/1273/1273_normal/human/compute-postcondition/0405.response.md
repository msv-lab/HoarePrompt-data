`dep[to]` is assigned the value of `dep[cur] + 1`. According to the initial state, `dep[cur]` must have a specific value, let's denote it as `v`. Since `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, after executing the code, `dep[to]` will be updated to `v + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a non-empty list with its first element removed, `cur` is the first element of the original `q`, `e[cur]` must have at least one element, `dep[cur]` is `v`, `dep[to]` is `v + 1`**
