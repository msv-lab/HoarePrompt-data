The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the `dep` variable at index `to` to be one more than the current value of `dep[cur]`. Given that `dep[cur]` is `1`, `dep[to]` will be `2`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `cur` is the first unvisited neighbor of node `1` in the list `e[1]`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) initialized to `-1` except for `dep[1]` which is `0` and `dep[cur]` which is `1`, `q` is a deque containing `cur`, `dep[to]` is `2`.**
