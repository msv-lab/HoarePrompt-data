The code snippet `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. This operation changes the value of `q` by adding `to` to its end. The other variables (`cur`, `i`, `e`, `n`, `dep`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is the next node in `q`, `q` is `q` appended with `to`, `i` is 1, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node (with `dep[to]` now equal to `dep[cur] + 1`)**
