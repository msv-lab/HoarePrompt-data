The code updates the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1`. Given the initial conditions:

- `q` is a non-empty list with its first element removed and appended with `to`.
- `cur` is the first element of the original `q`.
- `e[cur]` must have at least two elements.
- `dep[cur]` is `v`.
- `dep[to]` is `v + 1` if it was `-1`, otherwise it remains `v + 1`.

After executing the line `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1`, the value of `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`. Since `dep[cur]` is `v`, the new value of `dep[to]` is `v + 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a non-empty list with its first element removed and appended with `to`, `cur` is the first element of the original `q`, `e[cur]` must have at least two elements, `dep[cur]` is `v`, `dep[to]` is `v + 1`**
