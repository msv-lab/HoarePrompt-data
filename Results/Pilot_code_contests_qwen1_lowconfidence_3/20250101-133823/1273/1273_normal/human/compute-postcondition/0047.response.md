The code updates `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1`. Since `dep[cur]` was previously updated from `-1` to some positive value (let's denote this value as `value`), `dep[to]` is now set to `value + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is the new element that was added to the deque `q` after removing the previous `cur`, `i` is `n - 2`, `to` is the new `cur` for the next iteration, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`, `dep[cur]` is `value + 1` where `value` is the original value that `dep[cur]` was updated to from `-1`.**
