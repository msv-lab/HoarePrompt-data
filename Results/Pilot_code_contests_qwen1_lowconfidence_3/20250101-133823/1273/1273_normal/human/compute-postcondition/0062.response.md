According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cur` and the structure of the list `e[cur]`. The loop iterates over each neighbor (`to`) of the current node (`cur`). At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is the next node in `q`, `q` is updated by appending `to` to it, `i` is 1, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, and if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, then `dep[to]` is now set to `dep[cur] + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must hold:
1. The list `e[cur]` must have at least one element, meaning there is at least one unvisited neighbor of `cur`.
2. `cur` must be the next node in `q` after appending all new neighbors.

Given that `cur` is the next node in `q` and `i` is 1 (indicating we are processing the first node in `q`), for the loop to execute one more time, the next node in `q` should be a neighbor of the current `cur`, and `e[cur]` must have at least one element.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `cur` remains the same since we haven't moved to the next node in `q` yet.
- `q` is updated by appending `to` to it, so `q` will contain the next node to process.
- `i` will increment to 2 as we move to the next node in `q`.
- For the loop to continue, `e[cur]` must have at least one element.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
- `cur` is the next node in `q`.
- `q` contains at least one element (a neighbor of `cur`).
- `i` is 2.
- `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph.
- `n` is the original input value.
- `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node.

State: **`cur` is the next node in `q`, `q` contains at least one element (a neighbor of `cur`), `i` is 2, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node.**
