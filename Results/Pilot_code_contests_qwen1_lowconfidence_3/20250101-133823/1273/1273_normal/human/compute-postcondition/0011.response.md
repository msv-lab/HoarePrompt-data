`u` and `v` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers. The values of `i` and `e` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 3 still holds.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `e` is a list of `n + 1` empty sublists, except for the sublist at index `u` which now contains `[v, v, u]`, `n` must be greater than 3, `u` is an integer input, `v` is an integer input**
