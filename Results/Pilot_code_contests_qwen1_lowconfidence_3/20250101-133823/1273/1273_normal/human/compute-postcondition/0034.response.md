Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, `q` is a deque containing all nodes that are at the maximum distance from node `1`, `cur` is the last node visited, and `to` is the last node added to the deque `q`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `dep[1]` is set to `0`, and all other elements in `dep` are `-1`.
- The loop continues to visit nodes until all nodes are visited, updating the distances in `dep` and adding nodes to `q`.
- Once the loop completes, `dep` contains the shortest path distances from node `1` to all other nodes in the graph.
- `q` will contain all nodes that are at the maximum distance from node `1`, which is determined by the value of `dep`.
- `cur` will be the last node visited, and `to` will be the last node added to `q`.

Since the loop will execute until all nodes are visited and the distances are correctly computed, the final state of the variables will reflect this complete traversal.
