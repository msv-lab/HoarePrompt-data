The code snippet `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]`. Here, `cur` is `1`, so `dep[1]` is `0`. The value of `dep[cur]` is `0`, so `dep[to]` is updated to `0 + 1`, which is `1`.

The initial state is as follows:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists
- `n` is the original input value
- `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) initialized to `-1` except for `dep[1]` which is `0`
- `q` is an empty deque
- `cur` is `1`
- `e[1]` must not be an empty list
- `dep[to]` is `-1`

After the code is executed, `dep[to]` is updated to `1`, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) initialized to `-1` except for `dep[1]` which is `0` and `dep[to]` is `1`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is `1`, `e[1]` must not be an empty list**
