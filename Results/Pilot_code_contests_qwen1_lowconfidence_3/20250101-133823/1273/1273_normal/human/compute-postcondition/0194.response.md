The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be one more than the current value of `dep[cur]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` now contains its first element plus `to`, `e[cur]` must have at least two elements, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`, and `dep[cur]` remains unchanged.**
