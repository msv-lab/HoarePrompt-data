Postcondition: ***`dep[to]` is `-1`, if the condition `dep[to] == -1` is true, then `dep[to]` is set to `dep[end] + 1`, `pred[to]` is set to `end`, `q` contains the value of `to`, and `dep`, `to`, and `end` retain their previous values. Otherwise, the values of `dep`, `to`, `end`, and `q` remain unchanged.***
