The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `deg[dep[1]]`, or `bad`. It simply breaks out of the nearest loop or match case, but no new assignments or changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 3; `deg[dep[1]]` remains unchanged; `bad` is `True`**
