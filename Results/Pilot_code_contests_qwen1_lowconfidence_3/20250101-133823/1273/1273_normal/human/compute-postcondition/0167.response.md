The code initializes a list `dep` with length `n + 1` and all elements set to `-1`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `dep[end]`, `center`, or `pred`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is the final value of `i` after the loop, which is `dep[end] // 2`, `dep[end]` must be at least `2 * i + 1`, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, and `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are `-1`.**
