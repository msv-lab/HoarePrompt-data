According to the code, the loop iterates over each element `to` in the list `e[end]`. For the loop to execute again, `e[end]` must contain at least one element. At the end of the previous iteration, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[end] + 1`, `pred[to]` is set to `end`, and `q` now contains all its previous elements plus `to`. 

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to ensure that `e[end]` still contains at least one element.

Let's break down the information:

- `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[end] + 1`.
- `pred[to]` is set to `end`.
- `q` now contains all its previous elements plus `to`.
- `e[end]` must contain at least one element.

Since `e[end]` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue, and there is no indication that this changes within the loop body (the loop body is omitted), we can assume that `e[end]` will still contain at least one element for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`end` is the value that was at the front of the queue `q` before calling `popleft`, and `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[end] + 1`, `pred[to]` is set to `end`, `q` now contains all its previous elements plus `to`, and `e[end]` must contain at least one element.**
