Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[center]` is `0` and all other elements are `-1`, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the node that was processed last and had its `dep` value updated to the maximum depth possible, `q` is an empty list, `top` is the node that was most recently updated and set as the new top node during the loop execution, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the degree (number of edges) of the corresponding node in the graph represented by `e`.**

Explanation:
- After the loop finishes executing, `q` will be empty because every node that could be in `q` would have been processed and removed.
- `cur` will be the node that was processed last and had its `dep` value updated to the maximum depth possible.
- `top` will be the node that was most recently updated and set as the new top node during the loop execution, which would be the node that was most recently added to `q` and processed.
- `i` will be `n` or `n - 1` depending on whether the loop ran to completion or was prematurely terminated by setting `q` to an empty list.
- `dep` will be updated for all nodes reachable from `center` to their respective depths.
- `deg` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution.
