`q` appends `to` to its list, which means `to` is added to the end of the list `q`. The values of `cur`, `e[cur]`, `dep[to]`, and `dep[cur]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` now contains its first element plus `to`, `e[cur]` must have at least one element, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`, and `dep[cur]` is known but its specific value is not provided.**
