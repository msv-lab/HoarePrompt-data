The code updates the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1`. Based on the initial state, `dep[cur]` is known, but its specific value is not given. The other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` must now contain its first element (the element corresponding to `cur`), `e[cur]` must have at least one element, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`, and `dep[cur]` is known but its specific value is not provided.**
