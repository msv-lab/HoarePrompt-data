`deg[dep[i]]` is updated to `len(e[i])`. Given that `i` is 3, this means `deg[dep[3]]` is set to `len(e[3])`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 3; `deg[dep[3]]` is equal to `len(e[3])`; `deg[dep[1]]` remains unchanged; `bad` is True if `deg[dep[2]]` is not equal to the length of `e[2]`, otherwise `bad` remains unchanged.**
