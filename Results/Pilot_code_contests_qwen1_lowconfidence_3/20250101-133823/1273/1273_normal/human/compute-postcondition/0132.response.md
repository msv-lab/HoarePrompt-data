The code `bad = False` assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `bad`. This assignment does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last node added to `q` (initially `cur`), `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting node to the corresponding node, `pred` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element represents the predecessor of the corresponding node in the shortest path tree, `cur` is the last node that was processed, `i` is `n`, `e` remains a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `deg` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is `-1`, and `bad` is `False`.**
