`q` has its first element removed and then `to` is appended to it. The first element of the original `q` is stored in `cur`. The value of `dep[cur]` is `v`, and the value of `dep[to]` is `v + 1`. After executing `q.append(to)`, the first element of `q` (which was `cur`) is no longer the first element, but `to` is now the last element added to `q`.

Output State: **`q` is a non-empty list with its first element updated to `to`; `cur` is the first element of the original `q`; `e[cur]` must have at least two elements; `dep[cur]` is `v`; `dep[to]` is `v + 1`**
