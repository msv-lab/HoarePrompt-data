`q` appends the value of `to` to itself. The value of `cur` remains the first element of the updated `q`, and `to` is added as the second element. The value of `e[cur]` is not affected by this operation, nor is `dep[cur]` or `dep[to]`. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `q`.

Output State: **`cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` now contains its first element followed by `to`, `e[cur]` must have at least two elements, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`, and `dep[cur]` remains unchanged.**
