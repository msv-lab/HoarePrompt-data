To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition of the loop: `while q:`. This condition checks if the deque `q` is non-empty.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `q` is a deque containing 0.
   - `cur` is 0.
   - `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph.
   - `n` is the original input value.
   - `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is -1 except for `dep[cur]` which is 0.
   - `to` is the last node that was added to the deque `q` if it exists (which in this case does not exist as `q` was just initialized).
   - `pred` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is 0.
   - `end` is 0.

2. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop `while q:` will execute as long as `q` is non-empty.
   - Currently, `q` contains at least one element (0).

3. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - Since `q` already contains at least one element, the loop condition `while q:` is already satisfied.
   - No additional adjustments are needed to ensure that the loop can execute at least once.

### Conclusion:
The state right before the loop is already sufficient to make the loop execute at least once. Therefore, no modifications to the state are required.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `q` is a deque containing 0, `cur` is 0, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is -1 except for `dep[cur]` which is 0, `to` is the last node that was added to the deque `q` if it exists (which in this case does not exist as `q` was just initialized), `pred` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is 0, `end` is 0**.
