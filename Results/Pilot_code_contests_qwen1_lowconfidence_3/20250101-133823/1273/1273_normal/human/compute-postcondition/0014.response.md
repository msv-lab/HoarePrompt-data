Let's analyze the loop step by step based on the provided code and initial conditions.

### Initial State
- `n` is an integer input from the user, where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) empty sublists.

### Loop Code
```
for i in range(n - 1):
    u, v = map(int, raw_input().split())
    e[u].append(v)
    e[v].append(u)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **First Iteration (i = 0):**
   - `u` and `v` are read from input.
   - `e[u].append(v)` adds `v` to the sublist at index `u`.
   - `e[v].append(u)` adds `u` to the sublist at index `v`.

2. **Second Iteration (i = 1):**
   - `u` and `v` are read from input.
   - `e[u].append(v)` adds `v` to the sublist at index `u`.
   - `e[v].append(u)` adds `u` to the sublist at index `v`.

3. **Third Iteration (i = 2):**
   - `u` and `v` are read from input.
   - `e[u].append(v)` adds `v` to the sublist at index `u`.
   - `e[v].append(u)` adds `u` to the sublist at index `v`.

### General Pattern
Each iteration of the loop reads two indices `u` and `v` from input and adds them to each other's sublists in the list `e`. This means that each pair `(u, v)` added to the list will form a bidirectional edge between nodes `u` and `v` in an adjacency list representation of a graph.

### Final State After All Iterations
- The loop runs \(n - 1\) times, meaning \(n - 1\) pairs of nodes are added to the list.
- Each pair `(u, v)` will result in both `u` and `v` having the same neighbors in their respective sublists.
- The original state of `n` and `e` remains unchanged unless inputs are provided.

### Output State After All Iterations

**Output State:**
- `i` is `n - 1` (since the loop runs \(n - 1\) times).
- `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists where each sublist at index `u` contains all `v` such that there is a bidirectional edge between `u` and `v`.
- `n` is the original input value, and it must satisfy \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).

Thus, the final output state is:
**Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists where each sublist at index `u` contains all `v` such that there is a bidirectional edge between `u` and `v`, `n` is the original input value, and it must satisfy \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).**
