Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `cur` is the first element of `q`.
   - `q` contains all nodes reachable from `cur` with the shortest path length recorded in `dep`.
   - `e[cur]` is empty.
   - For every node `to` in `q`, `dep[to]` is the shortest distance from `cur` to `to`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `q` is not empty.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - In each iteration, the first element of `q` (which is `cur`) is processed, and then `cur` is removed from `q`.
   - The shortest path lengths to all nodes in `q` are updated based on the processing of `cur`.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must still contain elements.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop condition is `q`, we need to ensure that `q` is not empty for the next iteration.
   - The state given indicates that `q` currently contains all nodes reachable from `cur` with their shortest path lengths recorded in `dep`.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that `q` is not empty.

**State:**
- `cur` is the first element of `q`.
- `q` contains all nodes reachable from `cur` with the shortest path length recorded in `dep`.
- `e[cur]` is empty.
- For every node `to` in `q`, `dep[to]` is the shortest distance from `cur` to `to`.
- `q` must not be empty for the loop to execute one more time.

However, since the initial state already mentions that `q` contains nodes, we don't need to change this explicitly. We just need to ensure that the condition for the loop to continue is met.

**Final State:**
- `cur` is the first element of `q`.
- `q` contains all nodes reachable from `cur` with the shortest path length recorded in `dep`.
- `e[cur]` is empty.
- For every node `to` in `q`, `dep[to]` is the shortest distance from `cur` to `to`.
- `q` must not be empty.

Since the initial state already ensures `q` is not empty, no additional adjustments are needed beyond stating the requirement for the loop to continue.

**State:**
State: **`cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` contains all nodes reachable from `cur` with the shortest path length recorded in `dep`, `e[cur]` is empty, and for every node `to` in `q`, `dep[to]` is the shortest distance from `cur` to `to`, and `q` must not be empty**
