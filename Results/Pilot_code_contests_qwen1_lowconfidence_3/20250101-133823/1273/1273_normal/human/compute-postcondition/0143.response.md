The code `deg[dep[i]] = len(e[i])` updates the value of `deg[dep[i]]` to be the length of `e[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, the code becomes `deg[dep[2]] = len(e[2])`. Since the initial state says `deg[dep[1]]` remains unchanged and `bad` remains unchanged, only the value of `deg[dep[2]]` changes.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `deg[dep[1]]` remains unchanged, `bad` remains unchanged, `deg[dep[2]]` is `len(e[2])`**
