The `break` statement does not change any variable values but rather breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code, the `break` statement will simply exit the context it was placed in, which could be an implicit context like a function call or an if-else block. However, based on the provided initial state and the absence of any loops or conditional blocks, the only impact is that the execution will exit the current context.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `deg[dep[1]]` remains the same, `bad` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
