According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `deg[dep[1]]` remains unchanged. The variable `bad` is determined based on the condition where `deg[dep[2]]` is not equal to the length of `e[2]`.

Let's analyze the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `deg[dep[1]]` remains unchanged
   - `bad` is True if `deg[dep[2]]` is not equal to the length of `e[2]`, otherwise `bad` remains unchanged

2. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 3.
   - The condition for `bad` will be checked again, but it depends on the values of `deg[dep[2]]` and the length of `e[2]`. Since the problem does not specify new values for these variables, we assume they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `i` will be 3
- `deg[dep[1]]` remains unchanged
- `bad` will be True if `deg[dep[2]]` is not equal to the length of `e[2]`, otherwise `bad` remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is 3, `deg[dep[1]]` remains unchanged, and `bad` is True if `deg[dep[2]]` is not equal to the length of `e[2]`, otherwise `bad` remains unchanged**.
