The code `dep[to] = dep[end] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be one more than the current value of `dep[end]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`end` is the value that was at the front of the queue `q` before calling `popleft`, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[end] + 1`, `pred[to]` is set to `end`, `q` now contains all its previous elements plus `to`, and `e[end]` must contain at least one element.**
