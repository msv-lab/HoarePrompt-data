The code initializes a list `pred` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of any other variables.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` is an empty list, `cur` is the last node processed, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is -1, `to` is the last node that was added to the deque `q` if it exists, and `pred` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is 0.**
