The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be one more than the current value of `dep[cur]`. The values of `q`, `cur`, and `e[cur]` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`q` is non-empty, `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` after processing the current `to`, `e[cur]` contains at least one element, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`**
