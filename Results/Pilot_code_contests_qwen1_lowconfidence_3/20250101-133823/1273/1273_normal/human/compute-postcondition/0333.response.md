Postcondition: ***`cur` is the leftmost element of `q`, `q` is not empty, `e[cur]` contains at least one element. If `dep[to]` is initially `-1`, then either `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` (if `len(e[to]) == 2`) or remains `-1` (if `len(e[to]) != 2`). If `len(e[to]) == 1`, then `top` is set to `to` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.***
