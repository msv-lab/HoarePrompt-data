Output State: **`dep` is a dictionary where each key represents a node and the value is the shortest distance from the starting node; `pred` is a dictionary where each key represents a node and the value is its predecessor in the shortest path; `q` is a queue of nodes to be processed, initially containing all nodes with `dep` value of -1; every node in `q` has been processed and its `dep` and `pred` values are correctly updated based on the shortest path algorithm.**
