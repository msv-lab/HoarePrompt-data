The `break` statement does not modify any variables but instead causes the exit from the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block that is being exited here, the only impact is that the execution flow will exit the current context. However, since no loop or conditional block is mentioned, we assume the `break` statement is outside of any such structure and thus no change occurs to the variables.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`dep[end]` is the shortest distance from `center` to `end`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is not defined, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`, `bad` is `True**
