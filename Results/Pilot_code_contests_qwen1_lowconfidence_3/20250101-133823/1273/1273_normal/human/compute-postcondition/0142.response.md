To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop continues and how the given variables change.

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
2. **Variables Involved**:
   - `i`: Incremented by 1 at each iteration.
   - `deg[dep[1]]`: This value is checked and possibly modified.
   - `bad`: This variable is set based on the condition involving `deg[dep[1]]`.

### Given Information:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- If `deg[dep[1]]` was -1 and now equals `L`, then no change occurs.
- If `deg[dep[1]]` is not -1, then `bad` is True if `deg[dep[1]]` is not equal to the length of `e[1]`. Otherwise, no specific change is made to `bad`.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `i` starts at 1, it will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.
- The value of `i` changes, but the value of `deg[dep[1]]` and `bad` remain unchanged unless specified otherwise within the loop body.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop condition only depends on `i` being less than `n + 1`, and no specific change is mentioned for `deg[dep[1]]` or `bad` except when `i` reaches a certain value, the values of `deg[dep[1]]` and `bad` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final State:
- `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
- `deg[dep[1]]` remains unchanged.
- `bad` remains unchanged.

**State: **`i` is 2, `deg[dep[1]]` remains unchanged, `bad` remains unchanged**.
