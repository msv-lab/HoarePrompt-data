Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[center]` is the maximum depth found during the traversal and all other elements are `-1`. `i` is `n`. `cur` is the farthest node from `center` that has been processed. `q` is an empty deque, as the loop exits when there are no more nodes to process. `top` is the node that was most recently updated and set as the new top node during the loop execution. `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the degree (number of edges) of the corresponding node in the graph represented by `e`.**
