The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. This operation changes the state of the variable `q` by adding an additional element to it. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`cur` is the next element in `q`, `q` is updated to include the first element removed and `to` added to the end, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, and `dep[to]` is already updated if it was `-1`; `q` now contains the elements of the original `q` with `to` appended.**
