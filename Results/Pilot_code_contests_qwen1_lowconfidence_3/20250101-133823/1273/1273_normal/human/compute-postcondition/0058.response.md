According to the code, the loop iterates over each neighbor (`to`) of the current node (`cur`). At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:

- `cur` is the next node in `q`.
- `q` is updated by appending `to` to it.
- `i` is 0.
- `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph.
- `n` is the original input value.
- `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node (with `dep[to]` now equal to `dep[cur] + 1`).
- `to` is the last node added to the deque `q`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the states based on the loop's iteration logic:

1. **Determine the next `to`:** Since `to` is the last node added to the deque `q` in the previous iteration, the next iteration will pick the next node in `q` as `cur`.
2. **Update `cur`:** The next `cur` will be the next node in `q`.
3. **Update `q`:** `q` is updated by appending `to` to it. Since `to` is already the last node in `q`, no new nodes are added for the next iteration.
4. **Adjust `i`:** `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, so if it was 0 before the previous iteration, it will be 1 now.
5. **Dependent states:** `e`, `n`, and `dep` remain unchanged because they do not depend on the loop's iteration.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `cur` is the next node in `q`.
- `q` is updated by appending `to` to it (but remains the same as the last state since `to` is the last node).
- `i` is 1.
- `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph.
- `n` is the original input value.
- `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node (with `dep[to]` now equal to `dep[cur] + 1`).

State: **`cur` is the next node in `q`, `q` is updated by appending `to` to it, `i` is 1, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node (with `dep[to]` now equal to `dep[cur] + 1`)**
