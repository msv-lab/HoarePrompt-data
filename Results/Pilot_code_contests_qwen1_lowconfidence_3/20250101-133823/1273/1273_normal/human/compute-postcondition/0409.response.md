The code updates the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1`. According to the initial state, `dep[cur]` is `v`, and `dep[to]` is `v + 1`. Since `dep[cur]` is `v`, the new value of `dep[to]` will be `v + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a non-empty list with its first element removed, `cur` is the first element of the original `q`, `e[cur]` must have at least two elements, `dep[cur]` is `v`, `dep[to]` is `v + 1`, and `dep[to]` is updated to `v + 1`.**
