Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists
   - `n` is the original input value
   - `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) initialized to `-1` except for `dep[1]` which is `0`
   - `q` is an empty deque
   - `cur` is `1`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `to` in `e[cur]`.
   - This means `e[cur]` should contain at least one element (i.e., `e[cur]` should not be an empty list).

3. **Required Adjustments:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `e[cur]` must have at least one element. Since `cur` is `1`, we need to ensure `e[1]` is not empty.
   - No other adjustments are necessary based on the given information.

### Final State After Adjustments:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists
- `n` is the original input value
- `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) initialized to `-1` except for `dep[1]` which is `0`
- `q` is an empty deque
- `cur` is `1`
- `e[1]` must not be an empty list

### Answer:
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) initialized to `-1` except for `dep[1]` which is `0`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is `1`, `e[1]` must not be an empty list**
