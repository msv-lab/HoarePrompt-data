The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately without executing any further code. This means that no changes are made to any of the variables.

Output State: **`dep[end]` is the shortest distance from `center` to `end`, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is not defined, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`, and the value of `end` is printed.**
