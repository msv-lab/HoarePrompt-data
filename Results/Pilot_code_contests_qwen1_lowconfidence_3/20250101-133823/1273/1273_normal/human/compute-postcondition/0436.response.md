Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `q` is empty.
   - `cur` is the last node processed.
   - `dep` is a dictionary mapping nodes to their depth levels from the initial node in `q`.
   - `deg` is a list of length `n+1` with all elements initialized to -1.
   - `bad` is False.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`.

3. **What the Loop Requires:**
   - For the loop to execute, the variable `i` must start from 1 and go up to `n`.
   - Since the loop runs based on the value of `i`, we need to ensure that `i` is within the specified range.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - The initial values of `q`, `cur`, `dep`, `deg`, and `bad` do not directly impact the loop execution. The loop only cares about the range of `i`.
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start and continue until `i` reaches `n`.

5. **Final State After Adjustments:**
   - `i` should start from 1 and go up to `n`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is some positive integer**
