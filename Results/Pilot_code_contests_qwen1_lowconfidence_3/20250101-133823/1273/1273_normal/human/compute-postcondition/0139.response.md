The code `break` is used to exit a loop or the most inner enclosing structure. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional structure that `break` is explicitly part of, it does not affect the variables `i`, `deg[dep[i]]`, `bad`, or any other variables. The states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to -1, and the current value of `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to the length of `e[i]`, `bad` is True**
