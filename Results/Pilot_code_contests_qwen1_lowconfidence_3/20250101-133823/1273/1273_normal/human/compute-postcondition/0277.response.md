The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. No other variables are affected. 

Given the initial state:
- `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with a `0` at index `center` and all other elements are `-1`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `cur` is the next `to` from `e[cur]`.
- `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`.

After executing the code `q.append(to)`, the list `q` now includes the value of `to`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with a `0` at index `center` and all other elements are `-1`, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the next `to` from `e[cur]`, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, and `q` is a list with `to` appended to it.**
