The code updates the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1`. Given the initial state, `dep[cur]` is `0` because `dep[to]` was previously `-1` and is now set to `0` based on the code execution. Since `cur` must have at least one neighbor in `e[cur]`, and `to` is one of those neighbors, `dep[cur]` is `0`. Thus, `dep[to]` becomes `0 + 1`, which is `1`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[center]` is `0` and all other elements are `-1`; `i` is `n`; `cur` is the value of the leftmost element of `q` before the operation; `q` loses its leftmost element; `top` is the node that was most recently updated and set as the new top node during the loop execution; `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the degree (number of edges) of the corresponding node in the graph represented by `e`; `cur` must have at least one neighbor in `e[cur]`; `dep[to]` is `1`.**
