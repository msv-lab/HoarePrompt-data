Output State: **`i` is `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `True` if there exists any `j` (where `1 ≤ j ≤ n`) such that `deg[dep[j]]` is not equal to `len(e[j])`, otherwise `bad` is `False`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `1` to `n`. For each iteration, it checks if `deg[dep[i]]` is `-1`. If it is, it sets `deg[dep[i]]` to `len(e[i])`.
- If `deg[dep[i]]` is not `-1`, it checks if `deg[dep[i]]` is equal to `len(e[i])`. If they are not equal, it sets `bad` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
- Since the loop breaks if it finds any mismatch between `deg[dep[i]]` and `len(e[i])`, the loop will either continue until it finishes all iterations (if no mismatches are found) or break early if a mismatch is found.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `n+1` because the loop increments `i` from `1` to `n` and then exits.
- `bad` will be `True` if there was at least one index `j` where `deg[dep[j]]` did not match `len(e[j])`. Otherwise, `bad` will remain `False`.
