The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. Given the initial state where `q` is a non-empty list with the first element being `cur` and the second element being `to`, the length of `q` is 2. After appending `to` to `q`, the list `q` will have three elements: the first element remains `cur`, the second element remains `to`, and the third element is `to`.

Output State: **`q` is a list with elements `[cur, to, to]`, `cur` is the first element of `q`, `e[cur]` is a non-empty iterable with at least one element, `dep[cur]` remains a non-negative integer, `dep[to]` is now `dep[cur] + 1`.**
