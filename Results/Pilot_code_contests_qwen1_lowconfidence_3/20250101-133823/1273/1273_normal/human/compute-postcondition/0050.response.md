Output State: **`cur` is the node that is currently being processed, `q` is the deque containing nodes that need to be processed, `i` is 0 (indicating that no more nodes need to be processed), `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, `to` is the last node added to the deque `q`, and every node in the graph that is reachable from node `1` has had its distance correctly set to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`cur`**: After all iterations, `cur` will be the last node processed in the BFS traversal.
- **`q`**: The deque will be empty since all nodes have been processed.
- **`i`**: Will be `0` because no more nodes need to be processed.
- **`e`**: Remains unchanged as the loop only updates distances and does not modify the adjacency list.
- **`n`**: The original input value remains unchanged.
- **`dep`**: Every node that is reachable from node `1` will have its distance correctly set. Specifically, for any node `to` where `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, it will now be set to `dep[cur] + 1`.
- **`to`**: The last node added to the deque `q` during the final iteration.

If the loop does not execute at all (which would happen if the graph is disconnected and no path exists from node `1` to other nodes), the values of the variables will be:
- **`cur`**: The first element of the deque, as it was never changed.
- **`q`**: The deque containing only the first element (since it was never modified).
- **`i`**: The value of `n - 1` (since the loop did not reduce it).
- **`dep`**: A list where some elements might still be `-1` indicating those nodes are unreachable from node `1`.

However, based on the problem statement and the typical behavior of such a BFS algorithm, we assume that the graph is connected and the loop will eventually process all reachable nodes. Thus, the final state is as described above.
