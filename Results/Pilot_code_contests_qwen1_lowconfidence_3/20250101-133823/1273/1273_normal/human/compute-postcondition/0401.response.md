To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given conditions and the while loop.

### Given Conditions:
- `q` is a non-empty list or iterable.
- `cur` is the first element of `q` before the operation.
- `e[cur]` is an iterable containing elements whose `dep` value was initially -1.
- For each `to` in `e[cur]` where `dep[to]` was initially -1, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.

### While Loop Condition:
```
while q:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop continues as long as `q` is non-empty. To proceed to the next iteration of the loop, `q` must still contain at least one element. 

From the given conditions, we know:
- `q` starts non-empty, but it may become empty after processing elements.
- The loop updates the `dep` values of certain elements when `q` is non-empty.

### Determining the Next Iteration State:
For the loop to continue executing, `q` must still contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `q` remains non-empty.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is to ensure that `q` is non-empty.

### Final Answer:
State: **`q` is a non-empty list or iterable**
