Postcondition: ***`cur` is the next node in `q`, `q` is updated by removing the leftmost element, `i` is 0, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, `to` is the last node added to the deque `q`, and `dep[to]` is equal to -1***

This postcondition retains all the information from the precondition and includes the additional condition from the if statement, indicating that `dep[to]` is equal to -1.
