The code sets the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1`. Given the initial state where `dep[to]` is -1, this means `dep[to]` will now be `dep[cur] + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is the leftmost element of `q`, `q` is not empty, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, the current value of `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, and the length of `e[to]` is 2**
