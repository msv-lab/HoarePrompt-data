Postcondition: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with a `0` at index `center` and all other elements are `-1`, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the next `to` from `e[cur]`, `dep[to]` is either `dep[cur] + 1` or unchanged (if `len(e[to]) == 1`), `top` is the value of `to` if `len(e[to]) == 1` and `q` is either a list with `to` appended to it or an empty list.**
