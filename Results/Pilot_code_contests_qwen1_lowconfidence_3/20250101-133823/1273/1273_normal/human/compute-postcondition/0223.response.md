The code `deg[dep[i]] = len(e[i])` updates the value of `deg[dep[i]]` to `len(e[i])`. From the initial state, we know that `deg[dep[i]]` was initially `-1`. Therefore, after executing this line of code, `deg[dep[i]]` will be updated to `len(e[i])`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged: `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from `center` to `end`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is not defined, and `bad` is `False`.

Output State: **`dep[end]` is the shortest distance from `center` to `end`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is not defined, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1` except `deg[dep[i]]` which is now `len(e[i])`, `bad` is `False`.**
