The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be the value of `dep[cur]` plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `cur` is the leftmost element of the original `q`
- `q` is the original `q` with the previously appended `to` and the new `to` appended
- `e[cur]` must contain at least one element
- `dep[new_to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`

The Output State is: **`cur` is the leftmost element of the original `q`, `q` is the original `q` with the previously appended `to` and the new `to` appended, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[new_to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`.**
