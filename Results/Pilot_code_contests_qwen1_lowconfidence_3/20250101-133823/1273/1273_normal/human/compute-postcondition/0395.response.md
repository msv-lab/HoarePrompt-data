Postcondition: ***`q` is a non-empty list with the first element being `cur` and the second element being `to`, `cur` is the first element of `q`, `e[cur]` is a non-empty iterable, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`, and `dep[cur]` remains a non-negative integer. Since there is no else part, the postcondition only includes the if part's condition.***
