`e[v]` is a sublist within the list `e`. According to the initial state, `e[v]` contains `[v, v]`. The code appends `u` to `e[v]`. Therefore, `e[v]` will now contain `[v, v, u]`.

The values of the other variables (`i` and `e`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) empty sublists, except for the sublist at index `u` which now contains `[v, v, u]`**
