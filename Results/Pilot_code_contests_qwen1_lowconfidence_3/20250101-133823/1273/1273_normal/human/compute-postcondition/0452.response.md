The code `deg[dep[i]] = len(e[i])` impacts the program by updating the value of `deg[dep[i]]` with the length of `e[i]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, and `bad` retains its current value, we need to determine the updated value of `deg[dep[i]]`.

Since `i` is 3, the code translates to `deg[dep[3]] = len(e[3])`. However, the values of `dep[3]` and `e[3]` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only express the updated value of `deg[dep[3]]` in terms of `len(e[3])`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` retains its current value, `deg[dep[3]]` is `len(e[3])`**
