Postcondition: ***`cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` now contains its first element plus the next element from `e[cur]`, `e[cur]` must have at least one element remaining, and `dep[to]` is either `dep[cur] + 1` or remains `-1` if it hasn't been initialized. If `dep[to]` equals `-1`, it is set to `dep[cur] + 1`.***
