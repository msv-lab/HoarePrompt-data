The code updates the value of `dep[to]` to be `dep[cur] + 1`. This means that the distance from node `1` to node `to` is one more than the distance from node `1` to node `cur`. The other variables are not affected.

- `cur` remains the next node in `q`.
- `q` still contains at least one element (a neighbor of `cur`).
- `i` remains `2`.
- `e` is still a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph.
- `n` remains the original input value.
- `dep` is still a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, with the exception that `dep[to]` is now updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`cur` is the next node in `q`, `q` contains at least one element (a neighbor of `cur`), `i` is 2, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, and `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.**
