The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the deque `q`. The variable `q` is initially an empty deque, and the value of `to` is part of the sublist `e[1]` since `e[1]` is not empty. After appending, `q` will contain the value of `to`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) initialized to `-1` except for `dep[1]` which is `0` and `dep[to]` is `1`, `q` is a deque containing `to`, `cur` is `1`**
