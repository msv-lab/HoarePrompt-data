`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. Given the initial state, `dep[cur]` is the distance from node `1` to node `cur`, and `dep[to]` was previously equal to -1 (since `to` was the last node added to the deque `q` and its distance was not yet computed).

After executing the line `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1`, the value of `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`cur` is the next node in `q`, `q` is updated by removing the leftmost element, `i` is 0, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node (with `dep[to]` now equal to `dep[cur] + 1`), `to` is the last node added to the deque `q`, and `dep[cur]` remains unchanged.**
