`q` is appended with the value `to`. The value of `to` is `-1` based on the initial state. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with a `0` at index `center`, `0` at index `to`, and all other elements are `-1`, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the next `to` from `e[cur]`, `q` is a list containing `-1`, `top` is updated based on the loop body.
