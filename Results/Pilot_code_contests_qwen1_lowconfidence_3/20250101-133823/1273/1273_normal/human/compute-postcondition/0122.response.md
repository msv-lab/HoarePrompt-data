`q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. This changes the value of `q` by adding `to` to its current contents. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a dictionary, `pred[to]` is equal to `end`, `q` contains `to` (appended), `e[end]` must contain at least two elements; `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[end] + 1`, `pred[to]` is now equal to `end`, `q` is updated to include `to`**
