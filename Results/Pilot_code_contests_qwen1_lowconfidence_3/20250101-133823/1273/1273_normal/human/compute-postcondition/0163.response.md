`center` is reassigned to the value at index `center` in the list `pred`. Since the initial state of `center` is the value at index `center` in the list `pred`, this assignment doesn't change its value. Therefore, the value of `center` remains the same as before the execution of the code. The values of `i` and `dep[end]` remain unchanged as well.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `dep[end]` must be greater than 1, `center` is the value at index `center` in the list `pred`**
