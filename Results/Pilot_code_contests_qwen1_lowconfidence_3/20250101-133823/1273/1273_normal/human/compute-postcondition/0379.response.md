The code snippet `print(center)` does not affect any variables. It simply prints the value of the variable `center`. Since the initial state does not provide any information about the value of `center`, the value of `center` remains unchanged after executing this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is `n+1`, `deg[dep[i-1]]` is the length of `e[i-1]` for all `i` from `1` to `n` or not equal to `-1`, `bad` remains `False` if any `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to the length of `e[i]` for any `i` from `1` to `n`, and `center` retains its original value.**
