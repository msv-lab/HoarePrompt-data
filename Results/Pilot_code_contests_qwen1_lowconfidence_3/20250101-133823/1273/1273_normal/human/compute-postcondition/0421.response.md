The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be one more than the current value of `dep[cur]`. The value of `dep[cur]` was previously known to be a non-negative integer since it represents a depth in a tree or graph traversal. After executing this line of code, `dep[to]` will be updated to reflect its new depth, which is exactly one more than the depth of `cur`.

The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes:

- `cur` is the element that was at the front of `q` before `popleft()` was called.
- `q` is the original queue with the first element removed.
- `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, meaning there is at least one adjacent node to `cur`.
- The node `to` has not been visited, i.e., `dep[to]` is still equal to -1.
- `dep[to]` is now updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`cur` is the element that was at the front of `q` before `popleft()` was called, `q` is the original queue with the first element removed, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is now `dep[cur] + 1`**
