The code `q.append(to)` appends the variable `to` to the queue `q`. This operation affects the queue `q` by adding the new element `to` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`end` is the value that was at the front of the queue `q` before calling `popleft`, `dep[end]` must contain at least one element; `dep[to]` is now `dep[end] + 1`; `pred[to]` is `end`; the node `to` is currently not visited, indicated by `dep[to]` being -1; `q` now contains all its previous elements plus `to`.**
