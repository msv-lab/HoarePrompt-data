The code `e[u].append(v)` appends the value `v` to the sublist at index `u` in the list `e`. Initially, the sublist at index `u` contains `[v, v, u]`. After appending `v` to this sublist, the sublist at index `u` will contain `[v, v, u, v]`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated states are:
- `i` is 2 (unchanged)
- `e` is a list of `n + 1` empty sublists, except for the sublist at index `u` which now contains `[v, v, u, v]` (the original sublist plus the new `v` appended)
- `n` must be greater than 3 (unchanged)
- `u` is an integer input (unchanged)
- `v` is an integer input (unchanged)

Output State: **`i` is 2, `e` is a list of `n + 1` empty sublists, except for the sublist at index `u` which now contains `[v, v, u, v]`, `n` must be greater than 3, `u` is an integer input, `v` is an integer input**
