The code initializes a list `dep` with `-1` for each index from `0` to `n`. The length of this list is `n + 1`. The values of `i` and `e` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists where each sublist at index `u` contains all `v` such that there is a bidirectional edge between `u` and `v`, `n` is the original input value, and `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to `-1`.**
