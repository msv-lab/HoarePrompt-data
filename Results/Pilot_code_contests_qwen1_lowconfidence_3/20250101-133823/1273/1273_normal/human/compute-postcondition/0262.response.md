The code `break` is executed, which does not change the values of any variables but indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The states of all the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with a `0` at index `center` and all other elements are `-1`, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is `center`, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`, `top` is now `to`, `e[center]` contains at least one element, and the current value of `dep[to]` is not `-1` and the length of `e[to]` is exactly `1`.**
