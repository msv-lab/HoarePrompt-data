`q` is a queue, and the code appends the variable `to` to the end of the queue. The value of `cur` remains the same, and the updated queue `q` now contains its original elements plus the new element `to`. The condition `e[cur]` must contain at least one element and `dep[to]` is now `dep[cur] + 1` remain true.

Output State: **`cur` is the element that was at the front of `q` before `popleft()` was called, `q` is the original queue with the first element removed and `to` added to the end, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is now `dep[cur] + 1`**
