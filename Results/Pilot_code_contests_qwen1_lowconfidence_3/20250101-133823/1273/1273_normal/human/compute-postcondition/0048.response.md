The code `q.append(to)` appends the variable `to` to the deque `q`. This operation changes the state of the deque `q` but does not affect the values of `cur`, `i`, `dep[to]`, or `dep[cur]`. The value of `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`, and the value of `dep[cur]` is `value + 1` where `value` is the original value that `dep[cur]` was updated to from `-1`.

Output State: **`cur` is the new element that was added to the deque `q` after removing the previous `cur`, `i` is `n - 2`, `to` is the new `cur` for the next iteration, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, `dep[cur]` is `value + 1` where `value` is the original value that `dep[cur]` was updated to from `-1`, `q` is updated to include the element `to` at the end.**
