Postcondition: ***`end` is the value that was at the front of the queue `q` before calling `popleft`, and `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[end] + 1`, `pred[to]` is set to `end`, `q` now contains all its previous elements plus `to`, and `e[end]` must contain at least one element. This is true regardless of whether `dep[to]` was -1 or not, as the if condition only updates the state when `dep[to]` is -1, and the else part does not alter the preconditions.***
