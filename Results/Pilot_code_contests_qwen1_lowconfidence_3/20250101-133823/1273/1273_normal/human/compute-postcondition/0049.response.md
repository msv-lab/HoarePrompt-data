Postcondition: **`cur` is the new element that was added to the deque `q` after removing the previous `cur`, `i` is `n - 2`, `to` is the new `cur` for the next iteration. If `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, then `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` and `q` is updated to include the element `to` at the end.**
