Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `dep[end]` is 0, `i` is 0, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is a deque containing `to_new`, `to`, `to`, or `to_new`, `to`, `cur` is the next neighbor of `end`, and `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1 if the condition `dep[to] == -1` is true, otherwise, the values remain unchanged as per the initial state.***
