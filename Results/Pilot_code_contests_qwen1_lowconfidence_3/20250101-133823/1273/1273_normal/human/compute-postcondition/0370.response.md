Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `deg[dep[1]]` remains unchanged, and `bad` is True unless `deg[dep[1]]` is not equal to the length of `e[2]`, in which case `bad` becomes False. Additionally, `deg[dep[1]]` remains the same as it was not modified inside the loop body and `bad` remains the same unless the loop body changes its value.***
