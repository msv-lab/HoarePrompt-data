The code snippet `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. This means that `q` now contains one additional element, which is `to`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

- `dep` remains the same: `dep[center]` is `0`, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, and all other elements are `-1`.
- `i` remains either `n` or `n - 1`.
- `cur` remains either the value of the second leftmost element of `q` or the leftmost element of `q` before the operation.
- `q` now has one more element, which is `to`.
- `top` remains either the node that was most recently updated and set as the new top node during the loop execution or `to`.
- `deg` remains the same: a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the degree (number of edges) of the corresponding node in the graph represented by `e`.
- `cur` must still have at least one neighbor in `e[cur]`.

Output State: **`dep[center]` is 0, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, and all other elements are -1; `i` is either `n` or `n - 1`; `cur` is either the value of the second leftmost element of `q` or the leftmost element of `q` before the operation; `q` has one more element, which is `to`; `top` is either the node that was most recently updated and set as the new top node during the loop execution or `to`; `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the degree (number of edges) of the corresponding node in the graph represented by `e`; `cur` must have at least one neighbor in `e[cur]`.**
