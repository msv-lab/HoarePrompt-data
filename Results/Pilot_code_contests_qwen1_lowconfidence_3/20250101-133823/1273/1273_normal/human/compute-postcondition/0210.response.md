`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. This means that the depth of `to` is one more than the depth of `cur`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`cur` is the leftmost element of the original `q`, `q` is the original `q` with some `to` appended, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`.**
