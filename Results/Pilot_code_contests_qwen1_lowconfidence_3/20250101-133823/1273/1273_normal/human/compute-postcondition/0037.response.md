Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States
- `cur` is the first element in the deque `q` after it has been removed.
- `q` is the deque with its first element removed.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists.
- `n` is the original input value.
- `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node.
- `to` is the last node added to the deque `q`.

### For Loop
The loop iterates over the neighbors of `cur` as given by the sublist `e[cur]`.

### Conditions for Loop Execution
1. **List `e[cur]`:** The loop body will execute for each element in `e[cur]`. Therefore, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.
2. **Variable `to`:** In each iteration, `to` takes the value of an element from `e[cur]`. After the loop, `to` will be the last node added to the deque `q`.

### Adjusting the States
To ensure the loop can execute:
- We need to ensure `e[cur]` contains at least one element.
- We need to adjust the state of `to` to reflect the last node added to the deque `q` after the loop.

### Final State
- `cur` is the first element in the deque `q` after it has been removed.
- `q` is the deque with its first element removed.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists.
- `n` is the original input value.
- `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node.
- `to` is the last node added to the deque `q` (which means `to` is the current neighbor being processed).

### Final Answer
State: **`cur` is the first element in the deque `q` after it has been removed, `q` is the deque with its first element removed, `i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, `to` is the last node added to the deque `q` and `e[cur]` must contain at least one element**.
