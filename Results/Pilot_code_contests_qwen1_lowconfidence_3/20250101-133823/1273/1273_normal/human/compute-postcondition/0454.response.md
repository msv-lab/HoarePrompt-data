The code `break` does not assign any new values to variables but breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no such loop or switch in the provided code, it simply exits the current context. The values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `bad` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is True**
