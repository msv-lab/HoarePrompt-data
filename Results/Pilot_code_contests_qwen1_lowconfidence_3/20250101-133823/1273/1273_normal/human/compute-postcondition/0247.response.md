`top` is assigned the value of `center`. The value of `center` is such that `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`dep[end]` is the shortest distance from `center` to `end`, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is not defined, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`, and `top` is `center`.**
