According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `to` and the structure of the list `e[cur]`. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is the leftmost element of the original `q`, `q` is the original `q` with `to` appended, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, then `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`.

To determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. **The current value of `cur`:** The value of `cur` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
2. **The updated state of `q`:** The queue `q` now includes the `to` value appended to it.
3. **The condition for the loop to continue:** The loop will continue as long as `e[cur]` contains at least one element.

Given that `e[cur]` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute again, let's assume that `e[cur]` still contains elements (since if it did not, the loop would have terminated).

At the start of the next iteration, the state will be:

- `cur` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `q` now includes the `to` value appended to it.
- `e[cur]` still contains at least one element, meaning there is at least one valid `to` to process.

Since the specific value of `to` used in the previous iteration does not affect the general condition for the loop to continue, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`cur` is the leftmost element of the original `q`, `q` is the original `q` with some `to` appended, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.**

However, to provide a more concrete state for the next iteration, we can specify the next `to` value, but since we don't know the exact value, we keep it in a general form.

State: **`cur` is the leftmost element of the original `q`, `q` is the original `q` with some `to` appended, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and if `dep[next_to]` was initially `-1`, then `dep[next_to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`.**

Where `next_to` is the next value that will be processed in the loop.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`cur` is the leftmost element of the original `q`, `q` is the original `q` with some `to` appended, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and if `dep[next_to]` was initially `-1`, then `dep[next_to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`.**
