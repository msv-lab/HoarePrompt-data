Output State: **`cur` is the next node in `q`, `q` is a deque containing all nodes reachable from node `1` in the order of their distances from node `1`, `i` is the number of times the loop has executed, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, and if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, then `dep[to]` is now set to `dep[cur] + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to update the `dep` list by setting the distance of unvisited neighbors of the current node `cur` to `dep[cur] + 1`.
- `cur` is updated to the next node in `q` after processing all its neighbors.
- `q` starts as the deque with the initial node (usually node `1`) and gets updated by appending all unvisited neighbors of `cur` whose distances were initially `-1`.
- The loop continues until all nodes reachable from node `1` have their distances correctly set.
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., `q` is empty initially or no further nodes can be visited), `cur` will be the next node in `q`, `q` will be empty, and `i` will be the number of iterations that did not update `q` (i.e., the loop did not find any new nodes to visit).

Thus, after all iterations, `q` will contain all nodes reachable from node `1` in the order of their distances from node `1`, `dep` will contain the correct distances for all reachable nodes, and `cur` and `i` will reflect the final state of the loop.
