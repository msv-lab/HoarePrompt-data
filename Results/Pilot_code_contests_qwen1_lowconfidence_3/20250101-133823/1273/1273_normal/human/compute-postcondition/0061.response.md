Postcondition: ***`cur` is the next node in `q`, `q` is updated by appending `to` to it, `i` is 1, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, and if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, then `dep[to]` is now set to `dep[cur] + 1`.***
