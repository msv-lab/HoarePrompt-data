The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the deque `q`. The value of `to` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but since `to` is undefined, it suggests that `to` could be any value. However, for the sake of clarity and adhering to the instructions, we will keep it as `to`.

The initial state includes `q` being a non-empty deque, but appending `to` (which is undefined) to `q` does not affect the fact that `q` is non-empty. It simply adds another element to the deque.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `q` is a non-empty deque containing at least one element (the original element plus `to`), `cur` is 0, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is -1 except for `dep[cur]` which is 0, `to` is undefined, `pred` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is 0 and `pred[to]` is set to `end`, `end` points to a node with neighbors, and `dep[end]` remains -1.**
