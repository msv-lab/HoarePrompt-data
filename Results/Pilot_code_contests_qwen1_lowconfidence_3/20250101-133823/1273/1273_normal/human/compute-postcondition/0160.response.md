Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Program State:
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `bad` remains `False`
- `deg[dep[i]]` is updated for each `i` from 1 to `n` if necessary
- `cur` is printed with its current value
- `end` remains the last node added to `q`
- `dep` remains a list of length \(n + 1\) representing the shortest distances
- `pred` remains a list of length \(n + 1\) representing the predecessors
- `cur` remains the last node processed
- `e` remains a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph
- `deg` remains a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is updated if necessary
- `bad` remains `False`
- `center` is equal to the last node added to `q`

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(dep[end] // 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `i`:**
   - The loop will start with `i = 0` since `range(dep[end] // 2)` will generate values from `0` to `dep[end] // 2 - 1`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < dep[end] // 2`.

3. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - **`i`**: It should be set to `0` initially.
   - **`dep[end]`**: This value determines the upper bound of the loop. The loop will execute as long as `dep[end] // 2 > 0`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - Since `cur`, `end`, `dep`, `pred`, `e`, `deg`, `bad`, and `center` are described as remaining unchanged or as they were after some previous operations, these do not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

### Final State Adjustment:
- `i` must be `0` (since the loop starts at `0`).
- `dep[end]` must be greater than `1` (since `dep[end] // 2` must be greater than `0`).

### Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `dep[end]` must be greater than 1**
