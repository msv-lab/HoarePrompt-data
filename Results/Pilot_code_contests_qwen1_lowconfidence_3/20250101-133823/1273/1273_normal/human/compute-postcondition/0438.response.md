`i` is set to 1 in the initial state, `n` is a positive integer, and `deg[dep[1]]` equals -1. The code updates `deg[dep[i]]` to be the length of `e[i]`. Since `i` is 1, this translates to updating `deg[dep[1]]` to be the length of `e[1]`.

The initial state shows that `deg[dep[1]]` is -1. After executing the code, `deg[dep[1]]` will be updated to `len(e[1])`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `deg[dep[1]]` is `len(e[1])`**
