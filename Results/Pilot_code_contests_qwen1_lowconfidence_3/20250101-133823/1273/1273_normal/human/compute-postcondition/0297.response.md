Postcondition: ***`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[center]` is `0` and all other elements are `-1`; `i` is `n - 1`; `cur` is the value of the leftmost element of `q` before the operation; `q` is an empty list; `top` is `to`; `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the degree (number of edges) of the corresponding node in the graph represented by `e`; `cur` must have at least one neighbor in `e[cur]`; `dep[to]` remains `0`.***

Explanation:
- The if part sets `i` to `n - 1`, `q` to an empty list, and updates `top` to `to`.
- Since there is no else part, if the condition `len(e[to]) == 1` is false, the state remains unchanged according to the precondition, specifically, `dep[to]` remains `0`.
