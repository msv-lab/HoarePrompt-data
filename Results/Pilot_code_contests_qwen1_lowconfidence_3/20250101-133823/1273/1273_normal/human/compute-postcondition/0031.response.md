The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is `n - 1`
- `cur` is the first unvisited neighbor of node `1` in the list `e[1]`
- `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists
- `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) initialized to `-1` except for `dep[1]` which is `0` and `dep[cur]` which is `1`
- `q` is a deque containing `cur` and `2`
- `to` is now the second neighbor of `cur` in the list `e[cur]`

After executing the line `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1`, `dep[to]` will be updated to `1 + 1 = 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `cur` is the first unvisited neighbor of node `1` in the list `e[1]`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) initialized to `-1` except for `dep[1]` which is `0`, `dep[cur]` which is `1`, and `dep[to]` which is `2`, `q` is a deque containing `cur` and `2`, `to` is now the second neighbor of `cur` in the list `e[cur]`.**
