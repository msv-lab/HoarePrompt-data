The code `dep[cur] = 0` assigns the value 0 to the element in the list `dep` at the index given by the variable `cur`. Since `cur` is the last node processed, its value is the same as before, and `dep` is updated to have its current value at `cur` set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` is an empty list, `cur` is the last node processed, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is -1 except for `dep[cur]` which is 0, `to` is the last node that was added to the deque `q` if it exists, and `pred` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is 0.**
