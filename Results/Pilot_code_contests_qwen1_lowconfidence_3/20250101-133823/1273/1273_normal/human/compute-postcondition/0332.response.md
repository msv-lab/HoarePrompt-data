Postcondition: ***`cur` is the leftmost element of `q`, `q` is not empty, `e[cur]` contains at least one element, and the current value of `dep[to]` is `-1`. If `len(e[to]) == 2`, then `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`. Otherwise, `dep[to]` remains `-1`. Additionally, if `len(e[to]) == 1`, then `top` is equal to `to` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
