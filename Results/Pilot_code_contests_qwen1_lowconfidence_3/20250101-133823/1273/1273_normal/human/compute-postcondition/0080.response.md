Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is 0, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is -1 except for `dep[cur]` which is 0, `to` is undefined, `pred` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is 0 and `pred[to]` is 0, `end` is 0, and `dep[to]` remains -1 (since `to` is undefined).***
