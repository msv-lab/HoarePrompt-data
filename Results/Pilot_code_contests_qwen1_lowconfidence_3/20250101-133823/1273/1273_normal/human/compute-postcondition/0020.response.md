`cur` is assigned the value of `q.popleft()`. The deque `q` initially contains `[1]`, so `cur` will take the value `1` and `q` will be empty after this operation. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) initialized to `-1` except for `dep[1]` which is `0`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is `1`.**
