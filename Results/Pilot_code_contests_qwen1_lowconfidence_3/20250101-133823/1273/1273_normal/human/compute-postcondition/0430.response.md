`q` appends the value of `to`. The value of `cur` remains the next element in `q`, `e[cur]` still contains at least one element, and `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cur` is the next element in `q`, `q` now contains `to` as the last element, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`**
