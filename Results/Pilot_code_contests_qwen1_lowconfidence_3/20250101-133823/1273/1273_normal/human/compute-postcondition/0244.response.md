The code snippet `print(end)` simply prints the value of the variable `end`. This does not change the value of any variable. The only change is that the value of `end` is printed.

Given the initial state:
- `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from `center` to `end`
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is a positive integer
- `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`
- `q` is an empty deque
- `cur` is not defined
- `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`

After the code executes, the following is true:
- The value of `end` is printed.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep[end]` is the shortest distance from `center` to `end`, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is not defined, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`, and the value of `end` is printed.**
