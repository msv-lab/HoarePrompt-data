Postcondition: ***`dep[end]` is the shortest distance from `center` to `end`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is not defined, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`. If `deg[dep[i]] == -1`, then `deg[dep[i]]` is set to `len(e[i])` and `bad` remains `False`. Otherwise, `bad` is set to `True`.***
