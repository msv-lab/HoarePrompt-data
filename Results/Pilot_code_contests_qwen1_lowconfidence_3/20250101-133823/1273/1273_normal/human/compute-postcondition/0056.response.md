The code `q.append(to)` appends the variable `to` to the deque `q`. This means that the next node (`to`) will be processed in the future. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `cur` is still the next node in `q`, `i` is still 0, `e` is still a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is still the original input value, `dep` is still a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node (with `dep[to]` now equal to `dep[cur] + 1`), and `to` is still the last node added to the deque `q`.

Output State: **`cur` is the next node in `q`, `q` is updated by appending `to` to it, `i` is 0, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node (with `dep[to]` now equal to `dep[cur] + 1`), `to` is the last node added to the deque `q`.**
