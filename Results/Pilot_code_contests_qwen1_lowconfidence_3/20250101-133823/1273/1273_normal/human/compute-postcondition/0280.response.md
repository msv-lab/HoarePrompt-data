The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables but indicates the exit from the current loop or conditional statement. Since no loop or conditional statement is explicitly mentioned in the provided code, the execution of `break` implies exiting the context in which it was used, but the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with a `0` at index `center` and all other elements are `-1`, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the next `to` from `e[cur]`, `top` is the value of `to`, `q` is an empty list.**
