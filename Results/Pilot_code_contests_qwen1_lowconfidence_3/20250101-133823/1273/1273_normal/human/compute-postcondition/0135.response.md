The code `deg[dep[i]] = len(e[i])` updates the value of `deg[dep[i]]`. From the initial state, we know that `i` is 1 and `deg[dep[i]]` equals -1. Since `i` is 1, `dep[i]` refers to `dep[1]`. Therefore, the code updates `deg[dep[1]]` to be `len(e[1])`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 1; `deg[dep[1]]` is `len(e[1])`; `deg[dep[i]]` equals -1 before the update**.

However, since the update occurs, the final state should reflect the updated value. Assuming `e[1]` is known (but not specified in the problem), let's denote its length as `L`. Thus, the final state would be:

Output State: **`i` is 1; `deg[dep[1]]` is `L`; `deg[dep[i]]` was -1 before the update**.

If the exact length of `e[1]` is not specified, we can represent it as `L`:

Output State: **`i` is 1; `deg[dep[1]]` is `L`; `deg[dep[i]]` was -1 before the update**.
