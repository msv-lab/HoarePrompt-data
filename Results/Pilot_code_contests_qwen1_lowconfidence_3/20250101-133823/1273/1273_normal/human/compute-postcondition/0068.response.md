The code sets the list `dep` to a list of `-1` with a length of `n + 1`. This means every element in `dep` is initialized to `-1`.

- The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still `0`.
- The value of `q` remains unchanged and is still an empty list.
- The value of `cur` remains unchanged and is still the last node processed.
- The value of `e` remains unchanged and is still the adjacency list of the graph.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still the original input value.
- The value of `dep` changes to a list of length `n + 1` where each element is `-1`.
- There is no information about the last node added to the deque `q`, so `to` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` is an empty list, `cur` is the last node processed, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is -1, and `to` is the last node that was added to the deque `q` if it exists.**
