The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be one more than the current value of `dep[cur]`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `cur` is the first element of `q`
- `q` now contains its first element plus the next element from `e[cur]`
- `e[cur]` must have at least one element remaining
- `dep[to]` is now equal to `dep[cur] + 1`

Output State: **`cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` now contains its first element plus the next element from `e[cur]`, `e[cur]` must have at least one element remaining, and `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`**
