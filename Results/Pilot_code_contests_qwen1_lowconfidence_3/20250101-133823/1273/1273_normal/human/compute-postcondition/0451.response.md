Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is a positive integer
- If `deg[dep[2]]` is `-1`, no changes are made to `bad`.
- Otherwise, `bad` is set to `True` if `deg[dep[2]]` does not equal `len(e[2])`. If `deg[dep[2]]` equals `len(e[2])`, `bad` retains its original value.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over values of `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, meaning the loop has already executed for `i = 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i = 3`.

### Modified State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` will be 3.
- Since we don't have information about what happens inside the loop body, the values of `n`, `deg[dep[2]]`, and `len(e[2])` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

### Final State:
- `i` is 3
- `n` remains a positive integer
- `bad` retains its current value (since the loop hasn't executed yet for `i = 3`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` retains its current value**.
