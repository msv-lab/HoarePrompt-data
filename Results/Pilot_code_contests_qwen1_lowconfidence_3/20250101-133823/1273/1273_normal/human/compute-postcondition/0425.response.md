`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. This means that the distance (`dep`) to `to` is now one more than the distance to `cur`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`cur` is the next element in `q`, `q` is the updated queue with the first element removed and `to` added to the end, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, and `dep[to]` is already updated if it was `-1`.**
