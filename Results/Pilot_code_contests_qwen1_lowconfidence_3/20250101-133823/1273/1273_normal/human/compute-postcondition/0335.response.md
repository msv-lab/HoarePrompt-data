The given code snippet is:
```python
dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

1. `dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. This means that the dependency level (`dep`) for the node `to` is set to one more than the dependency level of the node `cur`.

2. The variables `cur` and `q` must still be valid for the loop to continue. Since the code snippet does not modify `q` or `cur`, these variables retain their previous states.

3. The precondition that `e[cur]` must contain at least one element and `to` must be the first element in `e[cur]` is still valid.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`.
- `cur` remains the next leftmost element of `q` after processing the current `to`.
- `q` must still be non-empty.
- `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `to` is the first element in `e[cur]`.

Output State: **`dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`; `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` after processing the current `to`; `q` is non-empty; `e[cur]` contains at least one element and the first element is `to`.**
