Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while q:`. This means the loop continues as long as `q` (the deque) is not empty.

2. **Current State**:
   - `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from `center` to `end`.
   - `i` is the number of iterations the loop has executed.
   - `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`.
   - `q` is a deque containing nodes that need to be processed.
   - `cur` is the current node being processed.
   - For each node `to` in `e[cur]`, if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, it is now updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to continue, `q` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `q` is not empty at the start of the next iteration.

### Required Adjustments

- **`q` should not be empty**: Since the loop runs while `q` is non-empty, we need to ensure that `q` remains non-empty for the next iteration.

Given that `q` is a deque containing nodes that need to be processed, we don't need to make any specific adjustments to other variables (`dep[end]`, `i`, `center`, etc.) because the loop will continue as long as there are elements in `q`.

### Final State

The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `q` is not empty. Therefore, the state for the next iteration should reflect that `q` must not be empty.

**State:**
**`dep[end]` is the shortest distance from `center` to `end`, `i` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` must not be empty, `cur` is the current node being processed, and for each node `to` in `e[cur]`, if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, it is now updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.**
