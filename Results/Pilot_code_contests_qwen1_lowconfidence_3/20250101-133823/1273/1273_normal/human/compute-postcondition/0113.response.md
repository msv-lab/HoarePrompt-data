To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the structure of the for loop.

### Given Information:
- `end`: The value of the element that was removed from the front of `q`.
- `dep`: A dictionary where each key represents a node and the value is the shortest distance from the starting node.
- `pred`: A dictionary where each key represents a node and the value is its predecessor in the shortest path.
- `q`: A queue (or similar data structure) that does not contain the element that had been `end`.

### For Loop:
```
for to in e[end]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `to`:**
   - The loop iterates over the elements in `e[end]`.
   - `e` is assumed to be a dictionary or a similar data structure where `e[key]` returns a collection of values.
   - For the loop to iterate over `e[end]`, `e[end]` must not be an empty collection (i.e., it must contain at least one element).

2. **Variable `e`:**
   - `e` is a data structure that maps keys to collections of values.
   - Specifically, `e[end]` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

3. **Variable `q`:**
   - `q` is a queue (or similar data structure) that does not contain the element `end`.
   - This is already given and doesn't need adjustment.

4. **Other Variables (`dep`, `pred`, `end`):**
   - These variables are provided and do not directly affect the execution of the loop itself.

### Conclusion:
The critical condition for the loop to execute is that `e[end]` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure this condition holds true.

### Final State Adjustment:
State: **`total` is not relevant, `dep` is a dictionary where each key represents a node and the value is the shortest distance from the starting node, `pred` is a dictionary where each key represents a node and the value is its predecessor in the shortest path, `q` does not contain the element that had been `end`, and `e[end]` must contain at least one element.**

In summary:
State: **`dep` is a dictionary, `pred` is a dictionary, `q` does not contain `end`, and `e[end]` must contain at least one element.**
