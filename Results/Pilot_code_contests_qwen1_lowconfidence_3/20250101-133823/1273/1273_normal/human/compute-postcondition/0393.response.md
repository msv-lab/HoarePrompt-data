`dep[to]` is assigned the value of `dep[cur] + 1`. The value of `dep[cur]` is a non-negative integer, and `to` is associated with `cur` such that its depth is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`q` is a non-empty list or iterable, `cur` is the first element of `q`, `e[cur]` is a non-empty iterable, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`, and `dep[cur]` remains a non-negative integer.**
