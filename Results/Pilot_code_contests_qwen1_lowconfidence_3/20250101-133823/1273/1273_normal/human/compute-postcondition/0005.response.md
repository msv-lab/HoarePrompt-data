`e[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the sublist at index `v` in the list `e`. Since `u` is an input integer and `v` is an input integer, the value of `e[v]` will become a sublist containing the element `[u]`. The variables `i` and `e` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) empty sublists with the sublist at index `u` containing `[v]` and the sublist at index `v` containing `[u]`**
