The line `dep = [-1] * (n + 1)` initializes the list `dep` with `n + 1` elements, each set to `-1`. This operation affects the `dep` list, changing its contents from `[dep[end]]` to `[-1] * (n + 1)`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `center`, `q`, `cur`, `deg`, and `top`) are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`dep` is `[-1, -1, ..., -1]` (a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`), `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is not defined, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`, and `top` is `center`.**
