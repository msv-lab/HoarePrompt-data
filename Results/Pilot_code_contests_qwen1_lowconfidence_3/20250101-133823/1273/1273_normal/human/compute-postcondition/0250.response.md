The code `q = deque([center])` creates a new deque and assigns it to the variable `q`. The deque contains only one element, which is the value of `center`.

Here is the step-by-step analysis:

1. The initial state includes:
   - `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with a `0` at index `center` and all other elements are `-1`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`.
   - `q` is an empty deque.
   - `cur` is not defined.
   - `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`.
   - `top` is `center`.

2. After executing the line `q = deque([center])`, the variable `q` is updated to contain the value of `center`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with a `0` at index `center` and all other elements are `-1`, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is a deque containing the value `center`, `cur` is not defined, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`, and `top` is `center`.**
