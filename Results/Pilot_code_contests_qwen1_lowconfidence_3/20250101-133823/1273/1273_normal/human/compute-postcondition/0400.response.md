Output State: **`q` is a non-empty list or iterable, `cur` is the first element of `q` before the operation, `e[cur]` is an iterable that contains elements whose `dep` value was initially -1, and for each `to` in `e[cur]` where `dep[to]` was initially -1, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to add elements to `q` based on the condition `if dep[to] == -1`. This means that the loop will keep running as long as there are unvisited (initially marked as `-1`) elements in `e[cur]`.
- After the loop completes all its iterations, `q` will contain all the nodes that were reachable from the initial node `cur` following the condition. Each time a new node `to` is added to `q`, its `dep` value is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`, indicating the depth level from the initial node `cur`.
- The variable `cur` remains the first element of `q` because it is set to the next node to process after each iteration, but the initial value of `cur` before the loop starts is preserved.

This final state indicates that `q` now contains a breadth-first traversal sequence starting from `cur`, and `dep` values reflect the distance from `cur` to each node in `q`. If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `e[cur]` is empty or all nodes are already visited), then `q` will still be a non-empty list with the initial `cur` as its first element.
