The code `center = end` assigns the value of the variable `end` to the variable `center`. The value of `end` was the last node added to `q`, and no other changes were made to `end` or `center` before this line of code. Therefore, the value of `center` is now the same as the value of `end`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `bad` remains `False`, `deg[dep[i]]` is updated for each `i` from 1 to `n` if necessary, `cur` is printed with its current value, `end` remains the last node added to `q`, `dep` remains a list of length \(n + 1\) representing the shortest distances, `pred` remains a list of length \(n + 1\) representing the predecessors, `cur` remains the last node processed, `e` remains a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `deg` remains a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is updated if necessary, `bad` remains `False`, and `center` is equal to the last node added to `q`.**
