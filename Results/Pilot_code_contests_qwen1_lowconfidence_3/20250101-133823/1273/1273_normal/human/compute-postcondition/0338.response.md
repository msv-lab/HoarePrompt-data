The `clear` method is called on `q`, which removes all elements from the queue `q`. This operation does not affect the values of `cur`, `e[cur]`, or `top`.

Output State: **`q` is empty, `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` after processing the current `to`; `e[cur]` contains at least one element; `top` is equal to `to`.**
