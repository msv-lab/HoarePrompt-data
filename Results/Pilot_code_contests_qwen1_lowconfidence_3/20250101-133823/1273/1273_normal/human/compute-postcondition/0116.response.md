The code `pred[to] = end` updates the value of the key `to` in the dictionary `pred` to be the value `end`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `dep` remains unchanged, meaning `dep[to]` is still equal to `dep[end] + 1`.
- `pred[to]` is now equal to `end`.
- `q` remains unchanged and does not contain `end`.
- `e[end]` contains at least one element.

Output State: **`dep` is a dictionary, `pred[to]` is equal to `end`, `q` does not contain `end`, and `e[end]` must contain at least one element; `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[end] + 1`**.
