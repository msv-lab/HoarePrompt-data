The code `bad = False` assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `bad`. This assignment does not affect the values of `q`, `cur`, `dep`, or `deg`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`q` is empty, `cur` is the last node processed, `dep` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is the depth level from the initial node in `q`, and `deg` is a list of length `n+1` with all elements initialized to -1; `bad` is False.**
