The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the deque `q`. However, `to` is currently undefined, meaning it has no specific value. Since the value of `to` is not specified, we cannot determine what exactly gets appended to `q`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that `q` now contains an additional undefined element.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `q` is an empty deque plus an undefined element, `cur` is 0, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is -1 except for `dep[cur]` which is 0, `to` is undefined, `pred` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is 0 and `pred[to]` is 0, `end` is 0, `dep[to]` is -1 (since `to` is undefined).**
