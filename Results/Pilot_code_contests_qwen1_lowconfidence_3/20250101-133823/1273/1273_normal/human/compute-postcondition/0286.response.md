The code `cur = q.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element of the deque `q` and assigns it to the variable `cur`. This means that `cur` now holds the value of the first element that was previously in `q`, and `q` loses its leftmost element.

The initial conditions are:
- `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[center]` is `0` and all other elements are `-1`
- `i` is `n`
- `cur` is the farthest node that was processed during the execution of the loop, starting from `center`
- `q` must contain at least one element
- `top` is the node that was most recently updated and set as the new top node during the loop execution
- `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the degree (number of edges) of the corresponding node in the graph represented by `e`

After executing the line of code, the state of the variables changes as follows:
- `cur` is updated to the value of the leftmost element of `q`
- `q` loses its leftmost element

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[center]` is `0` and all other elements are `-1`, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the value of the leftmost element of `q` before the operation, `q` loses its leftmost element, `top` is the node that was most recently updated and set as the new top node during the loop execution, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the degree (number of edges) of the corresponding node in the graph represented by `e`.**
