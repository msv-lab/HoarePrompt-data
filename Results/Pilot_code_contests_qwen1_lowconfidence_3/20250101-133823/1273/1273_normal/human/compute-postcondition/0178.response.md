The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` by adding 1 to the current value of `dep[cur]`. From the initial state, we know that `cur` is `end`, and `dep[end]` is 0. Therefore, `dep[cur]` is also 0. 

After updating `dep[to]`:
- `dep[to]` will be `dep[cur] + 1`, which is `0 + 1` or `1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`total` is 0, `dep[end]` is 0, `i` is 0, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is a deque containing `to` and `to_new`, `cur` is `end`, and `dep[to]` is 1.**
