The `exit()` function is called, which immediately terminates the program without executing any further code. This means that no variables are modified, and the program simply exits.

Output State: **`i` is `n+1`, `deg[dep[i-1]]` is the length of `e[i-1]` for all `i` from `1` to `n` or not equal to `-1`, `bad` remains `False` if any `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to the length of `e[i]` for any `i` from `1` to `n`, and `center` retains its original value. The program has exited.**
