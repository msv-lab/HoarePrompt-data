Output State: **`cur` is the element that was at the front of `q` before `popleft()` was called; `q` is the queue after all elements have been processed, `e[cur]` must contain all reachable nodes starting from the initial node, and `dep[to]` for each `to` in `e[cur]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `cur` is the element that was at the front of `q` before `popleft()` was called.
- As the loop continues, `cur` will eventually become the last element in `q` that was not yet processed.
- The loop appends nodes to `q` whose `dep` value was initially `-1`, meaning they were not yet visited.
- After all iterations, `q` will be empty, as all nodes have been processed.
- All reachable nodes from the initial node (represented by `cur`) will have their `dep` values correctly set to the distance from the initial node.

In the case where the loop does not execute at all (e.g., if `q` is empty when the loop starts), the variables retain their initial states:
- `cur` remains the element that was at the front of `q` before `popleft()` was called.
- `q` remains empty.
- `e[cur]` must contain all reachable nodes from the initial node, but since the loop did not run, `dep[to]` for any `to` in `e[cur]` may not be set.

However, the final state described assumes that the loop has completed its iterations.
