The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the description, it seems that the function should process a tree structure defined by a set of edges where each edge connects two nodes in the tree. The function's input is implied through the constraints and the structure of the tree.

Given the constraints, the function likely reads in the number of nodes `n` and then `n-1` lines of input, each containing two integers `v_i` and `u_i` representing the edges of the tree.

Output:
Case_1: The function processes a tree structure defined by `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, where each edge is represented by two integers `v_i` and `u_i`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a tree structure defined by `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, where each edge is represented by two integers `v_i` and `u_i`.

Functionality: **The function processes a tree structure defined by `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, where each edge is represented by two integers `v_i` and `u_i`.**
