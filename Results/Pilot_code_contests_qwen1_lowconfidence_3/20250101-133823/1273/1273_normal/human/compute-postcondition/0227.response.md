The code `break` does not assign any new values to the variables; instead, it breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is inside. Since there is no loop or conditional statement specified to break out of, the variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`dep[end]` is the shortest distance from `center` to `end`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is not defined, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`, `bad` is `True`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
