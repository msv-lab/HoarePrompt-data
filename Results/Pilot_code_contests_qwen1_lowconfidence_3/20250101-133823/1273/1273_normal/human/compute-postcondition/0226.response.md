`bad` is assigned the value `True`. The value of `bad` changes, while the values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from `center` to `end`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is not defined, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`, `bad` is `True`.
