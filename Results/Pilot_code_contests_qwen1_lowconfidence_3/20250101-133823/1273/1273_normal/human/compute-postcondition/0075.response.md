To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `i` is 0.
- `q` is an empty deque.
- `cur` is 0.
- `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph.
- `n` is the original input value.
- `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is -1 except for `dep[cur]` which is 0.
- `to` is undefined (as it was not used in the code).
- `pred` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is 0.
- `end` is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for to in e[end]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `end`:**
   - The loop iterates over the elements of `e[end]`.
   - For the loop to execute, `e[end]` must contain at least one element because otherwise, the iterator would be empty.
   - Since `end` is 0, we need to check if `e[0]` is non-empty.

2. **Other Variables:**
   - The other variables (`i`, `q`, `cur`, `dep`, `pred`, `to`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop but could be used inside the loop body.
   - `q` being an empty deque and `pred` being all zeros do not prevent the loop from executing as they are not used in this specific loop.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `e[0]` must be non-empty.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is 0, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is -1 except for `dep[cur]` which is 0, `to` is undefined (as it was not used in the code), `pred` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is 0, `end` is 0, `e[0]` must contain at least one element**
