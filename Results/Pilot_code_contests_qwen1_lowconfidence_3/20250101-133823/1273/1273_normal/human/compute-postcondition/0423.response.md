Postcondition: **`cur` is the element that was at the front of `q` before `popleft()` was called, `q` is the original queue with the first element removed and `to` added to the end, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, then `dep[to]` is now `dep[cur] + 1`.**
