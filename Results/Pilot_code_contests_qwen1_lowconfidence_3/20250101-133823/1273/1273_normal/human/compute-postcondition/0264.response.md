Postcondition: ***`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with a `0` at index `center` and all other elements are `-1`. `i` is `n`. `n` is a positive integer. `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`. `q` is either a deque with `to` appended or an empty deque. `cur` is either `center` or `to`. `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`. `top` is either `center` or `to`. `e[center]` contains at least one element, and the current value of `dep[to]` is not `-1`. If `len(e[to]) == 2`, then `q` has `to` appended and `cur` remains `center`. If `len(e[to]) == 1`, then `top` is updated to `to`.***
