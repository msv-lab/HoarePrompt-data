The code `top = to` assigns the value of `to` to the variable `top`. This does not affect the other variables, so the output state remains the same as the initial state with the addition of `top` being set to the value of `to`.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with a `0` at index `center` and all other elements are `-1`, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the next `to` from `e[cur]`, `top` is the value of `to`.**
