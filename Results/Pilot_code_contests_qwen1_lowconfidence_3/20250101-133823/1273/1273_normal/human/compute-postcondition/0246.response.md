Postcondition: ***`dep[end]` is the shortest distance from `center` to `end`, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is not defined, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`, and the value of `end` is printed.*** 

Explanation:
- If `not bad` is true, the value of `end` is printed.
- There is no else part in the code, so the postcondition remains the same as described above.
