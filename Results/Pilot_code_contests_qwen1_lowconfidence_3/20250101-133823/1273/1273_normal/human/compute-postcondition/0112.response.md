The code `end = q.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element of the queue `q`, assigning it to the variable `end`. This operation changes the value of `end` to the current first element of `q`, and `q` loses its first element.

Given the initial state:
- `end` is the value that was at the front of the queue `q` before calling `popleft`.
- `dep` is a dictionary where each key represents a node and the value is the shortest distance from the starting node.
- `pred` is a dictionary where each key represents a node and the value is its predecessor in the shortest path.
- `q` must not be empty.

After executing the code, the variable `end` is updated to the value of the element that was removed from the front of `q`. The value of `q` changes to exclude this element, but the dictionaries `dep` and `pred` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`end` is the value of the element that was removed from the front of `q`; `dep` is a dictionary where each key represents a node and the value is the shortest distance from the starting node; `pred` is a dictionary where each key represents a node and the value is its predecessor in the shortest path; `q` does not contain the element that had been `end`.**
