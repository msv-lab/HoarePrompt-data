The code sets `bad` to `True`. Since `bad` was already True if `deg[dep[2]]` is not equal to the length of `e[2]`, and now `bad` is explicitly set to `True`, the value of `bad` remains `True`.

The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `deg[dep[1]]` remains unchanged, `bad` is True**
