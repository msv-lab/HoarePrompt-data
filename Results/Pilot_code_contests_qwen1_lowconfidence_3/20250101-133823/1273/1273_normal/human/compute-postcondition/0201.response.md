Output State: **`cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` contains all nodes reachable from `cur` with the shortest path length recorded in `dep`, `e[cur]` is empty, and for every node `to` in `q`, `dep[to]` is the shortest distance from `cur` to `to`.** 

Explanation:
- Initially, `cur` is the first element of `q`, and `q` does not contain its first element.
- The loop iterates over each neighbor `to` of `cur` in the adjacency list `e[cur]`.
- If `dep[to]` is `-1`, indicating that `to` has not been visited yet, it sets `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1` and appends `to` to `q`.
- This process continues until all nodes reachable from `cur` have been visited and their distances are calculated.
- Once `e[cur]` is empty, it means all neighbors of `cur` have been processed, and the loop terminates.
- At the end, `q` contains all nodes reachable from `cur`, and `dep` contains the shortest distance from `cur` to each node in `q`.
- `cur` remains the first element of `q` because it is used to start the next round of exploration if necessary (though in this context, it is implied that the loop has finished).

In the case where the loop does not execute, `cur` remains the first element of `q`, and `q` and `dep` do not change from their initial state, meaning no further exploration has taken place.
