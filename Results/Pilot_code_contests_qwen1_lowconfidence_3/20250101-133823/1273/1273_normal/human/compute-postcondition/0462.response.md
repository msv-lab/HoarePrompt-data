The code `print(-1)` prints the value `-1` to the console. However, this does not affect the values of the existing variables (`i`, `n`, `bad`). Therefore, the only change is that the console output will contain `-1`. 

Output State: **`i` is `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and the console prints `-1`.**
