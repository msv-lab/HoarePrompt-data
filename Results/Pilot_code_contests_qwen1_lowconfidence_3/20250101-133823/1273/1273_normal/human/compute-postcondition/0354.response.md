The code initializes `deg` as a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `-1`. This overwrites the previous values of `deg`, setting all its elements to `-1`.

- `dep` remains unchanged, as the code does not affect this variable.
- `i` remains unchanged, as the code does not affect this variable.
- `cur` remains unchanged, as the code does not affect this variable.
- `q` remains unchanged, as the code does not affect this variable.
- `top` remains unchanged, as the code does not affect this variable.

Therefore, the only change is to the `deg` list, which is now a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `-1`.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[center]` is the maximum depth found during the traversal and all other elements are `-1`, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the farthest node from `center` that has been processed, `q` is an empty deque, `top` is the node that was most recently updated and set as the new top node during the loop execution, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are `-1`.**
