The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be the value of `dep[cur]` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

- `cur` is the leftmost element of `q`.
- `q` is the queue without its leftmost element.
- `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.
- The current value of `dep[to]` is -1.

After executing the line of code, `dep[to]` will be updated to `dep[cur] + 1`. Since `dep[cur]` had a previous value (which was not specified in the initial state), we can represent it as `dep[cur]`. Thus, the new value of `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`cur` is the leftmost element of `q`, `q` is the queue without its leftmost element, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and the current value of `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`**
