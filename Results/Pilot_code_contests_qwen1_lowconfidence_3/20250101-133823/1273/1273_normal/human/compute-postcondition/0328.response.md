`top` is assigned the value of `to`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `cur` is the leftmost element of `q`, `q` is not empty, `e[cur]` contains at least one element, and the current value of `dep[to]` is -1, the length of `e[to]` is 1; `top` is equal to `to`.
