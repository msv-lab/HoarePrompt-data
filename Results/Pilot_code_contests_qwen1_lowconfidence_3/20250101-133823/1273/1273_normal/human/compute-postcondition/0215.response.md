The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. This affects the list `q` by adding the value of `to` to its end. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

- `cur` is the leftmost element of the original `q`
- `q` is now the original `q` with the value of `to` appended
- `e[cur]` must contain at least one element
- `dep[new_to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`

Therefore, the Output State is: **`cur` is the leftmost element of the original `q`, `q` is the original `q` with the value of `to` appended, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[new_to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`.**
