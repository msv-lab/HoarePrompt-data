The code initializes the list `dep` with the value `-1` for each index from `0` to `n`. This means that `dep` is now a list of length `n+1` where every element is `-1`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. The initial state includes:
   - `i` is `n+1`
   - `deg[dep[i-1]]` is the length of `e[i-1]` for all `i` from `1` to `n` or not equal to `-1`
   - `bad` remains `False` if any `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to the length of `e[i]` for any `i` from `1` to `n`
   - `center` retains its original value

2. After executing the line `dep = [-1] * (n + 1)`, the value of `dep` changes as described above.

3. No other variables are affected by this code.

Therefore, the updated state after the code execution is:
- `dep` is a list of length `n+1` where every element is `-1`
- `i` is `n+1`
- `deg[dep[i-1]]` is the length of `e[i-1]` for all `i` from `1` to `n` or not equal to `-1`
- `bad` remains `False` if any `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to the length of `e[i]` for any `i` from `1` to `n`
- `center` retains its original value

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1` where every element is `-1`, `i` is `n+1`, `deg[dep[i-1]]` is the length of `e[i-1]` for all `i` from `1` to `n` or not equal to `-1`, `bad` remains `False` if any `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to the length of `e[i]` for any `i` from `1` to `n`, and `center` retains its original value.**
