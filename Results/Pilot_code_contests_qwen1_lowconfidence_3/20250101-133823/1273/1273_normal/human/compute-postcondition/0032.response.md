The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the deque `q`. Since `to` is the second neighbor of `cur` in the list `e[cur]`, appending `to` to `q` increases the size of `q` by one. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `cur` is the first unvisited neighbor of node `1` in the list `e[1]`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) initialized to `-1` except for `dep[1]` which is `0`, `dep[cur]` which is `1`, and `dep[to]` which is `2`, `q` is a deque containing `cur` and `2` and `to`, `to` is now the second neighbor of `cur` in the list `e[cur]`.**
