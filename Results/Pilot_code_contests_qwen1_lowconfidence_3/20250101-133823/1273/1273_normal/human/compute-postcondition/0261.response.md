The code `q.clear()` clears the deque `q`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with a `0` at index `center` and all other elements are `-1`, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is `center`, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`, `top` is now `to`, `e[center]` contains at least one element, and the current value of `dep[to]` is not `-1` and the length of `e[to]` is exactly `1`.**
