Postcondition: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[center]` is `0` and all other elements are `-1`; `i` is either `n` or `n - 1`; `cur` is either the value of the second leftmost element of `q` or the leftmost element of `q` before the operation; `q` either has one more element, which is `to`, or is an empty list; `top` is either the node that was most recently updated and set as the new top node during the loop execution or `to`; `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the degree (number of edges) of the corresponding node in the graph represented by `e`; `cur` must have at least one neighbor in `e[cur]`; if `dep[to]` is `-1`, then `dep[to]` is set to `1`.**
