Postcondition: ***`cur` is the next node in `q`, `q` contains at least one element (a neighbor of `cur`) plus the new element `to`. `i` is 2, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, and if `dep[to]` is initially `-1`, it is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.***
