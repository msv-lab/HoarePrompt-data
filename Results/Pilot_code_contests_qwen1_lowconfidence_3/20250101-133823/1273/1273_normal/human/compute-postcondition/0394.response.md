The code appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. This means that the list `q` now contains the original first element `cur` followed by `to`.

The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`q` is a non-empty list with the first element being `cur` and the second element being `to`, `cur` is the first element of `q`, `e[cur]` is a non-empty iterable, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`, and `dep[cur]` remains a non-negative integer.**
