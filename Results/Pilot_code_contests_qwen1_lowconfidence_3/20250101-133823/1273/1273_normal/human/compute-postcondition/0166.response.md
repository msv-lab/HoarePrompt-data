Let's analyze the loop and the provided output states step by step.

### Initial State
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `bad` remains `False`
- `deg[dep[i]]` is updated for each `i` from 1 to `n` if necessary
- `cur` is printed with its current value
- `end` remains the last node added to `q`
- `dep` remains a list of length \(n + 1\) representing the shortest distances
- `pred` remains a list of length \(n + 1\) representing the predecessors
- `cur` remains the last node processed
- `e` remains a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph
- `deg` remains a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is updated if necessary
- `bad` remains `False`
- `center` is equal to the last node added to `q`

### Loop Code
```
for i in range(dep[end] // 2):
    center = pred[center]
```

### Analysis of the Loop
- The loop runs `dep[end] // 2` times.
- Each iteration updates `center` to the value stored at the index `center` in the `pred` list.

### Output States After Some Iterations
- **After 1 iteration:** `i` is 0, `dep[end]` must be greater than 1, `center` is the value at index `center` in the list `pred`.
- **After 2 iterations:** `i` is 1, `dep[end]` must be greater than 1, `center` is the value at index `center` in the list `pred`.
- **After 3 iterations:** `i` is 2, `dep[end]` must be greater than 2, `center` is the value at index `center` in the list `pred` and it has been updated to the new value from that index.

From these output states, we can deduce that:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `dep[end]` is greater than the number of iterations performed so far (i.e., `2 * i`).

### Determining the Final Output State
To determine the final output state, let's consider the worst-case scenario where the loop does not execute at all and the best-case scenario where the loop executes until `dep[end]` is no longer greater than `dep[end] // 2`.

#### Case 1: The Loop Does Not Execute
- If `dep[end]` is less than or equal to 1, the loop will not execute.
- Variables:
  - `i` remains `n + 1`
  - `center` remains the last node added to `q` (which is `center` initially)

#### Case 2: The Loop Executes Until the End
- Let's assume `dep[end]` is `k` where `k > 1`.
- The loop will run `k // 2` times.
- Each iteration updates `center` to the value at the index `center` in the `pred` list.
- After `k // 2` iterations, `center` will be updated to the node that is `k // 2` steps back from the initial `center`.

### Final Output State
The final value of `center` will be the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center`. Therefore, the output state of the loop is:

Output State: **`i` is the final value of `i` after the loop, which is `dep[end] // 2`, `dep[end]` must be at least `2 * i + 1`, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`.**
