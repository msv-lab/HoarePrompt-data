The code `pred[to] = end` assigns the value of `end` to `pred[to]`. Since `to` is undefined, the assignment does not affect any specific indexed element in the `pred` list. However, it sets `pred[to]` to `end`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `q` is a non-empty deque, `cur` is 0, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is -1 except for `dep[cur]` which is 0, `to` is undefined, `pred` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is 0 and `pred[to]` is set to `end`, `end` points to a node with neighbors, and `dep[end]` remains -1.**
