Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cur` is the next element in `q`.
   - `q` is updated to include the first element removed and `to` added to the end.
   - `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.
   - `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`. If `dep[to]` was `-1`, it is already updated.
   - `q` now contains the elements of the original `q` with `to` appended.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for to in e[cur]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each `to` in `e[cur]`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `to` must be a valid next node to process.
   - After the previous iteration, `e[cur]` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.
   - The variable `cur` remains the same as it is the starting point of the loop.

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - `cur` remains the same.
   - `q` is updated and now includes the elements of the original `q` with `to` appended. Therefore, `q` will be checked to ensure it still contains valid elements for the next iteration.
   - `e[cur]` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.
   - `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` if it was `-1` before. This value is already updated, so no further action is needed for this specific state.

Given these points, we can adjust the states as follows:

State: **`cur` is the next element in `q`, `q` must now contain valid elements, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is already updated if it was `-1`.**

Since `to` is determined within the loop body and not explicitly stated in the given information, we focus on the conditions for the loop to continue.

Final State: **`cur` is the next element in `q`, `q` must now contain valid elements, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.**
