The code `end = cur` assigns the current value of `cur` to `end`. The value of `cur` is 0, so `end` will also be 0. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `q` is a deque containing 0, `cur` is 0, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is -1 except for `dep[cur]` which is 0, `to` is the last node that was added to the deque `q` if it exists (which in this case does not exist as `q` was just initialized), and `pred` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is 0; `end` is 0.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` is a deque containing 0, `cur` is 0, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is -1 except for `dep[cur]` which is 0, `to` is the last node that was added to the deque `q` if it exists (which in this case does not exist as `q` was just initialized), `pred` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is 0, `end` is 0.**
