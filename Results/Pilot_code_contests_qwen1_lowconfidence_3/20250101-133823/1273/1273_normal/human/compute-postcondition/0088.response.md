`pred[to]` is assigned the value of `end`. The value of `dep[to]` is updated to be `dep[end] + 1`. The values of `dep`, `to`, and `end` remain unchanged from their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 1`, `pred[to]` is `end`, `dep`, `to`, and `end` retain their previous values.**
