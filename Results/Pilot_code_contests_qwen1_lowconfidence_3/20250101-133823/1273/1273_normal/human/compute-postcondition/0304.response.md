The code `q.clear()` clears the list `q`. Since `q` was either containing `to` or was an empty list, after executing this line, `q` becomes an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[center]` is `0` and all other elements are `-1` except `dep[to]` which is `1`, `i` is either `n` or `n - 1`, `cur` is either the value of the second leftmost element of `q` or the leftmost element of `q` before the operation, `q` is an empty list, `top` is `to`, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the degree (number of edges) of the corresponding node in the graph represented by `e`, and `cur` must have at least one neighbor in `e[cur]`.**
