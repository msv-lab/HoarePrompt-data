Postcondition: ***`end` is the value that was at the front of the queue `q` before calling `popleft`, and `dep[to]` is updated such that if `dep[to]` was -1 (indicating the node was not visited), it is now set to `dep[end] + 1`. The predecessor of `to` (`pred[to]`) is set to `end`. `q` now contains all its previous elements plus `to`.***
