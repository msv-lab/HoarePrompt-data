`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. Given that `dep[cur]` is the distance from node `1` to node `cur`, and `dep[to]` was previously `-1`, after this line of code, `dep[to]` will be `dep[cur] + 1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cur` is the first element in the deque `q` after it has been removed, `q` is the deque with its first element removed, `i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, `to` is the last node added to the deque `q`, and `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`.**
