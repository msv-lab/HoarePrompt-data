`q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `end` is the value that was at the front of the queue `q` before calling `popleft`, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[end] + 1`, `pred[to]` is set to `end`, `q` now contains all its previous elements plus `to`, and `e[end]` must contain at least one element. After executing the code, the value of `q` changes to include the new element `to`.

Output State: **`end` is the value that was at the front of the queue `q` before calling `popleft`, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[end] + 1`, `pred[to]` is set to `end`, `q` now contains all its previous elements plus `to`, and `e[end]` must contain at least one element, `q` now includes `to`.**
