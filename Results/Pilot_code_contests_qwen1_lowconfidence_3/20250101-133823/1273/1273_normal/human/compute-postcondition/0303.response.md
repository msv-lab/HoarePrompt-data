The code `top = to` assigns the value of `to` to the variable `top`. No other changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[center]` is `0` and all other elements are `-1` except `dep[to]` which is `1`, `i` is either `n` or `n - 1`, `cur` is either the value of the second leftmost element of `q` or the leftmost element of `q` before the operation, `q` either has one more element, which is `to`, or is an empty list, `top` is `to`, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the degree (number of edges) of the corresponding node in the graph represented by `e`, and `cur` must have at least one neighbor in `e[cur]`**.
