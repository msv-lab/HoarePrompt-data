The code creates a deque object `q` and initializes it with the value of `cur`. The value of `cur` is known to be 0 from the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` is a deque containing 0, `cur` is 0, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is -1 except for `dep[cur]` which is 0, `to` is the last node that was added to the deque `q` if it exists (which in this case does not exist as `q` was just initialized), and `pred` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is 0.**
