Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `cur` is the first unvisited neighbor of node `1` in the list `e[1]`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) initialized to `-1` except for `dep[1]` which is `0`, `dep[cur]` which is `1`, and `dep[to]` which is `2`, `q` is a deque containing `cur` and `2` and `to`, `to` is now the second neighbor of `cur` in the list `e[cur]`. If `dep[to]` equals `-1`, `dep[to]` is set to `2`.***
