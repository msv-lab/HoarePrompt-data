Postcondition: ***`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with a `0` at index `center` and all other elements are `-1`, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the next `to` from `e[cur]`, `top` is the value of `to`, `q` is an empty list. If `len(e[to]) == 1`, then `q` remains unchanged as an empty list. Otherwise, there is no change in the specified variables' values.***
