`cur` is assigned the value of `q.popleft()`, which removes and returns the leftmost element of the deque `q`. Since `q` initially contains only the element `end`, `cur` will be set to `end`, and `q` will be empty afterward.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated states are as follows:

- `dep[end]` is still `0`
- `i` is still `0`
- `center` remains the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`
- `q` is now an empty deque

Output State: **`dep[end]` is 0, `i` is 0, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is `end`**
