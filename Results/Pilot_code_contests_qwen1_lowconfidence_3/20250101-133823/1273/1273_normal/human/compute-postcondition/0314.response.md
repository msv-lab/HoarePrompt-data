The code `break` does not affect any variable's value and instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since there is no loop or if statement in the given code snippet, it simply ends the current execution flow without changing any variable values.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[center]` is `0` and all other elements are `-1` except `dep[to]` which is `1`, `i` is either `n` or `n - 1`, `cur` is the next valid node in `e[cur]` such that `len(e[cur]) == 2`, `q` is an empty list, `top` is `to`, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the degree (number of edges) of the corresponding node in the graph represented by `e`.**
