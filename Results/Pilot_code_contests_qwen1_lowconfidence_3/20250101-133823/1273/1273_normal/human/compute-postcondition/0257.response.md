`q` is appended with the value of `to`. The value of `to` is known to be such that `dep[to]` is `1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with a `0` at index `center` and all other elements are `-1`, `dep[to]` is `1`, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is a deque with `to` appended, `cur` is `center`, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`, `top` is `center`, the current value of `e[to]` contains exactly two elements, the current value of `dep[to]` is `-1`.**
