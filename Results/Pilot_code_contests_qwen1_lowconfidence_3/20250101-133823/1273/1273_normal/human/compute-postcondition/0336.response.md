The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. This means the list `q` now contains an additional element, which is `to`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`; `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` after processing the current `to`; `q` is non-empty and contains at least its original elements plus `to`; `e[cur]` contains at least one element and the first element is `to`.**
