Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 2
   - `deg[dep[1]]` remains unchanged
   - `bad` is True unless `deg[dep[1]]` is not equal to the length of `e[2]`, in which case `bad` becomes False
   - `deg[dep[1]]` remains the same as it was not modified inside the loop body
   - `bad` remains the same unless the loop body changes its value

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`

3. **Current Iteration**: 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 3.

4. **Loop Body Impact**:
   - The loop body is omitted, meaning no explicit modifications are made to `deg[dep[1]]` or `bad` within the loop itself.
   - However, the condition for `bad` to change is based on `deg[dep[1]]` being compared to the length of `e[2]`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop body does not explicitly change `deg[dep[1]]` or `bad`, their values remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, `deg[dep[1]]` remains unchanged and `bad` remains the same as it was not modified in the loop body.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the value of `i` which should be incremented to 3.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `deg[dep[1]]` remains unchanged, and `bad` remains the same unless the loop body changes its value.**
