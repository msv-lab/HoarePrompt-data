The code assigns the value of `end` to `pred[to]`. Based on the initial state, `end` was the value at the front of the queue `q` before calling `popleft`, and `dep[to]` was -1 (indicating that `to` was not visited). After executing the code, `pred[to]` is updated to `end`, and since `to` was not visited, `dep[to]` remains -1.

Output State: **`end` is the value that was at the front of the queue `q` before calling `popleft`, and `dep[end]` must contain at least one element; `dep[to]` is now `dep[end] + 1`; `pred[to]` is `end`; the node `to` is currently not visited, indicated by `dep[to]` being -1.**
