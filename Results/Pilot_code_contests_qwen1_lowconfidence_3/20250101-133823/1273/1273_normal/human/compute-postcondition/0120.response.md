The code `dep[to] = dep[end] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be the value of `dep[end]` plus 1. Given the initial state, we know that `dep[end]` is a specific value. Therefore, `dep[to]` will be updated to be `dep[end] + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a dictionary, `pred[to]` is equal to `end`, `q` contains `to` (appended), `e[end]` must contain at least two elements; `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[end] + 1`.**
