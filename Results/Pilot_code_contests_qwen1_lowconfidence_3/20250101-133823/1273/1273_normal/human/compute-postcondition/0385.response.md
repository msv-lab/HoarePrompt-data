To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions step by step.

### Given Information:

1. **`dep`**: A list of length `n+1` where every element is `-1` except `dep[n+1]` which is `0`.
2. **`i`**: `i` is set to `n+1`.
3. **`deg[dep[i-1]]`**: The value of `deg[dep[i-1]]` is the length of `e[i-1]` for all `i` from `1` to `n` or not equal to `-1`.
4. **`bad`**: `bad` remains `False` if any `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to the length of `e[i]` for any `i` from `1` to `n`.
5. **`center`**: `center` retains its original value.
6. **`q`**: `q` is a deque containing the value of `top`.

### Loop Condition:

The loop condition is `while q:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `q` is not empty.

### Analysis:

- For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must not be empty. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `q`.

### Conclusion:

To allow the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, `q` must contain at least one element. 

### Final Answer:

State: **`q` is not empty**
