`i` is assigned the value 1, and `deg[dep[i]]` is equal to -1. The code updates `deg[dep[i]]` to be the length of `e[i]`. Since `i` is 1, `deg[dep[1]]` is updated to be the length of `e[1]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `deg[dep[1]]` is equal to the length of `e[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `deg[dep[1]]` is equal to the length of `e[1]`**
