According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `to` and the value of `e[cur]`. The loop will iterate over each element in `e[cur]`. Before the loop starts, `q` is a non-empty list with its first element removed, and `cur` is the first element of the original `q`.

To ensure the loop can execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. `e[cur]` must contain at least one element because if it is empty, the loop will not execute.
2. `cur` should still hold the value of the first element of the original `q` since it is used as the key in the dictionary `e`.
3. `q` is already a non-empty list with its first element removed, so we don't need to adjust this directly unless there's additional context about `q` changing during the loop, which is not mentioned.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `e[cur]` must have at least one element.
- `cur` must be the first element of the original `q`.

State: **`q` is a non-empty list (with its first element removed), `cur` is the first element of the original `q`, `e[cur]` must have at least one element**
