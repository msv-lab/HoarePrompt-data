State before the loop starts: `cur` is the leftmost element of `q`; `q` is the queue without its leftmost element.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop iterates over `to` which is an element from the set `e[cur]`.
2. For the loop to execute, the set `e[cur]` must contain at least one element. If `e[cur]` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, we need to ensure that the set `e[cur]` contains at least one element.

State: **`cur` is the leftmost element of `q`, `q` is the queue without its leftmost element, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element**
