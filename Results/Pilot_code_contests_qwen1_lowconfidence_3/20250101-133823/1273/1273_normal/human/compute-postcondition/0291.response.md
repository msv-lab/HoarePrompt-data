`q` is appended with the value of `to`. This means that the leftmost element of `q` was removed, and now `to` is added to the end of `q`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[center]` is `0` and all other elements are `-1`; `i` is `n`; `cur` is the value of the second leftmost element of `q` before the operation; `q` now has one more element, which is `to`; `top` is the node that was most recently updated and set as the new top node during the loop execution; `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the degree (number of edges) of the corresponding node in the graph represented by `e`; `cur` must have at least one neighbor in `e[cur]`; `dep[to]` is `1`.
