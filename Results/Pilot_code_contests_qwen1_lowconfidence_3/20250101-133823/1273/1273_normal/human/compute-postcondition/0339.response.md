The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `q`, `cur`, `e[cur]`, and `top`. It only breaks out of the current loop or nested structure it is within. Since no specific loop or nested structure is mentioned in the initial state, we assume this `break` statement does not change the values of the given variables.

Output State: **`q` is empty, `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` after processing the current `to`; `e[cur]` contains at least one element; `top` is equal to `to`.**
