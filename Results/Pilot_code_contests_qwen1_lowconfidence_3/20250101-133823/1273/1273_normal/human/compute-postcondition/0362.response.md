The code `break` is executed, which does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `deg[dep[i]]`, `bad`, or `deg[dep[i]]`. It simply breaks out of the current loop or switch-case structure.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to -1, `bad` is True, and `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to the length of `e[i]`**
