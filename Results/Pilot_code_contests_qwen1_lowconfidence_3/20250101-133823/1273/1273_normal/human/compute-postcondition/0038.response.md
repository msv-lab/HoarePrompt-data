Postcondition: **`cur` is the first element in the deque `q` after it has been removed, `q` is the deque with its first element removed, `i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, `to` is the last node added to the deque `q`, and the value of `dep[to]` is `-1`**
