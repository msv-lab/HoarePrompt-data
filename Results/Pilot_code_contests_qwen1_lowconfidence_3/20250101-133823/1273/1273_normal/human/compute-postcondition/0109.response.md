Postcondition: ***`end` is the value that was at the front of the queue `q` before calling `popleft`. If `dep[to]` equals -1, then `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[end] + 1`, `pred[to]` is set to `end`, and `q` now contains all its previous elements plus `to`. If `dep[to]` does not equal -1, the conditions remain unchanged.***
