According to the given code, the loop iterates over the elements in `e[cur]`. The loop can continue executing as long as `e[cur]` contains elements. At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions were true:
- `q` is a non-empty list with the first element being `cur` and the second element being `to`.
- `cur` is the first element of `q`.
- `e[cur]` is a non-empty iterable.
- `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.
- `dep[cur]` remains a non-negative integer.

For the loop to execute one more time, `e[cur]` must still contain at least one element. This means that `e[cur]` should now be an iterable with at least one element remaining.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

State: **`q` is a non-empty list with the first element being `cur` and the second element being `to`, `cur` is the first element of `q`, `e[cur]` is a non-empty iterable with at least one element, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`, and `dep[cur]` remains a non-negative integer.**
