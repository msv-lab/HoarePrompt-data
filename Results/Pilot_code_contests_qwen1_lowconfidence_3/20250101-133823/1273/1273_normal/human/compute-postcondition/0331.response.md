Postcondition: **`cur` is the leftmost element of `q`, `q` is not empty, `e[cur]` contains at least one element, and the current value of `dep[to]` is -1, and the length of `e[to]` is either 1 or not equal to 2. Additionally, if `len(e[to]) == 1`, then `top` is equal to `to` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
