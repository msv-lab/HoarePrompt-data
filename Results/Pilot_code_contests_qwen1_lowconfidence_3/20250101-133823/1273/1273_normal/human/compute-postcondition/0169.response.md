The code initializes a deque `q` with the value `end`. The other variables (`dep`, `i`, `center`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is that a deque `q` is now initialized with `end`.

Output State: **`dep[end]` is 0, `i` is the final value of `i` after the loop, which is `dep[end] // 2`, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is a deque containing `end`, and `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are `-1` except for `dep[end]` which is `0`.**
