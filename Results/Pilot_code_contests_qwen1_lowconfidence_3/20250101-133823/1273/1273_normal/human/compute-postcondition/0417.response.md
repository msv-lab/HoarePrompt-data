To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition under which the loop continues. The given `while` loop condition is:

```python
while q:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means the loop continues as long as the list `q` is not empty.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `q` is a non-empty list containing all nodes reachable from `cur` in the graph.
- `cur` is the first element of the original `q`.
- `e[cur]` is the adjacency list of `cur`.
- `dep` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is the depth level from `cur`, and `dep[cur]` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must not be empty. Since `q` is described as a non-empty list at the start, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `q` remains non-empty for the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Condition**: `q` is a non-empty list.
2. **Loop Execution**: The loop body processes elements of `q` one by one.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, `q` must still contain at least one element after processing.

Since `q` is non-empty at the start and the loop processes elements one by one, `q` will become empty only when all elements have been processed. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `q` must still contain at least one element.

### Adjusted State:
- `q` must contain at least one element.

Thus, the state for the next iteration should be adjusted to reflect this requirement.

**State:**
**`q` must contain at least one element.**
