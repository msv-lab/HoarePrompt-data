The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `dep` is a dictionary, `pred[to]` is equal to `end`, `q` contains the value of `to` appended to its existing elements, and `e[end]` must contain at least one element; `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[end] + 1`.

Output State: **`dep` is a dictionary, `pred[to]` is equal to `end`, `q` contains `to` (appended), and `e[end]` must contain at least one element; `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[end] + 1`**
