The code initializes `cur` to 1. This does not change the value of `cur`, but sets it to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists where each sublist at index `u` contains all `v` such that there is a bidirectional edge between `u` and `v`, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to `-1` except for `dep[1]` which is now `0`, `q` is a deque containing `[1]`, `cur` is `1`.**
