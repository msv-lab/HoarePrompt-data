Functionality: **The function processes a tree structure defined by \( n \) nodes and \( n-1 \) edges. It constructs the adjacency list representation of the tree and then performs several operations to find a valid central node in the tree. Specifically, it first computes the shortest distance from the root node (node 1) to all other nodes and identifies a candidate central node. It then verifies certain properties of the tree to ensure the candidate node is indeed the central node. If no such node can be found, the function prints -1. The function handles the case where the tree is valid and all distances and degrees are consistent, ensuring that the central node meets the criteria of being a centroid (a node whose removal splits the tree into subtrees each having no more than half the nodes).**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- **Edge Case:** If the tree is not valid (e.g., if the input edges do not form a valid tree or if there are inconsistencies in the degrees of nodes), the function may not handle these cases properly. For example, if there are duplicate edges or isolated nodes, the function might fail to produce the correct output.
- **Missing Functionality:** The function does not explicitly check for the validity of the input edges forming a tree. It assumes the input is correct and focuses on finding the central node. However, a thorough validation step would be needed to ensure the input forms a valid tree structure before proceeding with the main algorithm.
- **Edge Case:** If the tree is trivial (i.e., consists of a single node), the function should correctly identify this node as the central node. However, the current implementation does not handle this specific case explicitly.
- **Edge Case:** If multiple nodes could potentially be considered as central nodes due to the symmetric nature of the tree, the function currently picks one arbitrarily. A more robust solution would be to return all such nodes if they exist.
