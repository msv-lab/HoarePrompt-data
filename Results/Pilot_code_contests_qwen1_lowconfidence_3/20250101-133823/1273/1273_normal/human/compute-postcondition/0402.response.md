`cur` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `q` using `popleft()`, which removes this element from `q`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a non-empty list (with its first element removed), `cur` is the first element of the original `q`.

Output State: **`q` is a non-empty list (with its first element removed), `cur` is the first element of the original `q`**
