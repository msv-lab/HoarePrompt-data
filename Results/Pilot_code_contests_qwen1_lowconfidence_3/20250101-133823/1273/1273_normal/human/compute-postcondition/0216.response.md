Postcondition: ***`cur` is the leftmost element of the original `q`, `q` is the original `q` with the value of `to` appended, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[new_to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`. Since the else part is not present, this is the final state of the program after the if-else block executes.***
