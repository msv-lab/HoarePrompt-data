State before the loop starts: `cur` is the element that was at the front of `q` before `popleft()` was called; `q` is the original queue with the first element removed.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop is iterating over the elements in `e[cur]`.
2. For the loop to execute, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element. If `e[cur]` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `cur` is the element that was at the front of `q` before `popleft()` was called.
- `q` is the original queue with the first element removed.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `e[cur]` contains at least one element.

State: **`cur` is the element that was at the front of `q` before `popleft()` was called, `q` is the original queue with the first element removed, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element**
