The code updates the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1`. Based on the initial state, `dep[cur]` is a non-negative integer and `dep[to]` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a non-empty list with the first element being `cur` and the second element being `to`, `cur` is the first element of `q`, `e[cur]` is a non-empty iterable with at least one element, `dep[cur]` remains a non-negative integer, `dep[to]` is now `dep[cur] + 1`.**
