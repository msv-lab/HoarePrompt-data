`i` is initially 3, so `deg[dep[i]]` is updated to `len(e[i])`. The value of `i` is 3, which means `deg[dep[3]]` is set to `len(e[3])`. The value of `deg[dep[1]]` remains unchanged, and `bad` remains the same unless the loop body changes its value.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `deg[dep[3]]` is `len(e[3])`, `deg[dep[1]]` remains unchanged, and `bad` remains the same unless the loop body changes its value.**
