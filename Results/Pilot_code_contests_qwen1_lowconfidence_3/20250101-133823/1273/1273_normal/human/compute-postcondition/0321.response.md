Let's break down the given information and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- **State before the loop**: 
  - `cur` is the leftmost element of `q`.
  - `q` has one less element than before.

- **For Loop**:
  ```
  for to in e[cur]:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over the elements of `e[cur]`.
   - For the loop to execute, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element. 

2. **Current State of Variables**:
   - `cur` is the leftmost element of `q`.
   - `q` has one less element than before, implying that `q` is not empty (since if `q` was empty, `cur` would not exist).

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - We need to ensure that `cur` is valid (i.e., `q` is not empty) and that `e[cur]` contains at least one element.

### Conclusion:
The necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:
- Ensure that `q` is not empty (since `cur` is derived from `q`).
- Ensure that `e[cur]` contains at least one element.

Given that `q` has one less element than before, we can infer that `q` still has at least one element (otherwise, `cur` wouldn't be defined). Therefore, the key adjustment needed is to ensure `e[cur]` contains at least one element.

### Final Answer:
State: **`cur` is the leftmost element of `q`, `q` is not empty, and `e[cur]` must contain at least one element**.
