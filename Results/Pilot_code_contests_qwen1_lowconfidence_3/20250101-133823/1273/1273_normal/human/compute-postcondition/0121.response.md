`pred[to]` is assigned the value `end`. This updates the dictionary `pred` with the key `to` mapping to the value `end`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dep` is a dictionary, `pred[to]` is equal to `end`, `q` contains `to` (appended), `e[end]` must contain at least two elements; `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[end] + 1`, `pred[to]` is now equal to `end`.
