The code initializes a list `deg` with `-1` for each index from `0` to `n`. The initial state includes the following variables:

- `q` is empty.
- `cur` is the last node processed.
- `dep` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is the depth level from the initial node in `q`.

After executing the line `deg = [-1] * (n + 1)`, the variable `deg` is updated with the new list. The values of `q`, `cur`, and `dep` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`q` is empty, `cur` is the last node processed, `dep` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is the depth level from the initial node in `q`, and `deg` is a list of length `n+1` with all elements initialized to -1.**
