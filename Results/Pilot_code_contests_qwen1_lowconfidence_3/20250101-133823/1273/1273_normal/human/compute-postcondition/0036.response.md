`cur` is assigned the value of the first element in the deque `q` using `popleft()`. This operation removes the first element from the deque `q`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`cur` is the first element in the deque `q` after it has been removed, `q` is the deque with its first element removed, `i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is set to the distance from node `1` to that node, `to` is the last node added to the deque `q`.**
