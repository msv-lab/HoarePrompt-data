Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `q` is a non-empty deque, `cur` is 0, `e` is a list of \(n + 1\) sublists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `n` is the original input value, `dep` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is -1 except for `dep[cur]` which is 0, `to` is undefined, `pred` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is 0 and `pred[to]` is set to `end` (or remains 0 if `to` is undefined), `end` points to a node with neighbors, and `dep[end]` remains -1. This is true regardless of whether `dep[to]` was -1 or not because the `else` part does not change the state when `dep[to]` is not -1.***
