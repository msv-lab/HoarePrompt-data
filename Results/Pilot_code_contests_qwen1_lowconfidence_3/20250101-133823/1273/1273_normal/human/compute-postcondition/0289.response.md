Postcondition: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[center]` is `0` and all other elements are `-1`. `i` is `n`. `cur` is the value of the leftmost element of `q` before the operation. `q` loses its leftmost element. `top` is the node that was most recently updated and set as the new top node during the loop execution. `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the degree (number of edges) of the corresponding node in the graph represented by `e`. `cur` must have at least one neighbor in `e[cur]`. `dep[to]` is `0` since `dep[to]` was previously `-1`. The current value of `to` has exactly two neighbors in the graph `e`.**
