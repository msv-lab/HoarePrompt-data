The code updates the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1`. Given the initial state, `cur` is `end`, and `dep[cur]` (which is `dep[end]`) is 0. Therefore, `dep[to]` will be updated to `0 + 1`, which is 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. So, the updated values are:
- `dep[to]` is now 1
- All other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `dep[end]` is 0, `i` is 0, `center` is the node that is `dep[end] // 2` steps back from the initial `center` in the list `pred`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is `end`, `dep[to]` is 1, and `e[cur]` must be non-empty, and the value of `dep[to]` is 1.**
