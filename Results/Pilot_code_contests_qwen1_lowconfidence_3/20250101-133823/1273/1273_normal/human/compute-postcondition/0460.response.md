The code `exit()` is used to terminate the program immediately without further execution of the remaining code. This means that no changes are made to any of the variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, `top` is its initial value, `bad` is `False` if there exists any `j` (where `1 ≤ j ≤ n`) such that `deg[dep[j]]` is not equal to `len(e[j])`, otherwise `bad` is `False`**
