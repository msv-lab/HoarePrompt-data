Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find a root vertex in a tree that satisfies the given condition. However, there are issues with the logic and handling of the tree structure, which may lead to incorrect results.

One issue is in the way the `deg` array is being used to check the degrees of vertices at different distances from the current root candidate. The logic seems overly complex and might not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not thoroughly check all possible candidates for the root vertex and might miss valid solutions.

To illustrate this, consider the following input:

```
7
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
3 6
6 7
```

The expected output is `3`, as explained in the problem statement. However, the provided code does not correctly identify `3` as a valid root vertex. Instead, it might incorrectly conclude that no valid root vertex exists, leading to an output of `-1`.

A simpler and more robust approach would be to use a centroid decomposition or a similar method to ensure that all potential root candidates are checked correctly. The current implementation may fail in cases where the tree structure is more complex, leading to incorrect results.
