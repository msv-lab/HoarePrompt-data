You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have given tree consist of n vertices. Select a vertex as root vertex that satisfies the condition below.

  * For all vertices v_{1} and v_{2}, if distance(root, v_{1}) = distance(root, v_{2}) then degree(v_{1}) = degree(v_{2}), where degree means the number of vertices connected to that vertex, and distance means the number of edges between two vertices. 



Determine and find if there is such root vertex in the tree. If there are multiple answers, find any of them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}) — the number of vertices.

Each of the next n-1 lines contains two integers v_{i} and u_{i} (1 ≤ v_{i} < u_{i} ≤ n) — it means there is an edge exist between v_{i} and u_{i}. It is guaranteed that the graph forms tree.

Output

If there is such root vertex exists, print any of them. Otherwise, print -1.

Examples

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider trees where the solution is not unique or does not exist. Here is a case where the program might fail:

Consider the following input:
```
4
1 2
2 3
3 4
```

In this case, the tree is a straight line, and any vertex can be a valid root vertex since the distances and degrees will satisfy the condition. However, the program will output -1, which is incorrect because any of the vertices (1, 2, 3, 4) can be a valid root vertex.

To fix this, the program needs to check all possible vertices to ensure that the condition is met for each one before concluding that there is no valid root vertex. The current implementation only checks a few specific vertices and may miss valid solutions.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function does not explicitly check for the validity of the input edges forming a tree. It assumes the input is correct and focuses on finding the central node. However, a thorough validation step would be needed to ensure the input forms a valid tree structure before proceeding with the main algorithm.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
