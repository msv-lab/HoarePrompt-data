Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem but does not correctly implement the logic required to meet the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to correctly identify if there is a root vertex that satisfies the given conditions and prints the correct result accordingly.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Depth Calculation and Degree Matching:**
   - The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to calculate depths and degrees, but it incorrectly updates and checks these values.
   - The program performs multiple DFS traversals and uses complex logic to update degrees and check for consistency, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Logic for Identifying Valid Root Vertex:**
   - The program tries to use multiple DFS traversals to find a valid root vertex, but the logic is overly complicated and does not ensure that the conditions are met correctly.
   - The program does not properly handle the case where there might be multiple valid root vertices or when no valid root vertex exists.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when the tree is a simple path or when there are multiple nodes with the same degree at the same depth.
   - It does not correctly determine if a node satisfies the condition that for all vertices \(v_1\) and \(v_2\), if \(distance(root, v_1) = distance(root, v_2)\) then \(degree(v_1) = degree(v_2)\).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, one should:
1. Identify the central node(s) of the tree, typically by finding the centroid (if the tree is unbalanced, there might be multiple centroids).
2. Check if the selected central node satisfies the condition for all vertices at the same distance having the same degree.
3. Print the node if it satisfies the condition, otherwise print `-1`.

### Why the Given Program is Incorrect:
- The program's approach is overly complex and does not correctly implement the logic needed to verify the condition for all vertices.
- It does not correctly identify the central node(s) of the tree.
- The logic for checking the condition is not implemented correctly, leading to potential incorrect results.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description and hence is **False**.
