Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider trees where the solution is not unique or does not exist. Here is a case where the program might fail:

Consider the following input:
```
4
1 2
2 3
3 4
```

In this case, the tree is a straight line, and any vertex can be a valid root vertex since the distances and degrees will satisfy the condition. However, the program will output -1, which is incorrect because any of the vertices (1, 2, 3, 4) can be a valid root vertex.

To fix this, the program needs to check all possible vertices to ensure that the condition is met for each one before concluding that there is no valid root vertex. The current implementation only checks a few specific vertices and may miss valid solutions.
