Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the code does not validate whether the input forms a valid tree structure. As per the problem statement, the input should form a tree, meaning it should be a connected acyclic graph. The code assumes the input is correct without checking this fundamental property. 

For instance, consider the following invalid input:
```
Input:
4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 2
```
This input does not form a valid tree because there is a cycle (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2). The code would proceed to execute its logic without detecting this issue, potentially leading to incorrect results or infinite loops.

To fix this, the code should include a step to verify that the input forms a valid tree. Additionally, the logic for finding the root vertex needs to be more robust and ensure that all conditions are met as described in the problem statement.
