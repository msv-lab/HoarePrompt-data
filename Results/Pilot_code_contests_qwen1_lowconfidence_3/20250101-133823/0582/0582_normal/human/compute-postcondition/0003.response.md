`ans[x][dep]` is assigned the value `{ss[x]}`, where `ss[x]` is a specific value. The value of `x` is not 0, and the values of `dep` and `nowChild[x]` are lists, but the specific contents of these lists are not specified. The value of `lenChild[x]` is equal to the value of `nowChild[x]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ans[x][dep]` is `{ss[x]}`, `x` is not 0, `dep` is a list of pairs, `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, and the value of `x` is not 0.**
