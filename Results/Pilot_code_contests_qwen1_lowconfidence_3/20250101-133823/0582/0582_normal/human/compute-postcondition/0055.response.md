`ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. According to the initial state, `ans[x][j]` is the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list. After this assignment, `ans[fa[x]][j]` will be updated to be equal to `ans[x][j]`. The states of other elements in `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans[x][j]` is the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is equal to `ans[x][j]`; `ans[x]` retains its other elements unchanged; `ans[fa[x]]` retains its other elements unchanged except for `ans[fa[x]][j]` which is now equal to `ans[x][j]`.**
