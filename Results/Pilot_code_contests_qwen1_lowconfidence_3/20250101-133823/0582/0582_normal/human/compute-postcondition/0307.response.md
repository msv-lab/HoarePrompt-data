Postcondition: **`x` is either the value of `fa[x]` or `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, depending on the condition. If `nowChild[x] == lenChild[x]`, then `x` is the value of `fa[x]`. If `x != 0`, `ans[fa[x]]` is updated by performing bitwise OR operations between `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` until `ans[x]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[x]` is updated to be `ans[fa[x]]`. For every pair `(i, j)` in `query[x]`, if `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is 0. If `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is `len(ans[x][dep + i])`. If `nowChild[x] != lenChild[x]`, then `x` is `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1, and `dep` is increased by 1.**
