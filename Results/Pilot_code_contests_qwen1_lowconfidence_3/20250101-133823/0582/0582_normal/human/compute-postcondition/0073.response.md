Postcondition: **`x` is an integer, `j` is an integer, and `ans` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers. If `j` is in the list `ans[x]` and `ans[x][j]` is equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then no change is made to `ans`. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then either (a) `ans[x][j]` is updated to `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is set to an empty dictionary, or (b) `ans[x][j]` is set to an empty list with a length of 0.**
