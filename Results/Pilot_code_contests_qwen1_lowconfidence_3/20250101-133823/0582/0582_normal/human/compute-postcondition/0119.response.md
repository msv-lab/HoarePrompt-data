Postcondition: **`x` is a list of tuples (not equal to -1), `query[x]` is defined and has at least two elements, `nowlistindex` is 2, `i` is the third element in the tuple at index 1 of the list `query[x]`, `j` is the fourth element in the tuple at index 1 of the list `query[x]`. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, `answer[j]` is equal to `len(ans[x][dep + i])`. If `dep + i` is in `ans[x]` and `answer[j]` is 0, `answer[j]` remains 0. If `dep + i` is in `ans[x]` and `answer[j]` is not 0, `answer[j]` is updated to `len(ans[x][dep + i])`.**
