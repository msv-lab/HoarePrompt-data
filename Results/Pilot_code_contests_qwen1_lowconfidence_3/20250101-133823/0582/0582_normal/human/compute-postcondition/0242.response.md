Postcondition: **`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` is a list with an even length; `ans[x]` is a non-empty list; for every pair `(i, j)` in `query[x]`, if `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is 0. If `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is `len(ans[x][dep + i])`. The length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`. If `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `answer[j]` is 0. Additionally, for the current value of `j`, either `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the result of performing a bitwise OR operation between `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]` (if `len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j])`), or `ans[fa[x]][j]` is replaced by `ans[x][j]` (if `len(ans[x][j]) >= len(ans[fa[x]][j]))`.**
