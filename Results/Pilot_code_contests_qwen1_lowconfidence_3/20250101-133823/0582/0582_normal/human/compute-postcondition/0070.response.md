`ans[x][j].clear()` clears the list associated with `ans[x][j]`. Since the initial state tells us that `ans[x][j]` is a list whose length is less than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, clearing `ans[x][j]` means it will become an empty list. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is an integer, `ans` is a dictionary where `x` is a key, and the list associated with `ans[x][j]` is now an empty list, the length of `ans[x][j]` is 0, the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` (which remains unchanged).**
