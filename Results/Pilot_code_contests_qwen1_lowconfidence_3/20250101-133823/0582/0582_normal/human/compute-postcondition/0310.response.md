Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `x`, where each tuple contains a name (string) and an integer representing the direct ancestor index (or 0 if no direct ancestor), and a list `dep` of pairs of integers. It processes the structure defined by `x` and `dep`, performing operations based on the relationships between the nodes represented in `x`. The function traverses the tree structure starting from the root, updating a dictionary `ans` that keeps track of the union of sets from each node's descendants. Specifically, for each node, it updates `ans` to reflect the union of sets from its descendants, ensuring that `ans` is consistent across the entire tree structure. After the traversal, the function clears the `ans` and `dep` dictionaries, leaving them in a clean state. The function handles edge cases where nodes have no direct ancestors or when the traversal reaches the root node. If a node has more descendants than its parent, it merges the sets from the descendants into the parent node. If a node has fewer descendants, it merges the sets from the parent node into its own `ans`. This process ensures that `ans` is correctly populated with the union of sets from all descendant nodes, and the final state of the program leaves `ans` and related structures in a consistent and cleared state.**
