Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` must be a list with even length; `ans[fa[x]]` must not be empty; `j` is incremented. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is updated to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, if the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged; otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to an empty list.***
