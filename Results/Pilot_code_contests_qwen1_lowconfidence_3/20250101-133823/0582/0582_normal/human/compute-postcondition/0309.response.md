The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `dep`. 

- `x` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a string (representing a name) and an integer representing the direct ancestor index (or 0 if no direct ancestor).
- `dep` is a list of length `m`, where each element is a pair of integers `(vi, ki)` such that `1 ≤ vi, ki ≤ n`.

The output depends on the specific logic implemented within the function, but based on the provided information, the function does not directly specify a return value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of tuples `x` and a list `dep` and process them according to some internal logic (which is not specified here).

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `x` where each tuple contains a string and an integer, and a list `dep` of pairs of integers.**
