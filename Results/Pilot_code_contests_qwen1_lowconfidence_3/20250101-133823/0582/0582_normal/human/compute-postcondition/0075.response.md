`ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The values of `x` and `j` remain unchanged, and `fa` is assumed to be defined and holds an integer value for `fa[x]`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `j` is an integer, and `ans` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers; `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`**
