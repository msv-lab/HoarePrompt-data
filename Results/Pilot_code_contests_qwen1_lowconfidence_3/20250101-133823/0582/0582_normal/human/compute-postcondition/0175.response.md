Postcondition: ***`ans[fa[x]]` is non-empty, and `j` is the first element of `ans[fa[x]]`. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If `j` is in `ans[x]`, then either `ans[x][j]` is updated to the union of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` becomes an empty list, or `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to the union of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]` equals `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
