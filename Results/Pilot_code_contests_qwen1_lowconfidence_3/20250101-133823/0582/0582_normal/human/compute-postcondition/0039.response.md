Postcondition: ***`ans[x]` must have at least one element, `answer[j]` is 0 if `dep + query[x][nowlistindex]` is not in `ans[x]`, otherwise `answer[j]` is the length of `ans[x][dep + query[x][nowlistindex]]` for all valid `j` values; `j` is either not in `ans[fa[x]]` or is in `ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated according to the conditions in the if and else parts. Specifically, if `len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[x][j]` is cleared and bitwise OR'd with `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated to `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is also updated to this result.***

This postcondition covers all possible outcomes of the if-else block, ensuring that the overall state of the program variables is accurately described.
