The provided code snippet is empty (`"""count ans"""`), which means no operations are being performed on the variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` must be a list with even length; for every pair `(i, j)` in `query[x]`, if `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is 0. If `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is `len(ans[x][dep + i])`.**
