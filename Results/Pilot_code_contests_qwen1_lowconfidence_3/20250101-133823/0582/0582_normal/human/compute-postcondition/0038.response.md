Postcondition: ***`ans[x][j]` is updated according to the conditions in the if and else parts. Specifically, if `len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[x][j]` is cleared and bitwise OR'd with `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated to `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is also updated to this result. In both cases, `answer[j]` is 0 if `dep + query[x][nowlistindex]` is not in `ans[x]`, and `answer[j]` is the length of `ans[x][dep + query[x][nowlistindex]]` if it is present. Furthermore, `j` remains in `ans[fa[x]]`.***
