Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` must be a list with an even length; `ans[x]` is a non-empty list; for every pair `(i, j)` in `query[x]`, if `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is 0. If `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is `len(ans[x][dep + i])`. The length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`. If `len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`; otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is replaced by `ans[x][j]`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.***
