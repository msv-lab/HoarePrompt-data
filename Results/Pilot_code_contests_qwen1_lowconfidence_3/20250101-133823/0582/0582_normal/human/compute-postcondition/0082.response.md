Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer, `j` is an integer, and `ans` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, `ans[x][j]` is set to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, if the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged and `ans[fa[x]][j]` becomes an empty list. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to the union of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is set to `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
