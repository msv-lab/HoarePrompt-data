The code assigns the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` to `ans[x][j]`. This means that `ans[x][j]` will now hold the same list of integers as `ans[fa[x]][j]`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `ans` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the result of `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`; `ans[x][j]` is now equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`.**
