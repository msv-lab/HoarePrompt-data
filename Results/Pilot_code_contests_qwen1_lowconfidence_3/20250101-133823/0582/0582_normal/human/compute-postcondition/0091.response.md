Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer, `j` is the next integer in the list `ans[fa[x]]`. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is set to be equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If `j` is in `ans[x]` and the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to be the union of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged and `ans[x][j]` is set to be equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`.****
