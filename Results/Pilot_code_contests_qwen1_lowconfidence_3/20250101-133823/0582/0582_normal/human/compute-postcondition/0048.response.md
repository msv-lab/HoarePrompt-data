Postcondition: ***`ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` are updated according to the if and else conditions. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `answer[j]` remains 0 if `dep + query[x][nowlistindex]` is not in `ans[x]`, otherwise `answer[j]` is the length of `ans[x][dep + query[x][nowlistindex]]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared to an empty list. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated to be the bitwise OR of its current value and `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is set to `ans[x][j]`, `answer[j]` is 0 if `dep + query[x][nowlistindex]` is not in `ans[x]`, otherwise `answer[j]` is the length of `ans[x][dep + query[x][nowlistindex]]`, and `j` is now the next element in `ans[x]`. `fa[x]` is the parent node of `x`.***
