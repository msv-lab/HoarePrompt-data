The code assigns `x` the value of `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`. Here, `Child` is a list of lists, and `nowChild[x]` is an index into the sublist corresponding to `x`. The value of `x` is updated to the element at the index specified by `nowChild[x]` in the sublist of `Child` that corresponds to `x`.

Given that `x` was initially a list of tuples and `nowChild[x]` is a specific index, `x` will now hold a new value which is a tuple. The states of `Child`, `dep`, and `nowChild` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple, `Child` is a list of lists, `dep` is a list of length `m`, `nowChild` remains unchanged**
