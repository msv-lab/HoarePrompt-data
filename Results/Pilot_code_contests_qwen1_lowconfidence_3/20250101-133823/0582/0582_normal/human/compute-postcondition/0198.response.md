Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of tuples (not equal to -1). If `x != 0`, `query[x]` is defined, `nowlistindex` is the final index of the last iteration, and `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` maintain a consistent relationship as specified. Specifically, for every key `j` in `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]`:
- If `len(ans[x]) < len(ans[fa[x]])`, `ans[x]` is an empty dictionary where each key `j` maps to an empty set. For every key `j` in `ans[x]`, either `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` are equal, or `ans[x][j]` is a superset of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to be equal to `ans[x][j]`.
- If `len(ans[x]) >= len(ans[fa[x]])`, `ans[fa[x]]` is equal to `ans[x]`, and for each `j` in `ans[fa[x]]` before clearing, if `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and if `j` is in `ans[x]`, then either `ans[x][j]` is updated to the union of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` becomes an empty list, or `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to the union of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]` equals `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
