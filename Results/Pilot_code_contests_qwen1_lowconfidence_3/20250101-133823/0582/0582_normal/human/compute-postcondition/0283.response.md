The code `ans[x][j].clear()` clears the list at the position `ans[x][j]`. This means that the list stored at this position is now empty. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` must be a list with even length; `ans[fa[x]]` must not be empty; `j` must be the next index in `ans[fa[x]]`; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list.**
