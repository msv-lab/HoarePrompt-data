Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer, `j` is the next integer in the list `ans[fa[x]]`, and `ans` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to be the union of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is not greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged and `ans[x][j]` is set to be equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
