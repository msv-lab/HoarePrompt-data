Postcondition: **`x` and `j` are integers, `fa[x]` is the parent node of `x`. If `len(ans[x]) < len(ans[fa[x]])`, then `ans[x]` is cleared, `ans[fa[x]]` remains unchanged, `answer[j]` retains its value as per the conditions specified in the loop. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]]` holds the contents of `ans[x]`, and `ans[x]` remains unchanged.**
