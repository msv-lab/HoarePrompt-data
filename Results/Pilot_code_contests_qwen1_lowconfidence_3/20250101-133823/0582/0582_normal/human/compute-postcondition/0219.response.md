The code sets `answer[j]` to 0. This means that the value of `answer[j]` is now 0. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is equal to `query[x][nowlistindex]`; `j` is equal to `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`; `answer[j]` is 0**
