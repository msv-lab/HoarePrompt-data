Postcondition: **`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` must be a list with even length; `ans[fa[x]]` must not be empty; `j` is incremented. If `len(ans[x][j]) > len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared and `ans[x][j]` is the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is now equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`.**
