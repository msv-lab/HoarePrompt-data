`ans[x][j]` is updated to include the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The `|=` operator performs a bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` must be a list with even length; `ans[fa[x]]` must not be empty; `j` is incremented, and for the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`; `ans[x][j]` is the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`.**
