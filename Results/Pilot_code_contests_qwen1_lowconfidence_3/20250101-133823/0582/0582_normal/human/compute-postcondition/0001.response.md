Postcondition: **`x` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name (string) and an integer representing the direct ancestor index (or 0 if no direct ancestor). `dep` is a list of length `m`, where each element is a pair of integers (vi, ki) such that 1 ≤ vi, ki ≤ n. The current value of `nowChild[x]` is equal to the current value of `lenChild[x]`.**
