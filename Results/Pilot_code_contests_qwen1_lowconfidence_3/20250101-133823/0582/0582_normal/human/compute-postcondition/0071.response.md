The code `ans[x][j] = ans[fa[x]][j]` assigns the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` to `ans[x][j]`. The length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged, and since `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list, `ans[x][j]` will also become an empty list. All other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`j` is an integer, `ans` is a dictionary where `x` is a key, the list associated with `ans[x][j]` is now an empty list, the length of `ans[x][j]` is 0, the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` (which remains an empty list).**
