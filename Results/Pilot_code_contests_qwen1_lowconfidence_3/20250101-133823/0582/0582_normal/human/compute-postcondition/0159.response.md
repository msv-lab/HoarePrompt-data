Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of tuples (not equal to -1), `query[x]` is defined and has at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop will execute, `nowlistindex` is now `nowlistindex + 1`, and `ans[x]` is non-empty. If `ans[fa[x]][j]` is equal to `ans[x][j]`, then this relationship remains unchanged. Otherwise, if the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to the union of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is cleared. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is not less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged and `ans[x][j]` is cleared if it was not already empty.***
