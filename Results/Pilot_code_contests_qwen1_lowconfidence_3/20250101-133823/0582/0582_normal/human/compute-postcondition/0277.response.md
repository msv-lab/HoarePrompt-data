Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` must be a list with even length; `ans[fa[x]]` must not be empty. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, `ans[x][j]` will be updated to be equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` will either remain the same or increase due to the bitwise OR with `ans[x][j]`. If `len(ans[x][j]) > len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[x][j]` is the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is set to an empty list. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` becomes equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated by performing a bitwise OR with `ans[x][j]`. If `j` is already in `ans[x]`, `ans[x][j]` will be updated to be the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`, and the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` will either remain the same or increase due to the bitwise OR with `ans[x][j]`.***
