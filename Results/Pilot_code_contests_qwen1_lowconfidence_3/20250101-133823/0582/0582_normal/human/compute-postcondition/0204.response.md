`dep` is incremented by 1, while the value of `x` remains unchanged since no assignment operation is performed on `x`. The other variables (`nowChild[x]` and `lenChild[x]`) also remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple (from Child[x][nowChild[x]]), `x` is not equal to -1, nowChild[x] is not equal to lenChild[x], dep is increased by 1**
