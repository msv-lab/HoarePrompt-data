Postcondition: **`x` is a list of tuples. If `nowChild[x]` equals `lenChild[x]`, then `x` is set to `fa[x]`, `nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1, and `dep` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `x` remains a tuple, `nowChild` remains unchanged, `Child` is a list of lists, and `dep` is a list of length `m+1`.**
