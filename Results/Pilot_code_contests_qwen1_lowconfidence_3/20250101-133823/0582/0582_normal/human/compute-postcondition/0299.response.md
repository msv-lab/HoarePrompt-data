Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` is a list with even length; `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` are lists. If `len(ans[x]) < len(ans[fa[x]])`, then `ans[fa[x]]` is updated by performing bitwise OR operations between `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` until `ans[x]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[x]` is updated to be `ans[fa[x]]`. For every pair `(i, j)` in `query[x]`, if `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is 0. If `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is `len(ans[x][dep + i])`.***
