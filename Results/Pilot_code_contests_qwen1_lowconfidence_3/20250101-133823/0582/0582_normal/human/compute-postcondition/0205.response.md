Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, depending on the condition. If `nowChild[x] == lenChild[x]`, then `x` is now the value of `fa[x]`, `fa[x]` is unchanged, `query[x]` is defined, `nowlistindex` is unchanged, `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` maintain the specified relationship, `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1, and `dep` is decreased by 1. If `nowChild[x] != lenChild[x]`, then `x` is a tuple from `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `x` is not equal to -1, `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`, and `dep` is increased by 1.***
