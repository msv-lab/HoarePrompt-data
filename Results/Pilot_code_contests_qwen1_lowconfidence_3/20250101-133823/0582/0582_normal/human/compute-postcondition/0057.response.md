Postcondition: ***`ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` retain their structure and elements unchanged except for `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is set to `ans[x][j]`. If `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]` and `len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is set to `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`. `ans[x]` and `fa[x]` retain their original values.***
