The code `ans[fa[x]][j] |= ans[x][j]` performs a bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and assigns the result back to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the result of `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`.
2. The values of `x`, `j`, `fa`, and `ans` remain unchanged except for the modification in `ans[fa[x]][j]`.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is an integer.
- `j` is the next integer in the list `ans[fa[x]]`.
- `ans` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers.

After executing the code, the only change is to the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `j` is the next integer in the list `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`.**
