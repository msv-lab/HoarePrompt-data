`ans[x][j].clear()` clears the list at index `j` of `ans[x]`. This means that the list at `ans[x][j]` is now empty. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` is a list with even length; `ans[fa[x]]` is not empty; `j` is incremented, and for the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`; `ans[x][j]` is an empty list.**
