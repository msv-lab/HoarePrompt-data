Output State: **`ans[x]` must have at least one element, `answer[j]` is 0 if `dep + query[x][nowlistindex]` is not in `ans[x]`, otherwise `answer[j]` is the length of `ans[x][dep + query[x][nowlistindex]]` for all valid `j` values; `j` is now the next element in `ans[x]`; `ans[x][j]` is updated to be the bitwise OR of its current value and `ans[fa[x]][j]`; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared (set to an empty set).**
