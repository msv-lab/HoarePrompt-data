Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of tuples (not equal to -1), `query[x]` is defined and has at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop will execute, `nowlistindex` is the index of the last iteration, `ans[x]` is non-empty. If `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]` and has the same value as `ans[x][j]`, no changes are made. Otherwise, if `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, the length of `ans[x][j]` is updated to match the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to be equal to `ans[x][j]` if the lengths are equal or `ans[x][j]` is longer.***
