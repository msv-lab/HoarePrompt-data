Postcondition: **`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is equal to `query[x][nowlistindex]`; `j` is equal to `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]` (and updated to `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`); `nowlistindex` is now `nowlistindex + 1` and must be less than `len(query[x])`; if `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is `0`; otherwise, `answer[j]` is assigned the value of `len(ans[x][dep + i])`.**
