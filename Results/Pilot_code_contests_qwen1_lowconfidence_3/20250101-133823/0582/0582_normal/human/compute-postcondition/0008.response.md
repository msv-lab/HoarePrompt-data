`answer[j]` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states, and the condition about `dep + i` not being in `ans[x]` also remains true.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `query[x][nowlistindex]`, `j` is equal to `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`, the value of `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`; `answer[j]` is 0**
