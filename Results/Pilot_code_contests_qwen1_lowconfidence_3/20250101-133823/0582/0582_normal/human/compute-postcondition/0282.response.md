`ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to include the bitwise OR of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`. The value of `fa[x]`, `x`, `query[x]`, and `j` remain unchanged, but `ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[x]` are modified.

Output State: **`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` must be a list with even length; `ans[fa[x]]` must not be empty; `j` must be the next index in `ans[fa[x]]`; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the bitwise OR of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`.**
