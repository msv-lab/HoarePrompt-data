The code `dep -= 1` decrements the value of `dep` by 1. No other variables are directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is to the value of `dep`.

Output State: **`x` is now the value of `fa[x]`, `query[x]` is a list with even length, `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` are lists, if `x != 0`, `ans[fa[x]]` is updated by performing bitwise OR operations between `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` until `ans[x]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[x]` is updated to be `ans[fa[x]]`, for every pair `(i, j)` in `query[x]`, if `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is 0. If `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is `len(ans[x][dep + i])`; `nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1; `dep` is decreased by 1.**
