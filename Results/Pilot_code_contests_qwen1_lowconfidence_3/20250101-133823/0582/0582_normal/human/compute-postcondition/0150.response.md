Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of tuples (not equal to -1), `query[x]` is defined and has at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop will execute, `nowlistindex` is the index of the last iteration plus 1, and `ans[x]` is non-empty. If `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`:
- If `j` has the same value as `ans[x][j]`, no changes are made.
- If `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to `ans[x][j]` if the lengths are equal or `ans[x][j]` is longer.
- If `len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, no changes are made.
Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to be equal to `ans[x][j]`.***
