Output State: **`ans[fa[x]]` has its `j`-th element updated to include all elements of `ans[x]`'s `j`-th element using bitwise OR operation; `answer[j]` remains 0 if `dep + query[x][nowlistindex]` is not in `ans[x]`, otherwise `answer[j]` is the length of `ans[x][dep + query[x][nowlistindex]]`; `j` is now the next element in `ans[x]`.**
