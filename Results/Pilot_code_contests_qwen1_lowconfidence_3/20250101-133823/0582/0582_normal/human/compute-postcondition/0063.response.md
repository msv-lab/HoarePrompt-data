`ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The value of `j` is not in the list `ans[x]` before the execution of the code, and `fa[x]` is assumed to be a key in the dictionary `ans` because otherwise, accessing `ans[fa[x]]` would raise a KeyError. The value of `j` is appended to `ans[x]` as the new value for `ans[x][j]`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `ans` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers; `j` is in the list `ans[x]` and `ans[x][j]` is equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`.**
