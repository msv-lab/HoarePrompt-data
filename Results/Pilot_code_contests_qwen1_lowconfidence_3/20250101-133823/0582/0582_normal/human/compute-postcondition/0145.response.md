`ans[x][j].clear()` clears the contents of the list `ans[x][j]`. This means that the list `ans[x][j]` will no longer contain any elements. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`x` is a list of tuples (not equal to -1), `query[x]` is defined and has at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop will execute, `nowlistindex` is the index of the last iteration plus 1, `ans[x]` is non-empty, `ans[x][j]` is an empty list.**
