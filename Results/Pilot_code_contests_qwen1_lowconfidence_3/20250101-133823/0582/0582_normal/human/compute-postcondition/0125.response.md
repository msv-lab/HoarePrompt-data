Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of tuples (not equal to -1), `query[x]` is defined and has at least two elements, `nowlistindex` is 4, `i` is the fifth element in the tuple at index 1 of the list `query[x]`, `j` is now equal to `i`. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, `answer[j]` is equal to `len(ans[x][dep + i])`. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is 0.***
