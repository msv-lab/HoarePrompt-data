Postcondition: **`ans[fa[x]]` is non-empty, and `j` is the third element of `ans[fa[x]]`. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `len(ans[x][j]) > len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` becomes an empty list, and `ans[x][j]` is the union of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`. In all other cases, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to the union of `current_value` and `value_x_j`, and `ans[x][j]` is also the union of `current_value` and `value_x_j`.**
