The code `ans[fa[x]][j] = ans[x][j]` assigns the value of `ans[x][j]` to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. This means that the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to be the same as `ans[x][j]`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` must be a list with an even length; `ans[x]` must be a non-empty list; for every pair `(i, j)` in `query[x]`, if `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is 0. If `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is `len(ans[x][dep + i])`. The length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`. The current value of `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]`.**
