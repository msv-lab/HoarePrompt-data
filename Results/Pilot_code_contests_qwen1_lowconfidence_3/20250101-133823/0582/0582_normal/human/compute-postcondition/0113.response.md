Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of tuples (not equal to -1), `query[x]` is defined and has at least one element, `nowlistindex` is 0, `i` is the first element in the tuple at index 0 of the list `query[x]`, `j` is the second element in the tuple at index 0 of the list `query[x]`. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, `answer[j]` is set to 0. If `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, `answer[j]` is set to the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`***
