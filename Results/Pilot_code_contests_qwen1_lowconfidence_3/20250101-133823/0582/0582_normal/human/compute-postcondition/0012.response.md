To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is equal to `query[x][nowlistindex]`.
   - `j` is equal to `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`.
   - The condition to check is if `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is set to 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `nowlistindex` from 0 to `len(query[x]) - 2` (since `nowlistindex + 1` should be within bounds).

3. **State After Previous Iteration:**
   - Assume we have just finished an iteration where `nowlistindex` was some value `k`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `nowlistindex` will be incremented by 1, so it becomes `k + 1`.

5. **Checking Conditions:**
   - `i` will be updated to `query[x][k + 1]`.
   - `j` will be updated to `query[x][k + 2]`.

6. **Ensuring Loop Continues:**
   - To ensure the loop continues, `nowlistindex` must be within the valid range, i.e., `0 <= k + 1 < len(query[x])`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` is updated to `query[x][k + 1]`.
- `j` is updated to `query[x][k + 2]`.
- `nowlistindex` is incremented to `k + 1`.

Therefore, the final state before the next iteration would be:

State: **`i` is equal to `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`, `j` is equal to `query[x][nowlistindex + 2]`, `nowlistindex` is equal to `nowlistindex + 1`**.
