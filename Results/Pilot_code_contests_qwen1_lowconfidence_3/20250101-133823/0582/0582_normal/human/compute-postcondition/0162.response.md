Postcondition: **`x` is a list of tuples (not equal to -1), `query[x]` is defined and has at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop executed, `nowlistindex` is the index of the last iteration, `i` is the corresponding element in the tuple at index `(nowlistindex // 2)` of the list `query[x]`, `j` is the corresponding element in the tuple at index `(nowlistindex // 2 + 1)` of the list `query[x]`, `len(ans[x])` is greater than or equal to `len(ans[fa[x]])`, `answer[j]` is either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` for each valid `j` based on the conditions checked in the loop.**
