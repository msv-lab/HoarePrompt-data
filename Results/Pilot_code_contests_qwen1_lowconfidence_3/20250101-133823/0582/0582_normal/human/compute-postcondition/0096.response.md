Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer, and `j` is an integer. If `x` is not 0, then either `ans[x]` is cleared and `ans[fa[x]]` remains unchanged, or `ans[fa[x]]` holds the contents of `ans[x]` and `ans[x]` remains unchanged. In both cases, `answer[j]` retains its value as per the conditions specified in the loop. If `x` is 0, no changes occur.***
