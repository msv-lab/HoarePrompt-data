`dep` is incremented by 1, changing its value from a list of length `m` to a list of length `m+1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a tuple, `Child` is a list of lists, `dep` is a list of length `m+1`, `nowChild` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple, `Child` is a list of lists, `dep` is a list of length `m+1`, `nowChild` remains unchanged**
