`ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, meaning all elements in the list `ans[fa[x]][j]` are removed. The lengths and contents of other lists and variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` must be a list with even length; `ans[fa[x]]` must not be empty; `j` is in `ans[x]`; the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`; `ans[x][j]` is the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now an empty list.**
