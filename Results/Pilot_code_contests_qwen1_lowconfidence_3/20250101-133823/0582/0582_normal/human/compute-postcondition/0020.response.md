The initial state is:
- `i` is equal to `query[x][nowlistindex + 3]`
- `j` is equal to `query[x][nowlistindex + 4] + 1`
- `nowlistindex` is equal to `nowlistindex + 3`

The code snippet is:
```python
j = query[x][nowlistindex + 1]
```

Step-by-step analysis:
- The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- The value of `j` is updated to `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`.
- The value of `nowlistindex` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `i` is equal to `query[x][nowlistindex + 3]`
- `j` is equal to `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`
- `nowlistindex` is equal to `nowlistindex + 3`

Output State: **`i` is equal to `query[x][nowlistindex + 3]`; `j` is equal to `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`; `nowlistindex` is equal to `nowlistindex + 3`**
