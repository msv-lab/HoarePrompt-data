The code `ans[x].clear()` clears the list `ans[x]`. This means that all elements in `ans[x]` are removed. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` is a list with an even length; `ans[x]` is an empty list; `ans[fa[x]]` remains unchanged; `fa[x]` remains unchanged; `answer[j]` remains unchanged. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, for every `j` in `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the result of performing the bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` until `ans[x][j]` is cleared.**
