Postcondition: ***`ans[x]` must have at least one element, `answer[j]` is 0 if `dep + query[x][nowlistindex]` is not in `ans[x]`, otherwise `answer[j]` is the length of `ans[x][dep + query[x][nowlistindex]]` for all valid `j` values. Additionally, `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`. The current length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
