The code `j = query[x][nowlistindex + 1]` assigns the value of the element at the index `nowlistindex + 1` of the tuple at index 1 of the list `query[x]` to the variable `j`. Given the initial state:

- `x` is a list of tuples (not equal to -1)
- `query[x]` is defined and has at least two elements
- `nowlistindex` is 4
- `i` is the fifth element in the tuple at index 1 of the list `query[x]`
- `j` is the fourth element in the tuple at index 1 of the list `query[x]`

From the initial state, `nowlistindex + 1` equals 5. Therefore, `j` is assigned the value of the fifth element in the tuple at index 1 of the list `query[x]`, which is the same as the value of `i`.

Output State: **`x` is a list of tuples (not equal to -1), `query[x]` is defined and has at least two elements, `nowlistindex` is 4, `i` is the fifth element in the tuple at index 1 of the list `query[x]`, `j` is now equal to `i`**
