Output State: **`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` must be a list with an even length; `ans[x]` is a non-empty list; for every pair `(i, j)` in `query[x]`, if `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is 0. If `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is `len(ans[x][dep + i])`. The length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`. After executing `ans[x][j] |= ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[x][j]` is updated to the result of the bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` if `len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, otherwise `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.**

Note: The exact values of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` are not specified, so the specific value of `ans[x][j]` after the operation depends on the current values of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`.
