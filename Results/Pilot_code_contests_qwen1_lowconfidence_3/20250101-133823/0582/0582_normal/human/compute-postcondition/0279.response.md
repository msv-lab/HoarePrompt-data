The code assigns the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` to `ans[x][j]`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` must be a list with even length; `ans[fa[x]]` must not be empty; `j` must be the next index in `ans[fa[x]]`; `ans[x][j]` is equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`**
