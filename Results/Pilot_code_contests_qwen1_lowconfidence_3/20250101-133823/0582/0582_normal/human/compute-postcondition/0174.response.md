Postcondition: **`ans[fa[x]]` is non-empty, `j` is the first element of `ans[fa[x]]`, and `j` is in `ans[x]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is updated to `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` becomes an empty list. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` equals `ans[fa[x]][j]`.**
