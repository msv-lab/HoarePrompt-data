Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is equal to `query[x][nowlistindex]`; `j` is equal to `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`; if `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is 0. If `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is `len(ans[x][dep + i])`.***
