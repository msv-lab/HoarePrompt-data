The code `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` clears the list at the position `ans[fa[x]][j]`. This means that the list at that specific position is now empty.

- The precondition that `ans[fa[x]]` must not be empty is still valid.
- The value of `j` is the next index in `ans[fa[x]]`, which means `j` is incremented.
- The value of `fa[x]` and `x` remains unchanged.
- The value of `query[x]` and `ans[x]` remain unchanged as no operation directly affects them.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` must be a list with even length; `ans[fa[x]]` must not be empty; `j` is incremented; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` must be a list with even length; `ans[fa[x]]` must not be empty; `j` is incremented; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list.**
