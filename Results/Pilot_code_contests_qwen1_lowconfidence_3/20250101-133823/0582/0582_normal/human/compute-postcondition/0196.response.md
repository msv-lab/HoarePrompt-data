The code `ans[fa[x]] = ans[x]` assigns the value of `ans[x]` to `ans[fa[x]]`. This means that the contents of `ans[fa[x]]` will now be the same as `ans[x]`, effectively overwriting the previous contents of `ans[fa[x]]` with those of `ans[x]`.

Given the initial state:
- `ans[fa[x]]` is an empty list.
- For each `j` in `ans[fa[x]]` before clearing, if `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and if `j` is in `ans[x]`, then either `ans[x][j]` is updated to the union of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` becomes an empty list, or `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to the union of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]` equals `ans[fa[x]][j]`.

Since `ans[fa[x]]` is initially an empty list, after the assignment, it will also be an empty list because it is being set to `ans[x]`.

Therefore, the only change is that `ans[fa[x]]` is now equal to `ans[x]`.

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]]` is equal to `ans[x]`, and for each `j` in `ans[fa[x]]` before clearing, if `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and if `j` is in `ans[x]`, then either `ans[x][j]` is updated to the union of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` becomes an empty list, or `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to the union of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]` equals `ans[fa[x]][j]`.**
