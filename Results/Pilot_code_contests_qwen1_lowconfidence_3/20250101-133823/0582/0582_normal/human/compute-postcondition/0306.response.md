`dep` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `dep` is not specified. The other variables (`x`, `nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `x` must not be -1, `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`, and `dep` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`x` is `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `x` must not be -1, `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`, `dep` is increased by 1**
