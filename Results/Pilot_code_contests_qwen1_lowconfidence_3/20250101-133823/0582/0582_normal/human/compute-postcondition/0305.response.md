The code assigns `x` the value of `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`. Given the initial state where `x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, depending on the condition, and `x` must not be -1, and `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`, the value of `x` changes according to the new assignment.

- The original value of `x` (whether it was a list of tuples or `fa[x]`) is no longer relevant.
- `x` is now assigned the value `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:

Output State: **`x` is `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `x` must not be -1, and `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`**
