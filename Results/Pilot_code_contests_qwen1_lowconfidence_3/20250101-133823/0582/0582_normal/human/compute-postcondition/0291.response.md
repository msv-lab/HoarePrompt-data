The code `ans[fa[x]][j] |= ans[x][j]` updates the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` by performing a bitwise OR operation between `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

- `x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1.
- `query[x]` must be a list with even length.
- `ans[fa[x]]` must not be empty.
- `j` is incremented, and for the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.

After executing the line of code, the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated. Since the original value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is not specified, we denote it as `original_value`. The new value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` will be the result of `original_value | ans[x][j]`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is as follows:
- `x` remains a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1.
- `query[x]` remains a list with even length.
- `ans[fa[x]]` remains not empty.
- `j` is incremented, so `j` is now `j + 1`.
- `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to `original_value | ans[x][j]`.

Output State: **`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` is a list with even length; `ans[fa[x]]` is not empty; `j` is incremented, and for the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to `original_value | ans[x][j]`**.
