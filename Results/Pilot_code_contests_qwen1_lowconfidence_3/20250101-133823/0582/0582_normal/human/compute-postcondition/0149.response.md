Postcondition: **`x` is a list of tuples (not equal to -1), `query[x]` is defined and has at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop will execute, `nowlistindex` is the index of the last iteration plus 1, `ans[x]` is non-empty. If `len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, no changes are made. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to be equal to `ans[x][j]`.**
