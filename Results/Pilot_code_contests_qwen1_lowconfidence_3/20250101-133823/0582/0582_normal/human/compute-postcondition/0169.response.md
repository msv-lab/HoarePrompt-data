`ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared using the `clear()` method, which removes all elements from the list `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged according to the initial conditions.

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]]` is non-empty, `j` is the first element of `ans[fa[x]]`, `j` is in `ans[x]`, the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[x][j]` is the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list.**
