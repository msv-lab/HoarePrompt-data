`nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is: `x` is now the value of `fa[x]`, `fa[x]` is unchanged, `query[x]` is defined, `nowlistindex` is unchanged, `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` maintain the specified relationship, and `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`x` is now the value of `fa[x]`, `fa[x]` is unchanged, `query[x]` is defined, `nowlistindex` is unchanged, `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` maintain the specified relationship, `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1**
