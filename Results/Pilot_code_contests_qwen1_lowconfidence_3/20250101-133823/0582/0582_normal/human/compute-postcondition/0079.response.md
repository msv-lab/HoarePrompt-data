The code `ans[x][j].clear()` clears the list stored at `ans[x][j]`. The value of `ans[x][j]` is now an empty list. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `ans` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the result of `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`; `ans[x][j]` is an empty list.**
