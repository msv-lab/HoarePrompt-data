`ans[x][j].clear()` clears the set `ans[x][j]`. Since `ans[fa[x]][j]` is non-empty and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`, the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged because the operation `|` (union) does not depend on the current value of `ans[x][j]` once `ans[x][j]` is cleared. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]][j]` is non-empty, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`, `j` is the second element of `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[x][j]` is an empty set.**
