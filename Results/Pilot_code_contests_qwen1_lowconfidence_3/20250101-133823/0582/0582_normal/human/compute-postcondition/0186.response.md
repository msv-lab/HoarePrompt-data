`ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The value of `j` is the third element of `ans[fa[x]]`, so `ans[x][j]` now holds the same value as `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]]` is non-empty, and `j` is the third element of `ans[fa[x]]`; `ans[x][j]` is equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`**
