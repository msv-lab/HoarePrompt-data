`ans[fa[x]]` is assigned the value of `ans[x]`. Since `ans[x]` remains unchanged and `ans[fa[x]]` was initially an empty list, `ans[fa[x]]` now holds whatever `ans[x]` contains. The value of `j` is the last integer in the list `ans[fa[x]]`, which means `j` is the last element of the list that now holds the contents of `ans[x]`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `j` is the last integer in the list `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[fa[x]]` holds the contents of `ans[x]`, `ans[x]` remains unchanged.**
