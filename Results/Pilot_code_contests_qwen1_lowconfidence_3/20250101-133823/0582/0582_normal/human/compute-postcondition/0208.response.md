To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will start and how the loop variable `nowlistindex` interacts with the given conditions.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, depending on the condition.
   - `x` must not be -1.
   - `ans[x][dep]` is now equal to `{ss[x]}`.

2. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop `for nowlistindex in range(0, len(query[x]), 2)` will execute as long as `len(query[x])` is greater than or equal to 2 (since the range is from 0 to `len(query[x])-1` in steps of 2).

3. **Key Variables:**
   - `nowlistindex`: This variable iterates over the indices of `query[x]` in steps of 2. For the loop to start, `len(query[x])` must be at least 2.
   - `query[x]`: The length of this list must be at least 2 for the loop to start.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since the loop requires `len(query[x])` to be at least 2, we need to ensure that `query[x]` meets this requirement.
   - We don't need to adjust the value of `ans[x][dep]` since it is given and doesn't directly affect the loop's execution.
   - We also need to ensure that `x` is not -1, but this condition is already stated.

### Conclusion:
The necessary adjustments to ensure the loop can execute are:
- `query[x]` must have at least 2 elements.
- `x` must not be -1 (already stated).

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, depending on the condition, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` must have at least 2 elements**.
