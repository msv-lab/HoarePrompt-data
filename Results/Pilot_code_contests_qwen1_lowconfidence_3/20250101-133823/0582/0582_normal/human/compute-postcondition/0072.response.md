Postcondition: ***`j` is an integer, `ans` is a dictionary where `x` is a key. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is updated to `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty dictionary. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` becomes an empty list, and its length is 0.***
