The code `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` clears the list stored at `ans[fa[x]][j]`. This operation removes all elements from the list, making it an empty list. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `j` is the next integer in the list `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list.**
