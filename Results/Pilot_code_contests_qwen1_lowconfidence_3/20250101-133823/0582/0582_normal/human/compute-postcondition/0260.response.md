Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` must be a list with an even length; `ans[x]` is a non-empty list with one fewer element; `ans[fa[x]]` remains unchanged; `fa[x]` remains unchanged; `answer[j]` remains unchanged. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to be the result of `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated to the result of the bitwise OR operation between its `j`-th element and the `j`-th element of `ans[fa[x]]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to the result of the bitwise OR operation between the `j`-th element of `ans[x]` and the `j`-th element of `ans[fa[x]]`.***
