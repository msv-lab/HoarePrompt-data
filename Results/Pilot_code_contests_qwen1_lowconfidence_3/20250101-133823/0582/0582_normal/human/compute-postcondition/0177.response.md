`ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Since `j` is the second element of `ans[fa[x]]`, the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is taken and assigned to `ans[x][j]`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]]` is non-empty, and `j` is the second element of `ans[fa[x]]`; `ans[x][j]` is equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`**
