Postcondition: ***`ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` retain their structure and elements unchanged except for `ans[fa[x]][j]`, which becomes equal to `ans[x][j]` if `len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j])`. If the condition is false, `ans[x][j]` is updated to `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is set to `ans[x][j]`.***
