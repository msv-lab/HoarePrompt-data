The code `x = Child[x][nowChild[x]]` updates the value of `x` to be the element in the list `Child[x]` at the index specified by `nowChild[x]`. Given the initial conditions, the value of `x` is no longer a list of tuples, but rather a single tuple from the original list at the specified index.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is a tuple (from Child[x][nowChild[x]]), `x` is not equal to -1, and nowChild[x] is not equal to lenChild[x]**
