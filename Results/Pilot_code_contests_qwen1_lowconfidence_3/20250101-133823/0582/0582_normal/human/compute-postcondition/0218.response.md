`j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a list of tuples or the value of `fa[x]`, and `x` must not be -1; `query[x]` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is equal to `query[x][nowlistindex]`; `j` is equal to `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`.
