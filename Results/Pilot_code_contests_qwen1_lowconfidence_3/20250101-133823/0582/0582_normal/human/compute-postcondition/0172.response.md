`ans[x][j].clear()` clears the list `ans[x][j]`. This operation does not affect the values of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[fa[x]]`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the fact that `ans[x][j]` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]][j]` is the result of `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`; `ans[fa[x]]` is non-empty; `j` is the first element of `ans[fa[x]]`; `j` is in `ans[x]`; the length of `ans[x][j]` is an empty list.**
