The code `ans[fa[x]][j] = ans[x][j]` updates the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` to be the same as `ans[x][j]`. Since `ans[x]` must contain at least one element, it implies that `ans[x][j]` exists and holds some value. After executing this line of code, the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` will be set to the same value as `ans[x][j]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]`, `ans[x]` contains at least one element, and `fa[x]` and `j` retain their original values.**
