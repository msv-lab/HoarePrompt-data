Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly handle the counting of distinct names among the k-sons for each query. Here are some issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Queries**: The queries are stored in `query[x]`, but the code does not correctly process these queries during the traversal. The logic for updating `ans` and `answer` based on the queries is flawed.

2. **Union-Find Logic Misunderstood**: The code attempts to merge sets from descendants into the parent node, but it does not correctly handle the k-son queries. For example, the code does not maintain a count of distinct names for each k-son level.

3. **Missing Key Logic**: The code does not correctly calculate the number of distinct names among the k-sons for each query. The `ans` dictionary is used to store sets, but the code does not properly count and update these sets based on the k-son levels.

Here is a simplified example where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
6
pasha 0
gerald 1
gerald 1
valera 2
igor 3
olesya 1
5
1 1
1 2
1 3
3 1
6 1
```

For the query `1 1`, the program should return `2` because `pasha` has two distinct names among his 1-sons (`gerald` and `olesya`). However, the provided code will not correctly compute this value due to the misalignment in how it handles the queries and updates the `ans` dictionary.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly implement the required functionality for every potential case, hence the program is **incorrect**.
