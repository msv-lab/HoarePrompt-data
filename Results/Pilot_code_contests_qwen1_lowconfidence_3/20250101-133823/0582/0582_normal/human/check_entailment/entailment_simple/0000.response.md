Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input and Building the Tree:**
   - The program reads the number of people (`n`) and constructs a tree using the input. Each person's name and direct ancestor are stored appropriately.
   - It also keeps track of the names using a hash table (`hash_string`), ensuring that each name is uniquely identified.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - The program processes `m` queries, storing them in the `query` array.
   - For each query, it tracks the indices to update the answer array (`answer`).

3. **Depth-First Search (DFS) Traversal:**
   - The `func_1` function performs a DFS traversal starting from the root node (node 0).
   - During the traversal, it collects the distinct names of all `k`-sons for each queried `(vi, ki)` pair.
   - It updates the `ans` dictionary to store these names efficiently, considering the hierarchy of ancestors.

4. **Updating Answers:**
   - As the DFS progresses, the program updates the `answer` array based on the collected names of `k`-sons.
   - The logic ensures that names are only counted once per distinct name across different `k`-son levels.

5. **Correct Handling of Queries:**
   - The program correctly handles each query and ensures that the answers are stored in the appropriate positions in the `answer` array.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the input to build the family tree structure.
   - Names are hashed to unique identifiers, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval.

2. **Query Storage:**
   - Queries are stored in the `query` array, allowing efficient access during DFS traversal.

3. **DFS Traversal:**
   - The DFS function (`func_1`) correctly traverses the tree, collecting the required information.
   - The `ans` dictionary is used to store the distinct names of `k`-sons for each node.

4. **Answer Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of distinct names for each queried `(vi, ki)` pair correctly.
   - The results are stored in the `answer` array as expected.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It builds the family tree, processes the queries, and computes the required results efficiently. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
