Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program adheres to the requirements:

1. **Data Structures Initialization:**
   - `child`: A list of sets representing the children of each node.
   - `query`: A list to store the indices of queries for each node.
   - `ans`: A dictionary to store the union of sets from each node's descendants.
   - `ss`: An array to map names to unique identifiers.
   - `fa`: An array to store the direct ancestor of each node.
   - `hash_string`: A dictionary to map names to unique identifiers.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the input to populate the `child` and `fa` arrays.
   - Names are mapped to unique identifiers using `hash_string`.

3. **Query Storage:**
   - Queries are stored in the `query` list, mapping each query to its corresponding node index.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function performs a depth-first traversal of the tree starting from the root.
   - It maintains the union of sets from each node's descendants in the `ans` dictionary.
   - For each node, it updates `ans` to include the union of sets from its descendants.
   - It handles merging of sets from parent nodes into child nodes and vice versa to ensure consistency.

5. **Processing Queries:**
   - After the traversal, the program processes the stored queries and prints the results.

### Why the Program is Correct:

1. **Correct Data Structures:**
   - The use of sets and dictionaries ensures efficient handling of unique names and their counts.

2. **Tree Traversal Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly traverses the tree and updates the `ans` dictionary to reflect the union of sets from each node's descendants.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - The program correctly stores and processes the queries, providing the required counts of distinct names among the descendants.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where a node has no direct ancestor or when the traversal reaches the root node.

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the program correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the program is correct.
