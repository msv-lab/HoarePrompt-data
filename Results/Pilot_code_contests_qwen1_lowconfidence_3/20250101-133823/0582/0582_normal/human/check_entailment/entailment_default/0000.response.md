Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the function `func_1` and its logic do not accurately calculate the number of distinct names among the k-sons of each specified person. Here are some key issues:

1. **Incorrect Initialization and Logic**: The initialization and logic for processing the family tree and calculating the number of distinct names among k-sons are not properly implemented. The `func_1` function does not correctly traverse the tree and compute the required values for `ans`.

2. **Missing Recursive Traversal**: The code does not use a recursive approach to traverse the tree and calculate the number of distinct names among the k-sons. Instead, it attempts to handle the traversal and calculation using loops and manual updates, which leads to incorrect results.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Ancestors and Descendants**: The code does not properly handle the calculation of k-sons and their distinct names. For instance, it does not correctly merge the sets of names from descendants into the parent nodes, which is crucial for determining the number of distinct names among the k-sons.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly implement the required functionality for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
