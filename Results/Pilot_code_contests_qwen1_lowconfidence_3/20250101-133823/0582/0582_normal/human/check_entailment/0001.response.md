Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where multiple ancestors have the same name but different descendants. Specifically, the program fails to account for the possibility that a k-ancestor could have the same name as another k-ancestor, leading to incorrect counts of distinct names among the k-sons.

For example, consider the following input:

```
6
valera 0
valera 1
valera 1
gerald 0
valera 4
kolya 4
7
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
4 1
5 1
6 1
```

The program will output:

```
1
0
0
0
2
0
0
```

However, the correct output should be:

```
1
0
0
0
1
0
0
```

In this case, `valera` (person 1) has two 2-sons (persons 3 and 5), both named `valera`. The program incorrectly counts these as two distinct names instead of one. This indicates that the program does not properly handle the uniqueness of names among k-sons.
