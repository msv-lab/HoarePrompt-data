Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the binary search logic for counting the number of distinct names among all names of the `ki-sons` of the man with number `vi`. There are several issues:

1. **Incorrect Ancestor Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate ancestors using a depth-first search (DFS) approach but does not correctly handle the calculation of `ki-sons`. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly traverse the tree to collect the names of `ki-sons`.

2. **Data Structure Misuse**: The program uses sets and dictionaries in an attempt to store intermediate results but does not utilize them effectively. For instance, the `ans` dictionary is intended to store sets of names but is not updated correctly during the traversal.

3. **Logic Errors**: The logic for updating the `ans` dictionary and the `nowChild` array is complex and error-prone. The conditions under which sets are added or merged are not clearly defined, leading to potential logical errors.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails, consider the following input:

```
6
pasha 0
gerald 1
gerald 1
valera 2
igor 3
olesya 1
5
1 1
1 2
1 3
3 1
6 1
```

For the query `1 1`, the program should output `2` because `pasha` has two distinct names (`pasha` and `gerald`) as 1-sons. However, due to the misimplementation of the DFS and set management, the program will not produce the correct result.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
