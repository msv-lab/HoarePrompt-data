Postcondition: ***`i` is `previous_i + 1`, `n` is an integer input from the user. If `l[1]` is not a key in `nbr`, then `nbr[l[1]]` becomes `[l[0]]`, `nbr[l[0]]` includes `l[1]`, and `cand` contains the value of `l[1]`. If `l[1]` is already a key in `nbr`, then `nbr[l[0]]` includes `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key, `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` if `l[0]` is already a key, `cand` does not include `l[1]` if `l[0]` is already a key, and `nbr[l[0]]` now includes `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key.***
