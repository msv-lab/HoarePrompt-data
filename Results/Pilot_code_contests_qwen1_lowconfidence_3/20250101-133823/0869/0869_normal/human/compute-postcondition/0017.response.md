`cand.remove(l[1])` removes the element `l[1]` from the list `cand`. Since the initial state does not specify what `cand` is, we assume it is a list that contains `l[1]`. After removing `l[1]` from `cand`, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr` is {`l[0]`: [l[1]], `l[1]`: [l[0]]}, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `l[1]` is no longer in `cand`**
