`i` is added to the set `marked`. The set `marked` now contains the element `i`, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `v` is a valid key in `nbr`, `nbr[v]` is not empty, `i` is not in `marked` anymore, `i` is in `marked`.

Output State: **`v` is a valid key in `nbr`, `nbr[v]` is not empty, `i` is in `marked`**
