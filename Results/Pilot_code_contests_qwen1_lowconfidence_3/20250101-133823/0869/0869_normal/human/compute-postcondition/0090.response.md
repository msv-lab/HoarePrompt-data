`Q.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `Q`. This operation does not affect the values of `v`, `nbr`, `nbr[v]`, `res`, `Q` (other than appending `i`), `i`, or `marked`. Therefore, the updated values are as follows:

- `nbr[v]` is not empty
- `i` is marked or added to `marked`
- `res` contains the value of `i` followed by `i`
- `Q` now includes `i` in addition to its previous contents
- `marked` contains `i`

Output State: **`v` is a valid key in `nbr`, `nbr[v]` is not empty, `i` is marked or added to `marked`, `res` contains the value of `i` followed by `i`, `Q` contains `i` in addition to its previous contents, `marked` contains `i`**
