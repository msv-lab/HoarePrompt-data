The code appends the value of `i` to the list `res`. Initially, `res` includes both `v` and `i`, so after appending `i` to `res`, `res` will now include `v` and `i` twice.

Output State: **`Q` is `[i]`, `marked` includes both `i` and whatever elements it had before, `res` includes `v`, `i`, and `i`**
