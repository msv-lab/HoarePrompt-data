`res` appends the value of `i`. The value of `i` is already marked or added to `marked`, and `res` contains the value of `i`. Therefore, after appending, `res` will contain the value of `i` again. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is a valid key in `nbr`, `nbr[v]` is not empty, `i` is marked or added to `marked`, `res` contains the value of `i` followed by `i`, `Q` contains `i` if `i` is not already in `marked`, `marked` contains `i`**
