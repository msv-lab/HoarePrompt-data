The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list `l`. This affects the values of the variables `l`, `i`, `n`, `nbr`, and `cand`. Let's analyze the changes:

1. `l` is updated to the split result of the input.
2. The value of `i` remains unchanged because the code does not modify `i`.
3. The value of `n` remains unchanged because the code does not modify `n`.
4. If `l[1]` was not already a key in `nbr`, `nbr[l[1]]` is updated to include `l[0]` and `cand` is updated to contain `l[1]`. If `l[1]` was already a key in `nbr`, `nbr[l[1]]` is updated to include `l[0]` and `cand` becomes an empty set.

Since the exact values of `nbr` and `cand` depend on the input, we cannot provide specific values for them. However, we can describe the changes clearly.

Output State: **`i` is `previous_i + 1`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` (if `l[1]` was not already a key), `cand` is updated to `{l[1]}` if `l[1]` was not a key, otherwise `cand` is an empty set.**
