The code initializes an empty dictionary `nbr`. The value of `n` is still the integer input from the user, representing the length of the list of tuples. No changes are made to `n` itself, but a new variable `nbr` is introduced.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from the user, representing the length of the list of tuples; `nbr` is an empty dictionary**
