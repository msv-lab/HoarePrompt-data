`cand.add(l[0])` adds the value of `l[0]` to the set `cand`. Since `l[0]` is a string, and it is added to `cand`, the set `cand` will now contain the elements that were previously there plus the new element `l[0]`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `n` is still the integer input from the user.
- `nbr` remains a dictionary where the key `l[0]` is associated with the value `[l[1]]`.
- `i` remains 0.
- `l` remains a list of strings obtained from the user input.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary where the key `l[0]` is associated with the value `[l[1]]`, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings obtained from the user input, and `cand` is a set containing the value `l[0]` if `l[1]` was not already a key in `nbr`, or the set `{l[0], l[1]}` otherwise.**
