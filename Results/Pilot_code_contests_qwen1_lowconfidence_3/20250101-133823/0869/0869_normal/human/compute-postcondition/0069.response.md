The code `marked.add(i)` adds the element `i` to the set `marked`. Since `marked` initially includes `i_next`, adding `i` will modify the set `marked`. The value of `Q` and `res` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`Q` is `[i, i_next]` or `[i_next]`, `marked` includes `i_next` and `i`, and `res` includes `v` and `i`**
