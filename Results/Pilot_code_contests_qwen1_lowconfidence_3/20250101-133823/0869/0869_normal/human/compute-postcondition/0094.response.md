`Q` is a non-empty list, meaning `len(Q) > 0`. The code `v = Q.pop()` removes the last element from `Q` and assigns it to `v`. After executing this line, `Q` will no longer contain that element, and `v` will hold its value.

Output State: **`Q` is non-empty except for the last element which has been removed; `v` is the last element of `Q` before it was removed.**
