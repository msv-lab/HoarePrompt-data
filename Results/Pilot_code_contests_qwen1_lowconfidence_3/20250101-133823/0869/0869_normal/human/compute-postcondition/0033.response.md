The code snippet `nbr[l[0]] = [l[1]]` assigns `l[1]` to the list at the key `l[0]` in the dictionary `nbr`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is `previous_i + 1`
- `n` is an integer input from the user
- `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` (if `l[1]` was not already a key)
- `cand` is updated to `{l[1]}` if `l[1]` was not a key, otherwise `cand` is an empty set

The code only updates `nbr[l[0]]` to `[l[1]]`, which means it creates a new entry in the dictionary `nbr` at key `l[0]` with the value `[l[1]]`.

Since no other variables are affected by this code, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`i` is `previous_i + 1`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`, `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` (if `l[1]` was not already a key), `cand` is updated to `{l[1]}` if `l[1]` was not a key, otherwise `cand` is an empty set.**
