Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary where the key is either `l[1]` or `l[0]`, the value is a list containing the other element from `l` with an additional element `l[1]` appended to it, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings obtained from the user input, `cand` is a set containing the value `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key in `nbr`, or an empty set otherwise, and `cand` is updated such that if `l[0]` was present, it is removed from `cand`.***
