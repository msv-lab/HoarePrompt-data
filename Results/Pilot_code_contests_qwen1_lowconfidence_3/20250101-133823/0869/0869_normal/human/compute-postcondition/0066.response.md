`Q` appends the value `i` to itself, so the list `Q` now contains `[i, i]`. The value of `marked` remains unchanged, including both `i` and whatever elements it had before. The value of `res` also remains unchanged, including `v`, `i`, and `i`.

Output State: **`Q` is `[i, i]`, `marked` includes both `i` and whatever elements it had before, `res` includes `v`, `i`, and `i`**
