To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the given conditions:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `v` in the set `cand`. Therefore, the loop can only execute if `cand` is non-empty.

2. **Dictionary `nbr`**: The problem mentions that for every pair of strings `(a, b)`, where `a` is a key in `nbr` and `b` is in `nbr[a]`, there is an entry in `nbr[b]` that is `a`. This means that the structure of `nbr` should support such pairs but does not directly affect the loop's execution condition.

3. **Set `cand`**: The set `cand` contains strings. According to the problem statement, `cand` must contain `b` if and only if `b` was added to `nbr` as a new key. This means that `cand` should contain at least one string for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the critical state adjustment needed is ensuring that `cand` is non-empty. 

### Step-by-step Reasoning:
- `n` (the integer input from the user) is irrelevant to the loop's execution condition.
- `nbr` (the dictionary) is irrelevant to the loop's execution condition since the loop simply iterates over elements in `cand`.
- `cand` must contain at least one string for the loop to execute.

### Final State Adjustment:
State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string and its value is a list of strings, `cand` is a set containing strings that must be non-empty**
