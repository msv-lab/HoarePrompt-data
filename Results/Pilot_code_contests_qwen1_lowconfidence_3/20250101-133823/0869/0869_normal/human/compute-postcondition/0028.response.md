The code `nbr[l[1]].append(l[0])` appends the value of `l[0]` to the list associated with the key `l[1]` in the dictionary `nbr`. This means the list corresponding to the key `l[1]` in the dictionary `nbr` will have its last element updated to include `l[0]`.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

- The initial state includes: `n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary where the key is either `l[1]` or `l[0]`, the value is a list containing the other element from `l` with an additional element `l[1]` appended to it, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings obtained from the user input, `cand` is a set containing the value `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key in `nbr`, or an empty set otherwise, and `cand` is updated such that if `l[0]` was present, it is removed from `cand`.
- The code `nbr[l[1]].append(l[0])` modifies the list in the dictionary `nbr` that corresponds to the key `l[1]` by appending `l[0]` to it.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the modification to the list in the dictionary `nbr`:

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr[l[1]]` is the list associated with key `l[1]` in `nbr` with `l[0]` appended to it, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings obtained from the user input, `cand` is a set containing the value `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key in `nbr`, or an empty set otherwise, and `cand` is updated such that if `l[0]` was present, it is removed from `cand`.**
