State: **`n` is the integer input from the user, representing the length of the list of tuples; `nbr` is an empty dictionary; `cand` is an empty set; `i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(n):` will start when `i` is less than `n`.
2. The initial value of `i` should be 0 because `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute at all.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is initialized to 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.
