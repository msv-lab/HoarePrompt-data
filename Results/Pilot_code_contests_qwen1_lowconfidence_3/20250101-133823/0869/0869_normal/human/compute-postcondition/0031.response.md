Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We need to understand the state at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `n` is an integer input from the user.
   - `nbr[l[1]]` is updated to include `l[0]` if `l[1]` was not already a key in `nbr`.
   - `cand` is updated accordingly.
     - If `l[1]` was not in `nbr`, `nbr[l[1]]` is set to `[l[0]]` and `cand` contains `l[1]`.
     - If `l[1]` was already a key in `nbr`, `nbr[l[1]]` is updated to include `l[0]` and `cand` becomes an empty set.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is controlled by the variable `i` and the value of `n`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` would have been incremented by 1.
   - `i` will now be `previous_i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given the above, we need to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time.

- Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, `i` will now be `previous_i + 1`.
- For the loop to continue, `previous_i + 1` must be less than `n`.

So, the new state should reflect these changes.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
- `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `nbr` and `cand` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless the loop body modifies them, but since the problem does not mention any modifications within the loop body, we assume they remain the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `previous_i + 1`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr[l[1]]` is updated to include `l[0]` if `l[1]` was not already a key in `nbr`, and `cand` is updated accordingly. If `l[1]` was not in `nbr`, `nbr[l[1]]` is set to `[l[0]]` and `cand` contains `l[1]`. If `l[1]` was already a key in `nbr`, `nbr[l[1]]` is updated to include `l[0]` and `cand` becomes an empty set.**
