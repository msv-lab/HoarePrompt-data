`v` is assigned the value of `Q.pop()`, which removes and returns the last item of `Q`. Since `len(Q)` must be greater than 0, `Q` has at least one element. After `pop` is called, the length of `Q` decreases by 1, and `v` is set to the value of the last element of `Q`.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q`, `Q` is `Q` with its last element removed, and `len(Q)` is len(`Q`) - 1.**
