The code `Q.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `Q`. 

- Initially, `Q` is either `[i, i_next]` or `[i_next]`.
- After appending `i` to `Q`, if `Q` was initially `[i, i_next]`, it becomes `[i, i_next, i]`. If `Q` was initially `[i_next]`, it becomes `[i_next, i]`.

Other variables such as `marked` and `res` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`Q` is either `[i, i_next, i]` or `[i_next, i]`, `marked` includes `i_next` and `i`, `res` includes `v`, `i`, and `i`.**
