`cand.add(l[1])` adds the value of `l[1]` to the set `cand`. The previous value of `nbr[l[1]]` is `[l[0]]`, `i` is `previous_i + 1`, and `n` is an integer input from the user. The state of `nbr`, `i`, and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nbr[l[1]]` is `[l[0]]`, `i` is `previous_i + 1`, `n` is an integer input from the user, and `cand` contains the value of `l[1]`.**
