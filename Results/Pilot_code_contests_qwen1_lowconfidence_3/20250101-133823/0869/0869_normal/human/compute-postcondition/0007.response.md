`cand` is an empty set and now it adds the first element of `l` to itself. Since `l[0]` is not already in `nbr`, adding it to `cand` changes its state. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary with `{l[0]: [l[1]]}`, `cand` is a set containing `l[0]`, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings obtained from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary with `{l[0]: [l[1]]}`, `cand` is a set containing `l[0]`, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
