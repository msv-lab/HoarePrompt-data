According to the given for loop, the loop iterates over each element `i` in `nbr[v]`. The loop body is omitted, but we need to consider how the states might change based on the loop's execution.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `v` is a valid key in `nbr`.
- `nbr[v]` is not empty.
- `i` is either in `marked` or not.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be an element of `nbr[v]` that has not yet been processed. Since the exact state changes within the loop body are not provided, we focus on the conditions under which the loop continues:

1. `nbr[v]` must still be non-empty, as the loop iterates through its elements.
2. `i` must be an element of `nbr[v]` that has not been processed before.

Given these conditions, for the loop to continue, the next `i` must be an element of `nbr[v]` that satisfies the condition (either in `marked` or not).

The state adjustments would then be:
- `v` remains a valid key in `nbr`.
- `nbr[v]` must still be non-empty.
- `i` must be an element of `nbr[v]` that has not been processed before.

Since `i` could be any element from `nbr[v]` that hasn't been processed, and there is no specific mention of `i` being added to `marked` or not, we assume it simply needs to be a valid next element in `nbr[v]`.

State: **`v` is a valid key in `nbr`, `nbr[v]` is not empty, `i` is an element of `nbr[v]` that has not been processed before**
