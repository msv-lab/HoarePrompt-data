`marked.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `marked`. Since `marked` originally contained the value of `i`, adding `i` again does not change its content. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`Q` is non-empty with an additional element `i`, `v` is the second last element of `Q`, `nbr[v]` must be non-empty, `marked` contains the value of `i`, and `res` contains `marked`.**
