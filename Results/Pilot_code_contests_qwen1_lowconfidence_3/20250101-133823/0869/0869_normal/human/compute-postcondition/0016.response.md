The code appends `l[0]` to the list `nbr[l[1]]`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer input from the user
- `nbr` is a dictionary where the key is the first element of `l` and the value is a list containing the second element of `l`. If the first element of `l` is not already in `nbr`, `nbr` is updated with `{l[0]: [l[1]]}` and `cand` is updated with `{l[0]}`. Otherwise, `cand` remains an empty set.
- `i` is 0
- `l` is a list of strings obtained from the input
- `l[1]` is in `nbr[l[0]]`

Let's step through the code:

1. The dictionary `nbr` contains the key `l[0]` and the value `[l[1]]`.
2. The code appends `l[0]` to the list `nbr[l[1]]`.

Given that `l[1]` is already in `nbr[l[0]]`, appending `l[0]` to `nbr[l[1]]` will add `l[0]` to the list associated with `l[1]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `n` is an integer input from the user
- `nbr` now contains `l[1]` as a key with a list `[l[0]]` (since `l[0]` was already in the list, it does not get added again)
- `i` is 0
- `l` is a list of strings obtained from the input
- `l[1]` is in `nbr[l[0]]`

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr` is {`l[0]`: [l[1]], `l[1]`: [l[0]]}, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `l[1]` is in `nbr[l[0]]`**
