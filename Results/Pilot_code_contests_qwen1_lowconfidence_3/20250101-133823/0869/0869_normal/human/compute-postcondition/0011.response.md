Postcondition: ***`n` is the integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary where the key is the first element of `l` and the value is a list containing the second element of `l`. If the first element of `l` is not already in `nbr`, `nbr` is updated with `{l[0]: [l[1]]}` and `cand` is updated with `{l[0]}`. Otherwise, `cand` remains an empty set. `i` is 0 and `l` is a list of strings obtained from the input.***
