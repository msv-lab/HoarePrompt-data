`marked.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `marked`. The value of `i` was previously an element of `nbr[v]` but is now added to the `marked` set. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is a valid key in `nbr`, `nbr[v]` is not empty, `i` is no longer an element of `nbr[v]` that has not been processed before; `i` is now in `marked`.**
