`res.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `res`. Before this operation, `res` is a list containing the string `v`. Since `i` is the first element in `nbr[v]` and is also in `marked`, appending `i` to `res` will modify `res` to contain both `v` and `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`Q` is an empty list, `n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string and its value is a list of strings that must contain at least one element, `cand` is a set containing strings that must be non-empty, `marked` is a set containing the strings `v` and `i`, `res` is a list containing the strings `v` and `i`, `v` is the string `v`, `i` is the first element in `nbr[v]` and is now in `marked`**
