The code appends the value of `i` to the list `res`. Given the initial state, `res` contains `marked`, which is the value of `i`, and now `i` is appended to `res`.

Output State: **`Q` is non-empty with an additional element `i`, `v` is the second last element of `Q`, `nbr[v]` must be non-empty, `marked` contains the value of `i`, and `res` is `[i, i]`**
