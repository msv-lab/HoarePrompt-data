According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cand`. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one element in `cand`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer input from the user.
- `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string and its value is a list of strings.
- `cand` is a set containing strings that must still be non-empty and have at least one more string.

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to ensure that `cand` still contains at least one string. Since `cand` is a set of strings and it must have at least one more string, at the start of the next iteration, `cand` must still contain at least one string.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `cand` still contains at least one string.

State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string and its value is a list of strings, `cand` is a set containing strings that must still be non-empty and have at least one more string**
