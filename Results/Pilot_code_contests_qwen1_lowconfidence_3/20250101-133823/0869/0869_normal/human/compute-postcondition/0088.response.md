`marked.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `marked`. Since `i` is already marked or added to `marked`, adding it again does not change its presence in the set. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `v` is a valid key in `nbr`, `nbr[v]` is not empty, `i` is marked or added to `marked`, `res` contains the value of `i`, `Q` contains `i` if `i` is not already in `marked`, and `marked` contains `i`.

Output State: **`v` is a valid key in `nbr`, `nbr[v]` is not empty, `i` is marked or added to `marked`, `res` contains the value of `i`, `Q` contains `i` if `i` is not already in `marked`, `marked` contains `i`**
