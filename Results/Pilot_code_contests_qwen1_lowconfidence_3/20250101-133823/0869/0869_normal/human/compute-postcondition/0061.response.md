The code `Q.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `Q`. From the initial state, we know that `Q` is an empty list, `n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary with keys as strings and values as lists of strings, `cand` is a set of non-empty strings, `marked` is a set containing the strings `v` and `i`, `res` is a list containing the strings `v` and `i`, and `i` is the first element in `nbr[v]` and is now in `marked`.

After executing `Q.append(i)`, the list `Q` will contain the value of `i` (since it was appended). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`Q` is `[i]`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string and its value is a list of strings that must contain at least one element, `cand` is a set containing strings that must be non-empty, `marked` is a set containing the strings `v` and `i`, `res` is a list containing the strings `v` and `i`, `v` is the string `v`, `i` is the first element in `nbr[v]` and is now in `marked`**
