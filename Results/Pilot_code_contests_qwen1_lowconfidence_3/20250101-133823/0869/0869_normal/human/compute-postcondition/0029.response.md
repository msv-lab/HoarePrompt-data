The code removes `l[1]` from the set `cand`. Given that `cand` was initially a set containing the value `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key in `nbr`, or an empty set otherwise, removing `l[1]` from `cand` will result in `cand` being an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr[l[1]]` is the list associated with key `l[1]` in `nbr` with `l[0]` appended to it, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings obtained from the user input, `cand` is an empty set, and `l[1]` was present in `cand`.**
