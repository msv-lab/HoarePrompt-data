The code snippet `print(' '.join(res))` does not change any of the variables. It simply joins the elements of the list `res` into a single string with spaces in between and prints it. The output of this print statement will be the contents of `res` formatted as a space-separated string. However, since no new values are assigned to any variables, the values of `Q`, `marked`, `res`, and `v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`Q` is empty, `marked` contains all nodes reachable from the initial node `v` without cycles, `res` contains all unique nodes reachable from `v` without cycles, `v` is the last node processed in `Q`. The output of the program is a space-separated string of the contents of `res`.**
