The code adds the value of `i` to the set `marked`. This means that `i` is now marked. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `marked` and the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`Q` is non-empty except for the last element which has been removed, `v` is the last element of `Q` before it was removed, `nbr[v]` must be non-empty, `marked` contains the value of `i`, and the current value of `i` is marked.**
