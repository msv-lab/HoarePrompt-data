`Q.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `Q`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated values are as follows:

- `v` is a valid key in `nbr`
- `nbr[v]` is not empty
- `i` is in `marked`
- `res` is `[i]`
- `Q` now contains the element `i`

Output State: **`v` is a valid key in `nbr`, `nbr[v]` is not empty, `i` is in `marked`, `res` is `[i]`, `Q` is `[i]`**
