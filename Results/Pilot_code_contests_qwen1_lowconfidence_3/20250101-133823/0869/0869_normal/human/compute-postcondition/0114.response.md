The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in the list contains two integers representing the indexes of cities connected by a stamp. The length of this list is `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, and each city index is an integer from 1 to \(10^9\). All city indexes are unique within each tuple, and the sequence of stamps corresponds to a valid route from one city to another without visiting any city more than once. 

Based on the given information, the function does not return a specific value but rather validates the input according to the constraints mentioned.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter which is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the indexes of cities connected by a stamp. It validates that the length of the list is between 1 and \(10^5\), each city index is an integer from 1 to \(10^9\), all city indexes within each tuple are unique, and the sequence of stamps forms a valid route without revisiting any city.**
