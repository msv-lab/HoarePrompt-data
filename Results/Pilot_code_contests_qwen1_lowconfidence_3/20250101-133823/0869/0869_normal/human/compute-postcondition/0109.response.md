`Q` appends the value `i` to itself, changing its content. The value of `v` remains the second last element of `Q`, and `nbr[v]` still has at least one more element. The value of `marked` remains unchanged, and the value of `res` depends on whether `i` was previously in `marked`. Since `i` is being appended to `Q`, it could now be in `marked`, but this needs to be checked. The initial condition that `res` is `[i, i]` if `i` was not previously in `marked` remains valid.

Output State: **`Q` is a non-empty list with an additional element `i`, `v` is the second last element of `Q`, `nbr[v]` must have at least one more element, `marked` contains the value of `i`, `res` is `[i, i]` if `i` was not previously in `marked`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged**
