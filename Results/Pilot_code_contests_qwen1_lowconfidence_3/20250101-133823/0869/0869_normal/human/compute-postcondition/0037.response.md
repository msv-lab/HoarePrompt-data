Postcondition: ***`i` is `previous_i + 1`, `n` is an integer input from the user. If `l[0]` is not already a key in `nbr`, then `nbr[l[0]]` becomes `[l[1]]`, `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]`, and `cand` is updated to `{l[1], l[0]}`. If `l[0]` is already a key in `nbr`, then `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` if `l[1]` was not already a key, `cand` does not include `l[0]`, and `nbr[l[0]]` now includes `l[1]`.***
