The code `v = Q.pop()` pops and assigns the last element of the list `Q` to the variable `v`. Initially, `Q` contains the element `v`, so after popping `v`, `Q` will be an empty list. The variable `v` will now hold the value `v`.

Output State: **`Q` is an empty list, `n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string and its value is a list of strings, `cand` is a set containing strings that must be non-empty, `marked` is a set containing the string `v`, `res` is a list containing the string `v`, `v` is the string `v`**
