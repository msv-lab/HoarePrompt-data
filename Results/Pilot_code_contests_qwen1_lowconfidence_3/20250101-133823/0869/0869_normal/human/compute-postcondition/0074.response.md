To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the current state of the program.

The loop condition is `len(Q) > 0`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as the length of the queue `Q` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has just executed, and we need to ensure that the loop can execute again in the next iteration. For the loop to continue executing, the length of the queue `Q` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, we need to ensure that the length of the queue `Q` is greater than 0.

State: **`len(Q)` must be greater than 0**
