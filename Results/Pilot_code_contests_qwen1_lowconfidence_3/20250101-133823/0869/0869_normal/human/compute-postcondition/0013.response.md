The code snippet updates the dictionary `nbr` by setting `nbr[l[1]]` to `[l[0]]`. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is the integer input from the user.
- `nbr` is a dictionary where the key is the first element of `l` and the value is a list containing the second element of `l`. If the first element of `l` is not already in `nbr`, `nbr` is updated with `{l[0]: [l[1]]}` and `cand` is updated with `{l[0]}`. Otherwise, `cand` remains an empty set.
- `i` is 0.
- `l` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
- The current value of `l[1]` is not in `nbr`.

Since `l[1]` is not currently in `nbr`, updating `nbr[l[1]] = [l[0]]` means that `nbr` will now have a new entry with `l[1]` as the key and `[l[0]]` as the value.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from the user, `nbr` is now a dictionary where the key is `l[1]` and the value is `[l[0]]`, `i` is 0 and `l` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
