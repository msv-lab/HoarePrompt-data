The code initializes an empty set named `cand`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `nbr`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from the user, representing the length of the list of tuples; `nbr` is an empty dictionary; `cand` is an empty set.**
