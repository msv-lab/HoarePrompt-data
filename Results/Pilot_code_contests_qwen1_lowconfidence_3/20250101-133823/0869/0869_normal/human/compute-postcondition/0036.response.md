The code removes `l[0]` from the set `cand`. Let's analyze the impact:

- `i` is defined as `previous_i + 1`, which means its value is dependent on the previous value of `i`.
- `n` is an integer input from the user, so its value remains unchanged.
- `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` if `l[1]` was not already a key, meaning `l[0]` is added to the list associated with `l[1]` in the dictionary `nbr`.
- `cand` is updated to `{l[1]}` if `l[1]` was not a key, otherwise `cand` is an empty set. This means if `l[1]` was a key before, `cand` is now an empty set. If `l[1]` was not a key, `cand` is now the set containing `l[1]`.
- `nbr[l[0]]` now includes `l[1]`, meaning `l[1]` is added to the list associated with `l[0]` in the dictionary `nbr`.

After executing `cand.remove(l[0])`:
- If `l[1]` was a key in `cand` before, `cand` would be an empty set, and removing `l[0]` from an empty set does not change anything, so `cand` remains an empty set.
- If `l[1]` was not a key in `cand` before, `cand` would be the set `{l[1]}`, and removing `l[0]` from this set (which is different from `l[1]`) also does not change the set, so `cand` remains the set `{l[1]}`.

Therefore, the value of `cand` after the operation depends on whether `l[1]` was a key before, but in both cases, the set `cand` does not include `l[0]` anymore.

Output State: **`i` is `previous_i + 1`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` if `l[1]` was not already a key, `cand` does not include `l[0]`, and `nbr[l[0]]` now includes `l[1]`.**
