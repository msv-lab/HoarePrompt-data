The code snippet `cand.add(l[1])` adds the element `l[1]` to the set `cand`. Since `cand` is initially a set containing the value `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key in `nbr`, or an empty set otherwise, adding `l[1]` again does not change its value because sets do not allow duplicate elements. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. The values of `n`, `nbr[l[1]]`, and `l` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr[l[1]]` is now `[l[0]]`, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings obtained from the user input, `cand` is a set containing the value `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key in `nbr`, or an empty set otherwise, and `cand` is updated such that `cand` contains `l[1]`.**
