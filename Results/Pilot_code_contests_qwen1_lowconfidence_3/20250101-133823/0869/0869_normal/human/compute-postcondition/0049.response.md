The code `break` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match-case statement. Since there is no such loop or match-case in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program will exit the current context where this `break` statement is placed. However, since the context is not provided, we assume the `break` statement is not within any loop or conditional structure in the broader program scope.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged:

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string and its value is a list of strings, `cand` is a set containing strings that must still be non-empty and have at least one more string**
