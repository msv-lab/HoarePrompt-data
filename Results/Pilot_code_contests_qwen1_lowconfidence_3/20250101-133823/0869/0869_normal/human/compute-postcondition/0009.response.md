`nbr[l[0]]` is accessed and the value `l[1]` is appended to the list associated with `l[0]` in the dictionary `nbr`. The value of `i` and `l` remains unchanged. The output state is: `n` is the integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary where the key is the first element of `l` and the value is a list containing `l[1]`, `cand` is an empty set, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
