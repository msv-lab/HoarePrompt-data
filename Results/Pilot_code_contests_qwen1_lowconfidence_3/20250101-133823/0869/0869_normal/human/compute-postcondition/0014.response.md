The code `cand.add(l[1])` adds the value of `l[1]` to the set `cand`. However, the initial state does not mention a set named `cand`. Therefore, we assume that `cand` is being initialized as a set before this line of code, or it is a pre-existing set.

From the initial state:
- `n` is the integer input from the user.
- `nbr` is a dictionary where the key is `l[1]` and the value is `[l[0]]`.
- `i` is 0.
- `l` is a list of strings obtained from the input.

After executing the line `cand.add(l[1])`, the value of `l[1]` is added to the set `cand`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary where the key is `l[1]` and the value is `[l[0]]`, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings obtained from the input, and `cand` is a set containing the value `l[1]`.**
