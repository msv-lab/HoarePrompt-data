The code snippet `res.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `res`. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `Q` is a non-empty list with an additional element from `nbr[v]`.
- `v` is the second last element of `Q`.
- `nbr[v]` must have at least one more element.
- `marked` contains the value of `i`.
- `res` remains as it was or changes to `[i, i]` if `i` was not previously in `marked`.

Since `res.append(i)` is executed, `i` is appended to `res`. If `i` was already in `marked`, `res` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `res` changes to `[i, i]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`Q` is a non-empty list with an additional element from `nbr[v]`, `v` is the second last element of `Q`, `nbr[v]` must have at least one more element, `marked` contains the value of `i`, `res` is `[i, i]` if `i` was not previously in `marked`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged**.
