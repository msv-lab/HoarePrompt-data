`res` is appended with the value of `i`. The value of `i` is now part of the list `res`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `v` is a valid key in `nbr`, `nbr[v]` is not empty, `i` is now in `marked`, `res` contains the value of `i`.

Output State: **`v` is a valid key in `nbr`, `nbr[v]` is not empty, `i` is now in `marked`, `res` contains the value of `i`**
