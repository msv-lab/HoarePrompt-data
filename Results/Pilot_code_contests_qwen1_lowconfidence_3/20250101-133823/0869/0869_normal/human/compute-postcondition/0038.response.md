The code `nbr[l[1]] = [l[0]]` updates the dictionary `nbr` such that the key `l[1]` points to a list containing only `l[0]`. Let's break down the changes:

1. **Check if `l[0]` is already a key in `nbr`:**
   - If `l[0]` is not already a key in `nbr`, then `nbr[l[0]]` becomes `[l[1]]` and `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]`, and `cand` is updated to `{l[1], l[0]}`.
   - If `l[0]` is already a key in `nbr`, then `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` if `l[1]` was not already a key, `cand` does not include `l[0]`, and `nbr[l[0]]` now includes `l[1]`.

Given that the code only assigns `nbr[l[1]] = [l[0]]`, let's consider both scenarios:

- If `l[0]` was not a key in `nbr` before, then after executing the line, `nbr[l[1]]` will be `[l[0]]`, and `nbr[l[0]]` will be initialized as `[l[1]]`. `cand` will be updated to `{l[1], l[0]}`.
- If `l[0]` was already a key in `nbr`, then `nbr[l[1]]` will be `[l[0]]` (if `l[1]` was not already a key), and `nbr[l[0]]` will include `l[1]`.

Since the code directly assigns `nbr[l[1]] = [l[0]]`, we know that `l[1]` is being added to the list of `nbr[l[0]]` (or initialized as `[l[0]]` if it doesn't exist). The other parts of the condition are not directly reflected in this single assignment.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `nbr[l[1]]` is set to `[l[0]]`.
- If `l[0]` was not a key in `nbr`, `nbr[l[0]]` is set to `[l[1]]` and `cand` is updated to `{l[1], l[0]}`.
- If `l[0]` was a key in `nbr`, `nbr[l[0]]` includes `l[1]`.

However, since the code does not explicitly state whether `l[0]` was already a key, we can only definitively say that `nbr[l[1]] = [l[0]]`.

Output State: **`nbr[l[1]]` is `[l[0]]`, `i` is `previous_i + 1`, `n` is an integer input from the user.**
