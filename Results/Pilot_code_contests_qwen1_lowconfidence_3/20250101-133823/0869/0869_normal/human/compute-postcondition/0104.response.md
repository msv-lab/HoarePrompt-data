`Q` appends the value of `i` to itself, which means `Q` now contains one more instance of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`Q` is non-empty with an additional element `i`, `v` is the second last element of `Q`, `nbr[v]` must be non-empty, `marked` contains the value of `i`, and `res` is `[i, i]`, and `Q` now includes an extra `i`.**
