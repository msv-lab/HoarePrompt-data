The code snippet `nbr[l[0]] = [l[1]]` updates the dictionary `nbr` by assigning the value `[l[1]]` to the key `l[0]`. Given the initial state, `l[0]` and `l[1]` are strings, and the dictionary `nbr` is initialized such that its keys are either `l[1]` or `l[0]` depending on whether `l[1]` was already a key.

After executing this line, the dictionary `nbr` will have the new entry with the key `l[0]` and value `[l[1]]`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary where the key `l[0]` is associated with the value `[l[1]]`, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings obtained from the user input, and `cand` is a set containing the value `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key in `nbr`, or an empty set otherwise.**
