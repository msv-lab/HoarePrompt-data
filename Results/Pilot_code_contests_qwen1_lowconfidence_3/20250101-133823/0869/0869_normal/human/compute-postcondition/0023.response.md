The code `nbr[l[0]].append(l[1])` appends the value `l[1]` to the list associated with the key `l[0]` in the dictionary `nbr`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer input from the user.
- `nbr` is a dictionary where the key is either `l[1]` or `l[0]` (depending on whether `l[1]` was already a key in `nbr`), the value is a list containing the other element from `l`.
- `i` is 0.
- `l` is a list of strings obtained from the user input.
- `cand` is a set containing the value `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key in `nbr`, or an empty set otherwise.

After executing the code:
- The value `l[1]` is appended to the list associated with the key `l[0]` in `nbr`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `l`, and `cand` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary where the key is either `l[1]` or `l[0]`, the value is a list containing the other element from `l` with an additional element `l[1]` appended to it, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings obtained from the user input, and `cand` is a set containing the value `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key in `nbr`, or an empty set otherwise.**
