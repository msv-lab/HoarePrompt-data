The code `marked.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `marked`. Before this operation, `i` is the first element in `nbr[v]` and is not in `marked`. After adding `i` to `marked`, `marked` will include `i`.

Output State: **`Q` is an empty list, `n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string and its value is a list of strings that must contain at least one element, `cand` is a set containing strings that must be non-empty, `marked` is a set containing the strings `v` and `i`, `res` is a list containing the string `v`, `v` is the string `v`, `i` is the first element in `nbr[v]` and is now in `marked`**
