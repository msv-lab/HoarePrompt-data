The code `marked.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `marked`. Since `marked` initially contained the value of `i`, adding `i` again does not change its contents. However, the operation confirms that `i` is now definitely in `marked`.

The other variables remain unchanged based on the given initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`Q` is non-empty with an additional element from `nbr[v]`, `v` is the second last element of `Q`, `nbr[v]` must have at least one more element, `marked` contains the value of `i`, and `res` remains as it was or changes to `[i, i]` if `i` was not previously in `marked`**
