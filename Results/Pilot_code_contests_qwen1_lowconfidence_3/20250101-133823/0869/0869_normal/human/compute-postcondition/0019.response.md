Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Current States:**
   - `n` is an integer input from the user.
   - `nbr` is a dictionary where the key is either `l[1]` or `l[0]` depending on whether `l[1]` was already a key in `nbr`, and the value is a list containing the other element from `l`.
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `l` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
   - `cand` is a set containing the value `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key in `nbr`, or an empty set otherwise.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

3. **Determine the State After One Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is initially 0, the loop will execute once if `i < n` is true.
   - After one iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - The condition for the loop to execute again is `i < n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is determined by the user input.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.
   - `nbr`, `l`, and `cand` remain unchanged based on the provided information.

Given this analysis, the updated states at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:

**State: `n` is the integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary where the key is either `l[1]` or `l[0]` (depending on whether `l[1]` was already a key in `nbr`), the value is a list containing the other element from `l`, `i` is 1, `l` is a list of strings obtained from the input, and `cand` is a set containing the value `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key in `nbr`, or an empty set otherwise.**
