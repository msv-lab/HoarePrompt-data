`res.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `res`. The value of `i` is currently `marked`, so `res` will now include `marked`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Q` is non-empty except for the last element which has been removed, `v` is the last element of `Q` before it was removed, `nbr[v]` must be non-empty, `marked` contains the value of `i`, the current value of `i` is marked, and `res` contains `marked`.

Output State: **`Q` is non-empty except for the last element which has been removed, `v` is the last element of `Q` before it was removed, `nbr[v]` must be non-empty, `marked` contains the value of `i`, the current value of `i` is marked, `res` contains `marked`.**
