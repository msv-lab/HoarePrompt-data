`Q` appends the value of `i` to itself, changing its content. The value of `v` remains the last element of `Q` before the append operation, which was the value of `Q[-2]` before the last removal. `nbr[v]` must still be non-empty, `marked` contains the value of `i`, and `res` contains `marked`. Therefore, the updated state includes `Q` now containing one additional element `i`, and all other variables remain unchanged in their values.

Output State: **`Q` is non-empty with an additional element `i`, `v` is the second last element of `Q` before the append operation, `nbr[v]` must be non-empty, `marked` contains the value of `i`, `res` contains `marked`.**
