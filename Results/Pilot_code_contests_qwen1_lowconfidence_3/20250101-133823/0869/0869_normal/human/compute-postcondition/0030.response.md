Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr[l[1]]` is updated to include `l[0]` if `l[1]` was not already a key in `nbr`, and `cand` is updated accordingly. If `l[1]` was not in `nbr`, `nbr[l[1]]` is set to `[l[0]]` and `cand` contains `l[1]`. If `l[1]` was already a key in `nbr`, `nbr[l[1]]` is updated to include `l[0]` and `cand` becomes an empty set.***
