The code `cand.add(l[0])` adds the value of `l[0]` to the set `cand`. Given the initial state, the only variable directly impacted is `cand`.

- `i` is `previous_i + 1`.
- `n` is an integer input from the user.
- `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`.
- `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` (if `l[1]` was not already a key).
- `cand` is updated to `{l[1]}` if `l[1]` was not a key, otherwise `cand` is an empty set.

Since `cand` was initially updated based on `l[1]`, it now gets an additional element `l[0]`. Therefore, the new state of `cand` is `{l[1], l[0]}`.

Output State: **`i` is `previous_i + 1`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`, `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]`, `cand` is `{l[1], l[0]}`.**
