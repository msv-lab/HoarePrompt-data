`res.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `res`. The value of `i` is in `marked`, but its specific value is not given. The initial values of `v` and `nbr[v]` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `res` with `i` appended to it.

Output State: **`v` is a valid key in `nbr`, `nbr[v]` is not empty, `i` is in `marked`, `res` is `[i]`**
