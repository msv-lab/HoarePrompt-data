The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. This operation updates the value of the variable `l` to be the list of strings obtained from the input.

Given the initial states:
- `n` is the integer input from the user.
- `nbr` is a dictionary where the key is either `l[1]` or `l[0]` (depending on whether `l[1]` was already a key in `nbr`), and the value is a list containing the other element from `l`.
- `i` is currently 0.
- `l` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
- `cand` is a set containing the value `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key in `nbr`, or an empty set otherwise.

After executing `l = raw_input().split()`, the list `l` is updated to contain the split strings from the user input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary where the key is either `l[1]` or `l[0]` (depending on whether `l[1]` was already a key in `nbr`), the value is a list containing the other element from `l`, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings obtained from the user input, and `cand` is a set containing the value `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key in `nbr`, or an empty set otherwise.**
