The code snippet appends `l[0]` to `nbr[l[1]]`. Let's break down the impact:

1. **Previous State**: 
   - `i` is `previous_i + 1`.
   - `n` is an integer input from the user.
   - `nbr[l[0]]` becomes `[l[1]]` if `l[0]` is not already a key in `nbr`.
   - `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` if `l[0]` is not already a key.
   - `cand` is updated to `{l[1], l[0]}` if `l[0]` is not already a key.
   - `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` if `l[0]` is already a key.
   - `cand` does not include `l[0]` if `l[0]` is already a key.
   - `nbr[l[0]]` now includes `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key.

2. **Impact of Code**:
   - `nbr[l[1]].append(l[0])` adds `l[0]` to the list `nbr[l[1]]`.

Since the code only modifies `nbr[l[1]]`, the rest of the conditions and states remain unchanged.

**Output State:**
- `i` is `previous_i + 1`.
- `n` is an integer input from the user.
- `nbr[l[0]]` becomes `[l[1]]` if `l[0]` is not already a key in `nbr`.
- `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` (since `l[0]` is appended to `nbr[l[1]]`).
- `cand` is updated to `{l[1], l[0]}` if `l[0]` is not already a key.
- `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` if `l[0]` is already a key.
- `cand` does not include `l[0]` if `l[0]` is already a key.
- `nbr[l[0]]` now includes `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key.

Output State: **`i` is `previous_i + 1`; `n` is an integer input from the user; `nbr[l[0]]` becomes `[l[1]]` if `l[0]` is not already a key in `nbr`; `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]`; `cand` is updated to `{l[1], l[0]}` if `l[0]` is not already a key; `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` if `l[0]` is already a key; `cand` does not include `l[0]` if `l[0]` is already a key; `nbr[l[0]]` now includes `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key.**
