The code snippet `nbr[l[0]].append(l[1])` appends `l[1]` to the list `nbr[l[0]]`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. `i` is initialized to `previous_i + 1` in the initial state.
2. `n` is an integer input from the user.
3. `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` if `l[1]` was not already a key.
4. `cand` is updated to `{l[1]}` if `l[1]` was not a key, otherwise `cand` is an empty set.

After executing `nbr[l[0]].append(l[1])`:

- `i` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this line of code.
- `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this line of code.
- `nbr[l[1]]` will include `l[0]` if it was not already included.
- `cand` will be updated to `{l[1]}` if `l[1]` was not a key, otherwise it remains an empty set.
- `nbr[l[0]]` will now include `l[1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `previous_i + 1`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` if `l[1]` was not already a key, `cand` is updated to `{l[1]}` if `l[1]` was not a key, otherwise `cand` is an empty set, and `nbr[l[0]]` now includes `l[1]`.
Output State: **`i` is `previous_i + 1`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` if `l[1]` was not already a key, `cand` is updated to `{l[1]}` if `l[1]` was not a key, otherwise `cand` is an empty set, and `nbr[l[0]]` now includes `l[1]`**.
