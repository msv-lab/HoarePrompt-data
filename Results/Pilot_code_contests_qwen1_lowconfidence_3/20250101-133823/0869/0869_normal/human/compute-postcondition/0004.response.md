The code `l = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, and assigns the resulting list to `l`. However, the values of `n`, `nbr`, `cand`, and `i` are not directly affected by this operation. The initial state is that `n` is an integer input from the user representing the length of the list of tuples, `nbr` is an empty dictionary, `cand` is an empty set, and `i` is 0. After executing the code, `n` will remain as the integer input from the user, `nbr` will still be an empty dictionary, `cand` will still be an empty set, and `l` will be the list of strings obtained from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from the user, `nbr` is an empty dictionary, `cand` is an empty set, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
