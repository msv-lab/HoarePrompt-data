The code `n = int(raw_input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This input is expected to be the length of the list of tuples that represents the connections between cities. Since the input is taken directly from the user, the exact value of `n` is not specified in the initial state but will be provided during execution.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from the user, representing the length of the list of tuples**
