Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string and its value is a list of strings, `cand` is a set containing strings. For every pair of strings `(a, b)` where `a` is a key in `nbr` and `b` is in `nbr[a]`, there is an entry in `nbr[b]` that is `a`, and `cand` contains `b` if and only if `b` was added to `nbr` as a new key.**

Explanation:
- After all iterations of the loop, `nbr` will be a dictionary where each key represents a string and its value is a list of strings that are connected to it via the input process.
- Each time a new string `a` is encountered, if `a` is not already a key in `nbr`, it is added as a key with the corresponding value being a list containing the string `b`. Simultaneously, `b` is added to `cand`.
- If `a` is already a key in `nbr`, then `b` is appended to the list in `nbr[a]`, and `a` is removed from `cand`.
- Similarly, when processing `b`, the same logic applies. This ensures that both `a` and `b` are connected in `nbr`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0), then:
- `n` is 0.
- `nbr` is an empty dictionary `{}`.
- `cand` is an empty set `set()`.
