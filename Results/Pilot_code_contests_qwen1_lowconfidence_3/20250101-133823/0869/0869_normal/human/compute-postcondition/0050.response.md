Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string and its value is a list of strings, `cand` is a set containing strings that must be non-empty. The loop will always execute exactly once, as long as `cand` is non-empty, and the loop body does nothing (it just breaks out of the loop immediately). After the loop, `v` is any element of `cand`.**
