The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `res`. The initial state is given as `Q` is either `[i, i_next]` or `[i_next]`, `marked` includes `i_next` and `i`, and `res` includes `v` and `i`.

After running the line `res.append(i)`, the list `res` will include the value of `i` in addition to `v` and `i` (since `i` is already present in `res`).

- `Q` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it.
- `marked` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it.
- `res` is updated to include the value of `i`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`Q` is `[i, i_next]` or `[i_next]`, `marked` includes `i_next` and `i`, `res` includes `v`, `i`, and `i`.**
