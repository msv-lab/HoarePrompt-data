The code `cand.remove(l[1])` removes the element `l[1]` from the set `cand`. This means that `l[1]` is no longer in the set `cand`.

Based on the initial conditions:
- `i` is `previous_i + 1`.
- `n` is an integer input from the user.
- `nbr[l[0]]` is updated to include `[l[1]]` if `l[0]` is not already a key in `nbr`.
- `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` if `l[0]` is not already a key.
- `cand` is updated to `{l[1], l[0]}` if `l[0]` is not already a key.
- `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` if `l[0]` is already a key.
- `cand` does not include `l[0]` if `l[0]` is already a key.
- `nbr[l[0]]` now includes `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key.

After executing `cand.remove(l[1])`, the set `cand` will no longer contain `l[1]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is `previous_i + 1`; `n` is an integer input from the user; `nbr[l[0]]` includes `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key; `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` if `l[0]` is already a key; `cand` does not include `l[1]` if `l[0]` is already a key; `nbr[l[0]]` now includes `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key.**
