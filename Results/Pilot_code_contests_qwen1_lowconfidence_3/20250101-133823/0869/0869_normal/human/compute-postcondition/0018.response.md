Postcondition: ***`n` is the integer input from the user, `nbr` is a dictionary where the key is either `l[1]` or `l[0]` (depending on whether `l[1]` was already a key in `nbr`), the value is a list containing the other element from `l`, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings obtained from the input, and `cand` is a set containing the value `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key in `nbr`, or an empty set otherwise.***
