The code snippet `nbr[l[1]] = [l[0]]` updates the dictionary `nbr` by setting the value of the key `l[1]` to be a list containing `l[0]`. 

- Before the code runs, `nbr[l[1]]` is a list containing `[l[0], l[1]]` because of the previous line of code that added `l[1]` to the list and then appended `l[1]` again.
- After the code runs, the value of `nbr[l[1]]` will be updated to just `[l[0]]`.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `l`, `cand`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `nbr[l[1]]` is now `[l[0]]`, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings obtained from the user input, `cand` is a set containing the value `l[1]` if `l[1]` was not already a key in `nbr`, or an empty set otherwise, and `cand` is updated such that if `l[0]` was present, it is removed from `cand`.**
