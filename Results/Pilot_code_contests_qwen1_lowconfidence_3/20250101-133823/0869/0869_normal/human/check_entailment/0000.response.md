Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the graph formed by the stamps is not a simple path but a tree with multiple branches. Specifically, the program assumes that the graph is a simple path and performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to reconstruct the path, which may lead to incorrect results if the graph has branches.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
3 1
100 2
3 2
```
The correct output should be `100 2 3 1`, but the program will output `1 100 3 2` because it performs BFS and adds nodes to the result list in the order they are visited, without correctly handling the branching structure.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure it correctly handles the branching nature of the graph and reconstructs the path accordingly.
