Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the starting city is not explicitly removed from the candidate set `cand`. According to the problem description, the starting city is part of the valid route but might not be explicitly added or removed correctly in the program logic. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the starting city is part of the final route output.

Consider the following input:

```
3
3 1
1 100
100 2
```

Expected output should include the starting city, but the current implementation might miss it. Let's walk through the expected and actual outputs:

- Expected output: `2 100 1 3` or `3 1 100 2`
- Actual output: `100 2 3 1` or similar, but without the starting city `3`.

To fix this, the starting city should be explicitly included in the result list. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    nbr = dict()
    cand = set()
    for i in range(n):
        l = input().split()
        if l[0] not in nbr:
            nbr[l[0]] = [l[1]]
            cand.add(l[0])
        else:
            nbr[l[0]].append(l[1])
            cand.remove(l[0])
        if l[1] not in nbr:
            nbr[l[1]] = [l[0]]
            cand.add(l[1])
        else:
            nbr[l[1]].append(l[0])
            cand.remove(l[1])
    
    # Ensure the starting city is included
    start_city = None
    for v in cand:
        start_city = v
        break
    
    marked = set()
    marked.add(start_city)
    res = [start_city]
    Q = [start_city]
    while len(Q) > 0:
        v = Q.pop()
        for i in nbr[v]:
            if i not in marked:
                marked.add(i)
                res.append(i)
                Q.append(i)
    
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

func()
```

This ensures that the starting city is always included in the output, making the program correct according to the problem description.
