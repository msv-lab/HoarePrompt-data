You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Bob got a letter in an envelope. Bob knows that when Berland's post officers send a letter directly from city «A» to city «B», they stamp it with «A B», or «B A». Unfortunately, often it is impossible to send a letter directly from the city of the sender to the city of the receiver, that's why the letter is sent via some intermediate cities. Post officers never send a letter in such a way that the route of this letter contains some city more than once. Bob is sure that the post officers stamp the letters accurately.

There are n stamps on the envelope of Bob's letter. He understands that the possible routes of this letter are only two. But the stamps are numerous, and Bob can't determine himself none of these routes. That's why he asks you to help him. Find one of the possible routes of the letter.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — amount of mail stamps on the envelope. Then there follow n lines with two integers each — description of the stamps. Each stamp is described with indexes of the cities between which a letter is sent. The indexes of cities are integers from 1 to 109. Indexes of all the cities are different. Every time the letter is sent from one city to another, exactly one stamp is put on the envelope. It is guaranteed that the given stamps correspond to some valid route from some city to some other city. 

Output

Output n + 1 numbers — indexes of cities in one of the two possible routes of the letter.

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    nbr = dict()
    cand = set()
    for i in range(n):
        l = raw_input().split()
        if l[0] not in nbr:
            nbr[l[0]] = [l[1]]
            cand.add(l[0])
        else:
            nbr[l[0]].append(l[1])
            cand.remove(l[0])
        if l[1] not in nbr:
            nbr[l[1]] = [l[0]]
            cand.add(l[1])
        else:
            nbr[l[1]].append(l[0])
            cand.remove(l[1])
    for v in cand:
        break
    marked = set()
    marked.add(v)
    res = [v]
    Q = [v]
    while len(Q) > 0:
        v = Q.pop()
        for i in nbr[v]:
            if i not in marked:
                marked.add(i)
                res.append(i)
                Q.append(i)
    print(' '.join(res))


```
Output hints: The function processes a list of tuples representing connections between cities. It constructs a graph where each city is a node and each tuple represents an edge connecting two cities. The function then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from a randomly chosen node (determined by the `cand` set). The BFS ensures that no city is visited more than once and constructs a list (`res`) containing all unique cities reachable from the starting node. Finally, it prints the list of reachable cities in the order they were discovered. The function handles edge cases such as an empty input list or a single node graph. However, it does not handle disconnected graphs; in such cases, it only processes one connected component.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
