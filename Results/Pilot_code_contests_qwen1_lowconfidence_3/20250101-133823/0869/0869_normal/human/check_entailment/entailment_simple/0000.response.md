Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of stamps (`n`) and processes each stamp to build an adjacency list (`nbr`). This part ensures that all stamps are correctly parsed and stored.
   - The `cand` set is used to identify the starting point of the route. Since the stamps describe a valid route, there will always be at least one starting point from which the route can begin.

2. **Finding the Starting Point:**
   - The program iterates over the `cand` set to find the starting point. It breaks out of the loop after finding the first element, ensuring that it picks any valid starting point.

3. **Traversing the Route:**
   - Using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, the program traverses the graph starting from the chosen node (`v`). It uses a `marked` set to keep track of visited nodes and a queue (`Q`) to manage the traversal order.
   - The BFS ensures that all nodes reachable from the starting point are visited without revisiting any node, adhering to the constraint that no city is visited more than once.

4. **Output Generation:**
   - The result is stored in the list `res`, which is printed as a space-separated string. This matches the problem description’s requirement for the output format.

### Key Points:
- The program correctly handles the input format and constraints specified in the problem description.
- It finds a valid route through the graph, respecting the constraints that no city is visited more than once.
- The BFS approach ensures that the program finds one of the possible routes, and it always outputs the nodes in the correct order as required.

Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the expected output for all valid inputs, the program is correct.
