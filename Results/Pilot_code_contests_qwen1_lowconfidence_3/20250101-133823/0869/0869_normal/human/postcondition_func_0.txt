The function processes a list of tuples representing connections between cities. It constructs a graph where each city is a node and each tuple represents an edge connecting two cities. The function then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from a randomly chosen node (determined by the `cand` set). The BFS ensures that no city is visited more than once and constructs a list (`res`) containing all unique cities reachable from the starting node. Finally, it prints the list of reachable cities in the order they were discovered. The function handles edge cases such as an empty input list or a single node graph. However, it does not handle disconnected graphs; in such cases, it only processes one connected component.
