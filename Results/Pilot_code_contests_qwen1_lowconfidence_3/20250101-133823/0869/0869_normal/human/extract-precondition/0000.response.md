Precondition: **The input is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the indexes of cities connected by a stamp. The length of this list is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and each city index is an integer from 1 to 10^9. All city indexes are unique within each tuple, and the sequence of stamps corresponds to a valid route from one city to another without visiting any city more than once.**
