The function `func` does not accept any input parameters. Instead, it reads input from standard input. The input consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and the second line contains `n` positive integers, each not exceeding 5. 

The function processes this input but does not return anything based on the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read `n` positive integers from standard input, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.

Functionality: **The function reads `n` positive integers from standard input, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.**
