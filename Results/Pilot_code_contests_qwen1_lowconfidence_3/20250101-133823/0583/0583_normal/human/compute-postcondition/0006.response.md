`temp` is incremented by 1, which means `temp` is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial condition that \((s + i) \% k\) is 0 still holds true since no changes were made to `s`, `i`, or `k`. 

Output State: **`total` is undefined, `i` is 1, `n` is a string containing the input format (integer followed by n positive integers), `s` is 105, `k` is the string `n` concatenated with '1', `temp` is 1, and the current value of \((s + i) \% k\) is 0**
