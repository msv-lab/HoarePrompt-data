The value of `temp` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp` was 1, so now it is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is undefined, `i` is 2, `n` is a string containing the input format (integer followed by n positive integers), `s` is 105, `k` is the string `n` concatenated with '1', `temp` is 2.

Output State: **`total` is undefined, `i` is 2, `n` is a string containing the input format (integer followed by n positive integers), `s` is 105, `k` is the string `n` concatenated with '1', `temp` is 2**
