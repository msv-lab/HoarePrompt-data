Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `total` is undefined
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is a string containing the input format (integer followed by n positive integers)
   - `s` is 105
   - `k` is the string `n` concatenated with '1'
   - `temp` is 2

2. **For Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs for `i` in `range(5)`, which means it will run from `i = 0` to `i = 4`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - The loop condition is checked, and if `(s + i) % k` does not equal 0, `i` remains 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

4. **Current Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is 2, we need to check if `(s + i) % k` equals 0.
   - If `(s + i) % k` does not equal 0, `i` will remain 2.
   - If `(s + i) % k` equals 0, `i` will remain 2 (no change).

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 5.
   - Currently, `i` is 2, so we need to increment `i` to 3.

6. **States to Adjust:**
   - `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
   - No other variables should change based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the updated states at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:
- `total` is still undefined
- `i` is now 3
- `n` is still a string containing the input format (integer followed by n positive integers)
- `s` is still 105
- `k` is still the string `n` concatenated with '1'
- `temp` is still 2

State: **`total` is undefined, `i` is 3, `n` is a string containing the input format (integer followed by n positive integers), `s` is 105, `k` is the string `n` concatenated with '1', `temp` is 2**
