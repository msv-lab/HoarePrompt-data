Postcondition: ***`total` is undefined, `i` is 2, `n` is a string containing the input format (integer followed by n positive integers), `s` is 105, `k` is the string `n` concatenated with '1', `temp` is 2. If `(s + i) % k` equals 0, `i` remains 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
