Output State: **`total` is undefined, `i` is 5, `n` is a string containing the input format (integer followed by n positive integers), `s` is 105, `k` is the string `n` concatenated with '1', `temp` is either 0 or the number of times `(s + i) % k` is 0 for `i` in the range [0, 4].**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `n` is a string containing the input format (integer followed by n positive integers).
   - `s` is 105.
   - `k` is the string `n` concatenated with '1'.
   - `temp` is 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs for 5 iterations (`i` ranges from 0 to 4).

3. **Condition Check:**
   - For each iteration, the condition `(s + i) % k == 0` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, `temp` is incremented by 1.

4. **Final Values:**
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be 5 because the loop increments `i` from 0 to 4.
   - `s` remains 105 throughout the loop.
   - `k` remains the string `n` concatenated with '1'.
   - `temp` will be the count of how many times `(s + i) % k` evaluates to 0 for `i` in the range [0, 4]. This means `temp` will be 0 if none of the conditions were met, or it could be between 1 and 5 depending on how many times the condition was satisfied.

Thus, the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop is as described above.
