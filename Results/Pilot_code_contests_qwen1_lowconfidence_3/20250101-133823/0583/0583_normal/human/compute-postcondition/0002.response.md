The code `k = n + 1` attempts to add 1 to the string `n`. Since `n` is a string containing the input format (an integer followed by n positive integers), adding 1 to this string does not produce a meaningful result and is treated as a string concatenation operation. Thus, `k` will be a string that is the concatenation of `n` and the string representation of 1.

- The value of `s` remains unchanged at 105.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a string.
- The new value of `k` is the string `n` concatenated with '1'.

Output State: **`n` is a string containing the input format (integer followed by n positive integers), `s` is 105, `k` is the string `n` concatenated with '1'.**
