Postcondition: ***`total` is undefined, `i` is 1, `n` is a string containing the input format (integer followed by n positive integers), `s` is 105, `k` is the string `n` concatenated with '1', `temp` is 1, and the current value of \((s + i) \% k\) is 0.*** 

Explanation: Since the else part is not present, the overall postcondition directly reflects the postcondition of the if part. The condition \((s + i) \% k == 0\) being true leads to the specified values for `i` and `temp`.
