The code `s = sum(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes the input from the user in the format specified by the string `n` (which contains an integer followed by n positive integers), splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then calculates the sum of these integers and assigns it to `s`.

Since the initial state includes that `n` is a string containing the input format (integer followed by n positive integers), and the other variables are unchanged, after executing the code:

- `n` remains unchanged as it was only used to describe the input format.
- `s` is assigned the sum of the integers obtained from the input.

Let's assume the user inputs "5 10 20 30 40" as per the format described by `n`. The code would then process this input as follows:
1. `raw_input().split()` would split the input into a list of strings: `['5', '10', '20', '30', '40']`.
2. `map(int, ['5', '10', '20', '30', '40'])` would convert each string to an integer: `[5, 10, 20, 30, 40]`.
3. `sum([5, 10, 20, 30, 40])` would calculate the sum: `105`.

Therefore, after executing the code, `s` would be assigned the value `105`.

Output State: **`n` is a string containing the input format (integer followed by n positive integers), `s` is 105**
