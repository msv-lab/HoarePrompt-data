The code initializes `temp` to 0. The values of `n`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `n` is a string containing the input format (integer followed by n positive integers), `s` is 105, and `k` is the string `n` concatenated with '1'. The only change is the introduction of the variable `temp` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`n` is a string containing the input format (integer followed by n positive integers), `s` is 105, `k` is the string `n` concatenated with '1', and `temp` is 0.**
