Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the total number of fingers shown plus the number of fingers Dima shows results in Dima being chosen to clean the place. Specifically, the program incorrectly counts the number of valid finger configurations for Dima such that he does not have to clean the place.

For example, consider the following input:

Input:
```
2
3 5
```

According to the problem description, Dima should be able to show 1, 3, or 5 fingers to avoid cleaning the place. However, the program will incorrectly count the number of valid configurations.

Let's break down the issue:
- There are 2 friends, so `k = n + 1 = 3`.
- The total number of fingers shown by the friends is `3 + 5 = 8`.
- The program checks for which values of `i` (0 to 4) `(8 + i) % 3 != 0`. This will correctly identify that `i = 2` is invalid because `(8 + 2) % 3 == 0`, but it does not account for the fact that Dima showing 1, 3, or 5 fingers can still result in him not having to clean the place if the total modulo condition is met.

The program should correctly count the valid configurations by ensuring that `(s + i) % k != 0` for all possible values of `i` (1 to 5), but instead it incorrectly counts the invalid ones and subtracts them from 5.

To fix this, the program should correctly identify the valid configurations by checking that `(s + i) % k != 0` for `i` in the range 1 to 5.
