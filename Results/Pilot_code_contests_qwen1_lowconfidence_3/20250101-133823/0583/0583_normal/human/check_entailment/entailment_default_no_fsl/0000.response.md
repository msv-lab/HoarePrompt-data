Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the code calculates the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that he ends up having to clean the place, rather than calculating the number of ways he can avoid cleaning the place.

According to the problem description, Dima needs to find the number of ways to show some number of fingers (1 to 5) such that he does not end up having to clean the place. However, the code calculates the number of ways he ends up having to clean the place and subtracts this from 5.

To fix this, the code should count the number of valid ways Dima can show fingers such that the condition \((s + i) \% (n+1) != 0\) is true for \(i\) in the range [1, 5]. This would involve changing the `temp` variable to count only the cases where Dima does not end up having to clean the place.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = sum(map(int, input().split()))
    k = n + 1
    temp = 0
    for i in range(1, 6):  # Check for i in the range [1, 5]
        if (s + i) % k != 0:
            temp += 1
    print(temp)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that Dima counts the number of valid ways he can show fingers such that he does not have to clean the place, which aligns with the problem description.
