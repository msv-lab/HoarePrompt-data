Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The code calculates the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that the counting-out game does not land on him, but it does not actually compute this correctly. Specifically:

- The code reads the number of friends \( n \) and the sum of the fingers shown by his friends \( s \).
- It then iterates over possible numbers of fingers Dima could show (0 to 4) and checks if \((s + i) \% (n + 1) == 0\).
- If \((s + i) \% (n + 1) == 0\) for any \( i \), it increments a counter \( temp \).

However, the logic here is flawed. The goal is to find the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that the result \((s + i) \% (n + 1)\) is not equal to 0. The current implementation counts the number of ways that would result in Dima being chosen, and then subtracts this from 5. Instead, it should directly count the number of valid \( i \) values (0 to 4) that do not result in Dima being chosen.

A corrected version of the logic would be:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = sum(map(int, input().split()))
    k = n + 1
    temp = 0
    for i in range(5):
        if (s + i) % k != 0:
            temp += 1
    print(temp)
```

This corrected version correctly counts the number of valid ways Dima can show fingers such that he does not have to clean the place. The original code does not meet this requirement and thus is incorrect.
