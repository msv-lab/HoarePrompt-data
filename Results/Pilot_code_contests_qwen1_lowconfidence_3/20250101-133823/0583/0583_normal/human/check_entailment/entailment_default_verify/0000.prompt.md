You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Dima and his friends have been playing hide and seek at Dima's place all night. As a result, Dima's place got messy. In the morning they decided that they need to clean the place.

To decide who exactly would clean the apartment, the friends want to play a counting-out game. First, all the guys stand in a circle, and then each of them shows some number of fingers on one hand (one to five), and then the boys count in a circle, starting from Dima, the number of people, respective to the total number of fingers shown. The person on who the countdown stops will clean the apartment.

For example, if Dima and one of his friends played hide and seek, and 7 fingers were shown during the counting-out, then Dima would clean the place. If there were 2 or say, 8 fingers shown, then his friend would clean the place.

Dima knows how many fingers each of his friends will show during the counting-out. Now he is interested in the number of ways to show some number of fingers on one hand (one to five), so that he did not have to clean the place. Help Dima.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of Dima's friends. Dima himself isn't considered to be his own friend. The second line contains n positive integers, not exceeding 5, representing, how many fingers the Dima's friends will show. 

The numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.

Output

In a single line print the answer to the problem.

Examples

1


Output

3


Input

2


Output

2


Input

2
3 5


Output

3

Note

In the first sample Dima can show 1, 3 or 5 fingers. If Dima shows 3 fingers, then the counting-out will go like that: Dima, his friend, Dima, his friend.

In the second sample Dima can show 2 or 4 fingers.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = input()
    s = sum(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    k = n + 1
    temp = 0
    for i in range(5):
        if (s + i) % k == 0:
            temp += 1
    print(5 - temp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the total number of fingers shown is greater than 5. According to the problem description, each person can show between 1 and 5 fingers. However, the program does not account for this constraint, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, if Dima has 2 friends and they show 3 and 5 fingers respectively, the total number of fingers shown is \(3 + 5 = 8\). Since the program calculates \((s + i) \% k\) without checking if the total number of fingers exceeds 5, it will incorrectly consider values of \(i\) that are not valid (e.g., \(i = 0\) because \(8 + 0 = 8\), which is not possible since the maximum number of fingers is 5).

A correct approach would involve ensuring that the total number of fingers does not exceed 5 and then calculating the number of valid finger configurations for Dima.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads a positive integer \( n \) from standard input, followed by \( n \) positive integers, and calculates the number of integers \( i \) in the range \([0, 4]\) such that \((s + i) \% (n+1) == 0\), where \( s \) is the sum of the \( n \) integers. It then prints the count of such integers. If no such \( i \) exists, it prints 5.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
