Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the program calculates the number of ways Dima can show a number of fingers such that he does not have to clean the apartment, but it does not correctly determine whether Dima would clean the apartment based on the total number of fingers shown.

#### Issues:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of friends `n` and the number of fingers each friend will show.
   
2. **Calculation of Total Fingers**:
   - The program sums the number of fingers shown by Dima's friends using `s = sum(map(int, raw_input().split()))`. This part is correct.

3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The program enters a `for` loop where it checks for each possible number of fingers Dima could show (from 0 to 4) whether `(s + i) % (n + 1) == 0`. This logic incorrectly assumes that the total fingers shown plus Dimaâ€™s fingers should be divisible by the number of people (including Dima). This is not the intended logic based on the problem description.
   - According to the problem description, Dima should be counted in the sequence, and the person on whom the countdown stops will clean the place. Therefore, the modulo operation should be done with respect to the total number of participants (Dima + his friends).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints `5 - temp`, which gives the number of ways Dima can avoid cleaning the apartment. However, the logic to determine whether Dima would clean the apartment is flawed as explained above.

#### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach would involve checking for each possible number of fingers Dima could show (from 1 to 5) whether the total number of fingers shown plus the fingers Dima shows is not divisible by the total number of participants (Dima + his friends).
- Specifically, Dima should check if `(s + i) % (n + 1) != 0` for `i` in the range [1, 5].

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = sum(map(int, input().split()))
    k = n + 1
    temp = 0
    for i in range(1, 6):
        if (s + i) % k != 0:
            temp += 1
    
    print(temp)
```

This corrected program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It checks for each possible number of fingers Dima could show and counts the number of ways Dima can avoid having to clean the apartment.
