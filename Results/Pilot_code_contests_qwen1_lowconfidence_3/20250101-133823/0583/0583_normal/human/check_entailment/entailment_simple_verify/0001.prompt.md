You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Dima and his friends have been playing hide and seek at Dima's place all night. As a result, Dima's place got messy. In the morning they decided that they need to clean the place.

To decide who exactly would clean the apartment, the friends want to play a counting-out game. First, all the guys stand in a circle, and then each of them shows some number of fingers on one hand (one to five), and then the boys count in a circle, starting from Dima, the number of people, respective to the total number of fingers shown. The person on who the countdown stops will clean the apartment.

For example, if Dima and one of his friends played hide and seek, and 7 fingers were shown during the counting-out, then Dima would clean the place. If there were 2 or say, 8 fingers shown, then his friend would clean the place.

Dima knows how many fingers each of his friends will show during the counting-out. Now he is interested in the number of ways to show some number of fingers on one hand (one to five), so that he did not have to clean the place. Help Dima.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of Dima's friends. Dima himself isn't considered to be his own friend. The second line contains n positive integers, not exceeding 5, representing, how many fingers the Dima's friends will show. 

The numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.

Output

In a single line print the answer to the problem.

Note

In the first sample Dima can show 1, 3 or 5 fingers. If Dima shows 3 fingers, then the counting-out will go like that: Dima, his friend, Dima, his friend.

In the second sample Dima can show 2 or 4 fingers.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = input()
    s = sum(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    k = n + 1
    temp = 0
    for i in range(5):
        if (s + i) % k == 0:
            temp += 1
    print(5 - temp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the total number of fingers shown plus the number of fingers Dima shows results in Dima being chosen to clean the place. Specifically, the program incorrectly counts the number of valid finger configurations for Dima such that he does not have to clean the place.

For example, consider the following input:

Input:
```
2
3 5
```

According to the problem description, Dima should be able to show 1, 3, or 5 fingers to avoid cleaning the place. However, the program will incorrectly count the number of valid configurations.

Let's break down the issue:
- There are 2 friends, so `k = n + 1 = 3`.
- The total number of fingers shown by the friends is `3 + 5 = 8`.
- The program checks for which values of `i` (0 to 4) `(8 + i) % 3 != 0`. This will correctly identify that `i = 2` is invalid because `(8 + 2) % 3 == 0`, but it does not account for the fact that Dima showing 1, 3, or 5 fingers can still result in him not having to clean the place if the total modulo condition is met.

The program should correctly count the valid configurations by ensuring that `(s + i) % k != 0` for all possible values of `i` (1 to 5), but instead it incorrectly counts the invalid ones and subtracts them from 5.

To fix this, the program should correctly identify the valid configurations by checking that `(s + i) % k != 0` for `i` in the range 1 to 5.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. However, the input is expected to be read from standard input in the format described in the problem description, where the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and the second line contains n positive integers not exceeding 5.
def func():
    n = input()
    s = sum(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    k = n + 1
    temp = 0
    for i in range(5):
        if (s + i) % k == 0:
            temp += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is undefined, `i` is 5, `n` is a string containing the input format (integer followed by n positive integers), `s` is 105, `k` is the string `n` concatenated with '1', `temp` is either 0 or the number of times `(s + i) % k` is 0 for `i` in the range [0, 4].
    print(5 - temp)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
