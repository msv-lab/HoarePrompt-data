The function reads a positive integer \( n \) from standard input, followed by \( n \) positive integers, and calculates the number of integers \( i \) in the range \([0, 4]\) such that \((s + i) \% (n+1) == 0\), where \( s \) is the sum of the \( n \) integers. It then prints the count of such integers. If no such \( i \) exists, it prints 5.
