Postcondition: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `s` is a list of `n` elements, each element being one of 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE', and `s` must have at least two elements. If the current element in `s` is 'AC', `ac` is either incremented to 2 or set to 1, `wa` remains unchanged, `tle` remains unchanged, and `re` remains unchanged. If the current element in `s` is not 'AC', `ac` remains unchanged, `wa` is incremented to 2 if it was previously 1, `tle` is incremented by 1 if the current element in `s` is 'TLE', and `re` is incremented by 1 if the current element in `s` is 'RE'.**
