`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. Since `at_start` is `False`, the condition `if not at_start` is true, which means both the string representation of `x` and `sep` will be written to the file. However, the value of `at_start` remains unchanged, and the value of `sep` is not mentioned, so it's assumed to be undefined or unchanged.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, the string representation of `x` and `sep` are written to the file.**
