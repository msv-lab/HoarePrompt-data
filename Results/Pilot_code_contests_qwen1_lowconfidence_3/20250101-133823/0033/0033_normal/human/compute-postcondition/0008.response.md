The variable `at_start` is initially set to a boolean value and does not change. The string representation of `x` is written to the file, but this action itself does not affect the variables' values. The code simply assigns `False` to `at_start`.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, the string representation of `x` is written to the file**
