The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and `s`, which is a list of strings where each string in `s` is either 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE'. The function does not return an explicit value based on the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and a list `s` of specific strings, without returning any value.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and a list `s` of strings where each string in `s` is either 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE', without returning any value.**
