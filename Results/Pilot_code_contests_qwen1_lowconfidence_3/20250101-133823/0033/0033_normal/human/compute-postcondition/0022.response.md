`file.flush()` is called, which flushes the output buffer of `file`. Since the initial value of `flush` was `False`, it remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty tuple, `sep` is the original value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the original value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, `kwargs` does not contain the key 'end', `flush` is `False`.**
