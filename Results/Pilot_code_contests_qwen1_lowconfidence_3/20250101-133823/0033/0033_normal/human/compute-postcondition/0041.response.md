The function `func_2('AC x', ac)` is called with two arguments: the string `'AC x'` and the variable `ac`. However, the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, so we can only infer that it likely uses these arguments to modify the value of `ac`. Since no specific details about `func_2` are given, we cannot determine exactly what changes it makes to `ac`. 

Given this, the only variable that is explicitly modified by the code is `ac`. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `wa`, `tle`, and `re`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `s` is a list of `n` elements, each element being one of 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE', `ac` is modified by `func_2('AC x', ac)`, `wa` is the count of 'WA' in `s`, `tle` is the count of 'TLE' in `s`, and `re` is the count of 'RE' in `s`.**
