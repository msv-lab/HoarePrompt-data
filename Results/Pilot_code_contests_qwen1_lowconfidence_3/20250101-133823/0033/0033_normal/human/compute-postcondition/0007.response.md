`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` into the file. However, the given initial state does not provide a specific value for `x`. Since the code does not modify the value of `at_start`, it remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `at_start` is a boolean, and the value of `at_start` does not change; the string representation of `x` is written to the file.

Output State: **`at_start` is a boolean, the value of `at_start` does not change; the string representation of `x` is written to the file**
