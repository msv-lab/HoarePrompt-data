According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop will execute as long as `args` contains at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration, `at_start` is `False`. This means the loop has already started and at least one iteration has occurred. For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must contain at least one more element.

To summarize the necessary adjustments:
- Since the loop is iterating over `args`, and `at_start` being `False` indicates that the loop has already started, the key adjustment is to ensure `args` still contains at least one element for another iteration.

State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` must contain at least one element**
