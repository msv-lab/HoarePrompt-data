Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Control Variables**: The loop iterates over `args`. Therefore, the loop can execute if `args` is a non-empty iterable (i.e., it contains at least one string).

2. **Initial States Provided**:
   - `args` is a variable-length argument list containing strings representing verdicts (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, or `RE`).
   - `kwargs` does not contain keys `'sep'` and `'file'`.
   - `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`.
   - `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`.
   - `at_start` is `True`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `args` is a list of strings, we need to ensure that `args` is non-empty. If `args` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - The values of `kwargs`, `sep`, and `file` are derived from the pop operation but do not affect the loop's execution directly. The only relevant part here is that they are set up correctly.

Therefore, the critical state to adjust is ensuring that `args` contains at least one element.

**State:**
**`args` must contain at least one string, kwargs does not contain keys 'sep' and 'file', sep is the value of kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), file is the value of kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout), at_start is True**
