The code assigns the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` to `sep` and the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` to `file`. This means that `kwargs` will lose the keys `'sep'` and `'file'`, and their corresponding values will be assigned to `sep` and `file` respectively. The other elements of `kwargs` remain unchanged.

Let's denote the initial values as follows:
- `args` is a variable-length argument list containing strings representing verdicts (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, or `RE`).
- `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain keyword arguments `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` to customize the output behavior.

After executing the code, `kwargs` will no longer contain the keys `'sep'` and `'file'`, but it might still contain the keys `end` and `flush` along with their respective values. `sep` and `file` will be assigned the values from `kwargs` or default values if those keys do not exist in `kwargs`.

Output State: **`args` is a variable-length argument list containing strings representing verdicts (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, or `RE`); `kwargs` does not contain keys `'sep'` and `'file'`, `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`**
