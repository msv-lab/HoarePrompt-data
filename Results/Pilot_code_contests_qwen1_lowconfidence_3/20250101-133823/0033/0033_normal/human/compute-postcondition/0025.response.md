Functionality: **The function `func_2` takes a variable-length argument list `args` containing strings representing verdicts (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, or `RE`) and a keyword argument dictionary `kwargs` for customizing output behavior. It prints these verdicts to a specified stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`) with optional separation, end character, and flushing. After executing, the function does not return a value. The final state of the program includes the following:
- The `args` tuple is empty.
- The `sep` variable retains its original value after being popped from `kwargs`.
- The `file` variable retains its original value after being popped from `kwargs`.
- The `at_start` flag is set to `False` due to the for loop's iteration.
- If `kwargs` contains the key 'end', it will no longer have that key after the function execution.
- If `kwargs` contains the key 'flush' with a value of `True`, the associated stream will be flushed; otherwise, the function completes without further changes.**

This summary covers all the potential cases and ensures that only the actions performed by the actual code are included, adhering to the provided annotations while verifying their accuracy.
