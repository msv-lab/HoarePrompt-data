The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` impacts the `kwargs` dictionary by popping the key `'end'` with a default value of `\n`. Since the initial state of `kwargs` is derived from `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` and `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, and there is no initial value provided for `'end'` in these, `kwargs` remains unchanged.

- `at_start` is `False`.
- `args` is an empty tuple.
- `sep` is the original value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`.
- `file` is the original value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`.

After the execution of the code, the dictionary `kwargs` loses the key `'end'` and its value is set to `\n`. However, since `kwargs` is not explicitly stored in the output, the focus remains on the changes to the variables that were affected.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty tuple, `sep` is the original value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the original value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout), `kwargs` does not contain the key 'end'.**
