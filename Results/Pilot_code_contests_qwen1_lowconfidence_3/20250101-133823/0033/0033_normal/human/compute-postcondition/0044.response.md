The function `func_2('RE x', re)` is called with the arguments 'RE x' and `re`. This function modifies the variable `re` by incrementing it by the value of `x`. The value of `x` is derived from the argument 'RE x', which implies that `x` is the count of 'RE' in the list `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer input by the user.
- `s` is a list of `n` elements, each element being one of 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE'.
- `ac` is modified by `func_2('AC x', ac)`.
- `wa` is the count of 'WA' in `s` incremented by 1.
- `tle` is the count of 'TLE' in `s` incremented by 1.
- `re` is the count of 'RE' in `s`.

After the line `func_2('RE x', re)` is executed:
- The value of `re` is updated by adding the count of 'RE' in `s` (denoted as `x`).
- The counts of `ac`, `wa`, and `tle` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input by the user; `s` is a list of `n` elements, each element being one of 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE'; `ac` is modified by `func_2('AC x', ac)`, `wa` is the count of 'WA' in `s` incremented by 1, `tle` is the count of 'TLE' in `s` incremented by 1, `re` is the count of 'RE' in `s` incremented by the count of 'RE' in `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user; `s` is a list of `n` elements, each element being one of 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE'; `ac` is modified by `func_2('AC x', ac)`, `wa` is the count of 'WA' in `s` incremented by 1, `tle` is the count of 'TLE' in `s` incremented by 1, `re` is the count of 'RE' in `s` incremented by the count of 'RE' in `s`.**
