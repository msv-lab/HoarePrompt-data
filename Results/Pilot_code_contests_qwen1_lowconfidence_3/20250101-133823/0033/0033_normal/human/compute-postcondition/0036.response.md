Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input by the user, `s` is a list of `n` elements (one of which has already been processed), `ac`, `wa`, `tle`, and `re` are updated, and `s` must have at least two elements remaining. If `i` equals 'RE', `re` is incremented by 1. Since there is no else part, no other changes occur.***
