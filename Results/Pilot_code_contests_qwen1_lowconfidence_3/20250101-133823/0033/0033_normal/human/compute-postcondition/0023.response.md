Postcondition: ***`at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty tuple, `sep` is the original value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the original value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, `kwargs` does not contain the key 'end'. If `flush` is `False`, the function continues without further changes. If `flush` is `True`, the function flushes the output stream (associated with `file`).***
