`file.write(sep)` writes the content of the variable `sep` to the file, but this operation does not affect the values of the variables `at_start` and `args`. The value of `sep` itself is not given, so we cannot specify its exact value, but we know that it is written to the file.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` must contain at least one element**
