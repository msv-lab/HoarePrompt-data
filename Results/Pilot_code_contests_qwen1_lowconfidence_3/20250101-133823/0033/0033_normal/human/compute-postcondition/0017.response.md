The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file `file`. This operation does not change the value of `x` or the boolean value of `at_start`. The precondition that `at_start` remains `False` and `args` contains at least one element is not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `args` contains at least one element, and the string representation of `x` has been written to the file.**
