Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and a list `s` of strings where each string in `s` is either 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE'. It counts the occurrences of each string in `s` and then calls another function `func_2` with formatted strings and their respective counts. After executing the function, the state of the program includes the original integer `n` and list `s`, along with the counts `ac`, `wa`, `tle`, and `re` of 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', and 'RE' respectively. There are no return values. Potential edge cases include the input constraints for `n` and the validity of strings in `s`. The function also does not handle cases where `s` contains elements other than 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE', which could lead to incorrect count values.**
