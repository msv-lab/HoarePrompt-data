Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input by the user, `s` is a list of `n` elements with one already processed and at least two elements remaining. If `i` equals 'WA', `wa` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `wa` remains unchanged and either `tle` or `re` is incremented by 1 depending on the value of `i`. `ac` remains unchanged in both cases.***
