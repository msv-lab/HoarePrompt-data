`func_2('WA x', wa)` is called, which means the function `func_2` takes the string `'WA x'` and the variable `wa` as arguments. Inside the function, `wa` is incremented by 1 because the argument `'WA x'` suggests incrementing the count of 'WA'. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `ac`, `tle`, and `re`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user; `s` is a list of `n` elements, each element being one of 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE'; `ac` is modified by `func_2('AC x', ac)`, `wa` is the count of 'WA' in `s` incremented by 1, `tle` is the count of 'TLE' in `s`, and `re` is the count of 'RE' in `s`.**
