The given code is a docstring for the `print` function, which describes its behavior but does not actually change any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **args is a variable-length argument list containing strings representing verdicts (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, or `RE`), and kwargs is a dictionary that can contain keyword arguments `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` to customize the output behavior.**
