`file.write(sep)` writes the string `sep` to the file. The initial state indicates that the string representation of `x` was written to the file, but the value of `at_start` is `False`. This operation does not affect the value of `at_start`, but it does write `sep` to the file. The output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, the string representation of `x` and `sep` are written to the file**
