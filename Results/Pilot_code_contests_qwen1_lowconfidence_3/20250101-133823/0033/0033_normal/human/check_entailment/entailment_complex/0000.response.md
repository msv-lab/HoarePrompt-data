Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code follows the problem description for every potential case. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases and a list of strings `s` containing the verdicts for each test case. This adheres to the problem description.

2. **Counting Verdicts**: The code uses a straightforward loop to count the occurrences of 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', and 'RE' in the list `s`. This correctly implements the counting logic as described.

3. **Output Format**: The code prints the counts of each verdict in the required format, using the `func_2` function to format the output. This matches the problem description exactly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the maximum possible value of `n` (up to \(10^5\)) and processes each string in `s` appropriately.
   - The `func_2` function ensures that the output is formatted correctly and can handle different customization options (though the problem description doesn't specify any customization, the function is flexible).

5. **Annotations**: The annotations correctly summarize the state of the program before and after the functions are called, indicating that the code handles all cases as described.

Since the code processes the input correctly, handles the counting logic accurately, and formats the output as required, and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the code does not handle, the code is correct according to the problem description.
