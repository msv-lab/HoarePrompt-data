Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided in `func_1` appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings representing the verdicts for each test case. The code then counts the occurrences of each verdict ('AC', 'WA', 'TLE', 'RE') and prints the counts in the required format.

From the output hints for `func_1`, we can confirm that the function processes the input as expected, counting the occurrences of each verdict type and printing them in the specified format. The edge cases mentioned (e.g., invalid strings in the list `s`) are not relevant since the problem description guarantees that the input will be valid.

Since the code handles all the required cases as specified and produces the correct output format, the program is correct.
