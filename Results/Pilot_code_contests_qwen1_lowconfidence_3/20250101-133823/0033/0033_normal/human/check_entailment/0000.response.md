Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts and prints the number of test cases for each verdict type (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, `RE`). The program iterates through the list of verdicts and increments the respective counters based on the verdict type. It then uses the helper function `func_2` to print the results in the required format.

Since the program handles all given constraints and examples correctly, and there are no apparent logical flaws or edge cases that the program does not handle, the program is correct.
