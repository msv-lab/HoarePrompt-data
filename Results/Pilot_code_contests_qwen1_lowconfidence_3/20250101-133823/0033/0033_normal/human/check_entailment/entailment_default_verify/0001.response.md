Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the code. The program correctly counts the occurrences of each verdict (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, `RE`) and prints them in the specified format. The output hints confirm that `func_2` behaves as expected, handling the printing logic appropriately. There are no contradictions between the problem description, the code, and the output hints that would suggest any issues with the program's correctness. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness as **True** is justified.
