Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly counts the occurrences of each verdict (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, `RE`) and prints them in the required format using the `func_2` function. The output hints confirm that `func_2` behaves as expected, printing the verdicts and their counts correctly. There are no logical flaws or issues with the provided code that would cause it to fail under valid input conditions. Thus, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
