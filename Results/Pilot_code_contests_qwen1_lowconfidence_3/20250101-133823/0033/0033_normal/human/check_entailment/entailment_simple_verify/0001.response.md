Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The program correctly processes the input, counts the occurrences of each verdict (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, `RE`), and prints the results in the specified format. The annotations provide clear descriptions of the state of the program at various points, confirming that the program behaves as expected. Specifically:

- The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the list of verdicts.
- It accurately counts the occurrences of each verdict.
- It calls the `func_2` function to print the counts in the required format.

There are no logical errors or deviations from the problem requirements as indicated by the annotations. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
