Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list of verdicts and counts the occurrences of each type (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, `RE`). It then prints the counts in the specified format. Since the program handles all given constraints and examples correctly, and there are no apparent edge cases or logical errors, the program is considered correct.
