#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and a list `s` of strings where each string in `s` is either 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE'. It counts the occurrences of each string in `s` and then calls another function `func_2` with formatted strings and their respective counts. After executing the function, the state of the program includes the original integer `n` and list `s`, along with the counts `ac`, `wa`, `tle`, and `re` of 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', and 'RE' respectively. There are no return values. Potential edge cases include the input constraints for `n` and the validity of strings in `s`. The function also does not handle cases where `s` contains elements other than 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE', which could lead to incorrect count values.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a variable-length argument list containing strings representing verdicts (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, or `RE`), and kwargs is a dictionary that can contain keyword arguments `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` to customize the output behavior.
def func_2():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty tuple, `sep` is the original value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the original value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty tuple, `sep` is the original value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the original value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, `kwargs` does not contain the key 'end'. If `flush` is `False`, the function continues without further changes. If `flush` is `True`, the function flushes the output stream (associated with `file`).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a variable-length argument list `args` containing strings representing verdicts (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, or `RE`) and a keyword argument dictionary `kwargs` for customizing output behavior. It prints these verdicts to a specified stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`) with optional separation, end character, and flushing. After executing, the function does not return a value. The final state of the program includes the following:
- The `args` tuple is empty.
- The `sep` variable retains its original value after being popped from `kwargs`.
- The `file` variable retains its original value after being popped from `kwargs`.
- The `at_start` flag is set to `False` due to the for loop's iteration.
- If `kwargs` contains the key 'end', it will no longer have that key after the function execution.
- If `kwargs` contains the key 'flush' with a value of `True`, the associated stream will be flushed; otherwise, the function completes without further changes.
