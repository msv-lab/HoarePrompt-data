According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. For the loop to execute again, `c` must be greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `c` was greater than 0, and `s` was updated by appending the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space.

For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must still be greater than 0. Since `c` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it needs to remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`c` must be greater than 0, `s` has been updated by appending the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space**
