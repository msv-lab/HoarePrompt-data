`s` is assigned the value of `s` plus the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space. The variable `c` remains greater than 0, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is greater than 0; `s` is updated by appending the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 0; `s` is updated by appending the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space**
