The code `s = ''` assigns an empty string to `s`. This removes the previous value of `s` which was the concatenation of the string representations of `l[i][j]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `r-1` followed by `r` spaces. The other variables (`c`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an empty string, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is `r`, `j` is `c`**
