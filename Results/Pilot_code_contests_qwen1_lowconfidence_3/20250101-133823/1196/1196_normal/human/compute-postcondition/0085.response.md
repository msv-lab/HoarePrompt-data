According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `r`. If `i` is less than `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is an empty string plus a single character from `l[r][c]` followed by a space, plus `str(l[r+1][c]) + ' '`, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is `r + 1`, `j` is `c`, and `r` is greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be less than `r`.
- Since `i` is currently `r + 1`, it needs to be set to `r` or less.
- `r` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

So, we need to adjust the value of `i` to `r` (since `i` should be `r` or less for the loop to execute).

State: **`s` is an empty string plus a single character from `l[r][c]` followed by a space, plus `str(l[r+1][c]) + ' '`, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is `r`, `j` is `c`, `r` must be greater than 0**
