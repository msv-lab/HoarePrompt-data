Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `c` is greater than 0.
- `s` is an empty string (`''`).
- `j` is `c - 1`.
- `i` must be less than `r`.
- `s` is not printed.

### Loop Code
```python
for j in range(c):
    s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **First Iteration (j = 0):**
   - `s` is updated to `s + str(l[i][0]) + ' '`
   
2. **Second Iteration (j = 1):**
   - `s` is updated to `s + str(l[i][1]) + ' '`
   
3. **Third Iteration (j = 2):**
   - `s` is updated to `s + str(l[i][2]) + ' '`
   
4. **...**
   
5. **Final Iteration (j = c - 1):**
   - `s` is updated to `s + str(l[i][c - 1]) + ' '`

### Final State Analysis
- After the loop completes, `j` will be equal to `c` because the loop runs `c` times.
- `s` will be the concatenation of `str(l[i][j]) + ' '` for all `j` from `0` to `c - 1`.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute
- The loop will execute as long as `j < c`. Since `j` starts at `0` and increments by `1` each time, it will reach `c - 1` and then the loop condition `j < c` will no longer be true, causing the loop to terminate.

### Final Output State
- `c` remains greater than 0.
- `j` will be `c` after the loop completes.
- `i` must still be less than `r` (this condition is independent of the loop).
- `s` will be the concatenated string of `str(l[i][j]) + ' '` for all `j` from `0` to `c - 1`.

### Output State
Output State: **`c` is greater than 0, `j` is `c`, `i` must be less than `r`, `s` is the concatenation of `str(l[i][j]) + ' '` for all `j` from `0` to `c - 1`.**
