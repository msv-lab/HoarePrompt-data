`s` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `l[i][j]` with a space. However, since the initial state does not specify the values of `s`, `l`, `i`, or `j`, we can only state that `s` is updated by adding the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space. The values of `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is updated to include the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space, `l` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `j` is unchanged.**
