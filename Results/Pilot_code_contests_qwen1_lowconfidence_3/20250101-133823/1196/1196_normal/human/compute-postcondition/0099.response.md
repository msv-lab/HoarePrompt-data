Output State: **`s` is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements `l[i][j]` for `i` in the range `0` to `r-1` and `j` in the range `0` to `c-1`, separated by spaces, `r` is a positive integer, `c` is a positive integer, `i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `c - 1`, and the loop prints `s` for each column.**
