`s` is concatenated with the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space. Since the exact values of `l`, `i`, and `j` are not provided, the output state will include the updated value of `s` based on these unknowns.

Output State: **`s` is the original value of `s` (which is '') plus the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space, `r` must be greater than 0**
