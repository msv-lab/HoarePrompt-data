`s` is updated by adding `str(l[i][j]) + ' '` to its current value. Given the initial conditions, `c` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `c`, `i` must be less than `r`, and `s` is updated by adding `str(l[i][j]) + ' '` to its original value. Since `j` is equal to `c`, the value added to `s` is `str(l[i][c]) + ' '`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 0, `j` is `c`, `i` must be less than `r`, `s` is updated by adding `str(l[i][c]) + ' '` to its original value**
