`r` and `c` are swapped, so the new value of `r` will be the previous value of `c`, and the new value of `c` will be the previous value of `r`. The `flag` remains `True`.

Output State: **`r` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive); `c` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) and is now the previous value of `r`; `flag` is True**
