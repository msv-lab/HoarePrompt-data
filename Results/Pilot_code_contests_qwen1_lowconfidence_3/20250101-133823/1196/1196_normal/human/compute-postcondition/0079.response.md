According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` ranging from `0` to `c-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `s` is the concatenation of the string representations of `l[i][j]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `r-1` followed by `r` spaces.
- `r` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `r`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to update the state as follows:
1. Increment `j` by 1 since the current value of `j` would be `c-1` at the end of the previous iteration.
2. Ensure that `j` is still within the range of `0` to `c-1`. Since `j` is incremented by 1, it will be `c` if it was `c-1` before. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `c` should be greater than 0 (which is already true as `c` is a valid range parameter).

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

State: **`s` is the concatenation of the string representations of `l[i][j]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `r-1` followed by `r` spaces, `c` must be greater than 0, `i` is `r`, `j` is `c`**.
