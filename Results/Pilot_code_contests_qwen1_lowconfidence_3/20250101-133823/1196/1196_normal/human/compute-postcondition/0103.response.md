Functionality: **The function reads two integers \( r \) and \( c \) from standard input, representing the number of rows and columns respectively. It then creates a 2D list \( l \) of size \( r \times c \) filled with ones. A list \( b \) is also created containing integers from 1 to \( r + c \). Based on whether \( c \) is 1, it either keeps the original dimensions and prints the matrix column-wise, or swaps \( r \) and \( c \) and prints the matrix row-wise. If \( r = 1 \) and \( c = 1 \), it prints 0. After these operations, the function prints the matrix in the specified format and exits.**

This function handles the following edge cases:
- If both \( r \) and \( c \) are 1, it prints 0.
- If \( c \) is 1, it swaps \( r \) and \( c \) and prints the matrix column-wise.
- In all other cases, it prints the matrix row-wise.
