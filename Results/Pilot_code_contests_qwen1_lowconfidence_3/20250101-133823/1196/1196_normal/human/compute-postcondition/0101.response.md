Postcondition: ***`r` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `c` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive). If `r == 1` and `c == 1`, the printed value is 0. Otherwise, `s` is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements `l[i][j]` for `i` in the range `0` to `r-1` and `j` in the range `0` to `c-1`, separated by spaces. If `flag` is `False`, then `s` is printed for each column. If `flag` is `True`, no specific action is taken for `s`.***
