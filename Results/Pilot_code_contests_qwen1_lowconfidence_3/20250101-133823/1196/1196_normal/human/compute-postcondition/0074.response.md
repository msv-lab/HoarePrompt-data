`s` is updated by appending the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space to its current value. The values of `r` and the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the original value of `s` plus the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space.

Output State: **`s` is the original value of `s` plus the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space, `r` must be greater than 0**
