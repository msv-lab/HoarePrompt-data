According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `c`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:

- `c` is greater than 0
- `s` is an empty string plus the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space
- `j` is 0
- `i` must be less than `r`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `c`. Since `j` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it needs to be incremented to 1 for the loop to continue.

Thus, the new state will be:

- `c` is still greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `s` remains the same since the string concatenation only happens within the loop body, and we don't know the exact value of `l[i][1]` yet
- `j` is now 1
- `i` must still be less than `r` (unchanged)

State: **`c` is greater than 0, `s` is an empty string plus the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space, `j` is 1, `i` must be less than `r`**
