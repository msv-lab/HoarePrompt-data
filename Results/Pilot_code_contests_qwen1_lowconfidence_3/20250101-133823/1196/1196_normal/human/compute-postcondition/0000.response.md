The code reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `r` and `c`. Since the input values are not specified in the initial state, we represent them as generic integers within the given range.

Output State: **`r` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `c` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive)`**
