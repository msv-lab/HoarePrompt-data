According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `r`. The loop will execute if `r` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `s` is an empty string (`''`). This does not ensure that the loop will execute, so we need to adjust the state to include `r` being greater than 0.

State: **`s` is '', `r` must be greater than 0**
