`s` is updated by appending the string representation of `l[i][j]` (where `i` is `2r` and `j` is `c`) followed by a space. The value of `r` and `c` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `s` will be the original value of `s` concatenated with the string representation of `l[2r][c]` followed by a space.

Output State: **`s` is the string representation of `l[2r][c]` followed by a space, `r` is a positive integer, `i` is 2r, `j` is `c`, `c` is greater than 0**
