According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `r`. If `i` is less than `r`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is the original value of `s` plus the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space.
- `r` must be greater than 0.

Since the loop iterates over `i` in the range from 0 to `r-1`, at the end of the last iteration, `i` would be `r-1` and `r` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `r`, and `r` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`s` is the original value of `s` plus the string representation of `l[r-1][j]` followed by a space, `r` must be greater than 0**
