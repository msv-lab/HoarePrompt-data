`s` is updated by appending the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space to its current value. The value of `r` remains greater than 0, and `i` remains equal to `r`. The initial state of `s` is the original value plus the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space.

Output State: **`s` is the original value of `s` plus the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space; `r` must be greater than 0; `i` is `r`**
