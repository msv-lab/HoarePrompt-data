`s` is assigned the value of `s + str(l[i][j]) + ' '`. The value of `s` is unknown initially, but it is updated by adding `str(l[i][j]) + ' '` to its current value. The values of `c`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is greater than 0, `j` is `c-1`, `i` must be less than `r`, and `s` is updated by adding `str(l[i][j]) + ' '` to its original value.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 0, `j` is `c-1`, `i` must be less than `r`, and `s` is updated by adding `str(l[i][j]) + ' '` to its original value**
