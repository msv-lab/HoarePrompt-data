Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 1
   - `c` is at least 1
   - `r` is greater than 0
   - `flag` is either `True` or `False` based on the initial value of `c`
   - `l` is a 2D list of dimensions `r x c` where each element `l[i][j]` is \((b[i] * b[r + j])^{c+2}\)
   - `b` is a list containing integers from 1 to `r + c`
   - `i` is `i_current + 1` where `i_current < r - 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` in the range `range(c)`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts with `j = 0` and goes up to `j = c-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration Check:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within the range `0` to `c-1`.
   - Since `j` is currently 1, it needs to be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, the loop can execute again if `j` is incremented to 2 and still within the range.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - `j` needs to be 2 for the next iteration.
   - `c`, `r`, `flag`, `l`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop incrementing `j`.

Given this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`j` is 2, `c` is at least 1, `r` is greater than 0, `flag` is either `True` or `False` based on the initial value of `c`, `l` is a 2D list of dimensions `r x c` where each element `l[i][j]` is \((b[i] * b[r + j])^{c+2}\), `b` is a list containing integers from 1 to `r + c`, `i` is `i_current + 1` where `i_current < r - 1.**
