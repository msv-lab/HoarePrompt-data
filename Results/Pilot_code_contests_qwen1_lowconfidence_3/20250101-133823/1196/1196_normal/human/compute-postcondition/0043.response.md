According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `c`. The loop runs as long as `j` is less than `c`. At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is greater than 0, and `s` is updated by appending the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space.

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `j` must be incremented by 1.
2. After incrementing, `j` must still be less than `c`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote it as `j_prev`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j_prev + 1` must be less than `c`.

Therefore, the new state should reflect that `j` is now `j_prev + 1`, and `s` is updated by appending the string representation of `l[i][j_prev + 1]` followed by a space.

State: **`c` is greater than 0, `s` is updated by appending the string representation of `l[i][j+1]` followed by a space**
