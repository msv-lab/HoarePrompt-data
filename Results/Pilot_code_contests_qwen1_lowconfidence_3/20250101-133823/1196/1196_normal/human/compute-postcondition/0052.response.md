`s` is updated by adding the string representation of `l[i][j]` and a space. Given the initial state, `j` is 1 and `i` must be less than `r`. Since no specific values for `l[i][j]` or `r` are provided, we cannot specify the exact content of `s`, but we know it has been appended to.

The value of `j` remains unchanged, and `i` remains within its constraint (less than `r`). The value of `c` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 0, `s` is an empty string plus the string representation of `l[i][1]` followed by a space, `j` is 1, `i` must be less than `r`**
