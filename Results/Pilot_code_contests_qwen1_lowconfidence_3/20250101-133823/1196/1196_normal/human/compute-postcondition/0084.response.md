`s` is updated by appending `str(l[i][j]) + ' '` to its current value. Initially, `s` is an empty string plus a single character from `l[r][c]` followed by a space. Since `i` is `r + 1` and `j` is `c`, the value added to `s` is `str(l[r+1][c]) + ' '`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an empty string plus a single character from `l[r][c]` followed by a space, plus `str(l[r+1][c]) + ' '`, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is `r + 1`, `j` is `c`, `r` must be greater than 0**
