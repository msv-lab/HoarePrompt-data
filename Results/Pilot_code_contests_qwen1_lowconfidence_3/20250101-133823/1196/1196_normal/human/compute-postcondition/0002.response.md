The code `print(0)` prints the value `0` to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `r` and `c`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`r` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `c` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive); printed value is 0**
