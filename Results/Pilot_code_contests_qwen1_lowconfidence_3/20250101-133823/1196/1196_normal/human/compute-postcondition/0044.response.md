`s` is assigned the value of itself plus the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space. The value of `c` remains greater than 0, but the specific value of `c` is not relevant to the change in `s`. The value of `s` is updated based on the current value of `l[i][j]`.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 0, `s` is updated by appending the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space**
