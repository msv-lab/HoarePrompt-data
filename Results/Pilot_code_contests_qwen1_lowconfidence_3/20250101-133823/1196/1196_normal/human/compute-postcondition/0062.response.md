`s` is assigned the value of `s + str(l[i][j]) + ' '`. The value of `l[i][j]` is not specified, so it remains as `l[i][j]`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`c` is greater than 0, `j` is `c`, `i` must be less than `r`, `s` is updated by adding `str(l[i][j]) + ' '` to its original value**
