`s` is updated by appending the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space. However, the initial values of `s`, `l`, `i`, and `j` are not provided. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of these variables, we can only say that `s` has been updated.

Output State: **`c` must be greater than 0, `s` has been updated by appending the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space**
