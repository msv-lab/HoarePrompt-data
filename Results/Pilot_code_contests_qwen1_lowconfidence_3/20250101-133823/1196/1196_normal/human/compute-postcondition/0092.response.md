`s` is concatenated with the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space. The values of `i` and `j` are `2r - 1` and `c` respectively, and both `r` and `c` are greater than 0. Since `s` was initially an empty string, the new value of `s` will be the string representation of `l[2r - 1][c]` followed by a space. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is the string representation of `l[2r - 1][c]` followed by a space, `r` must be a positive integer, `i` is `2r - 1`, `j` is `c`, `c` is greater than 0**
