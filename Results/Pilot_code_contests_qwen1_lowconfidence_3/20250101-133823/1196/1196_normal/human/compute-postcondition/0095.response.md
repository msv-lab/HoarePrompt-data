Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `s` is the string representation of `l[2r][c]` followed by a space.
   - `r` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is `2r`.
   - `j` is `c`.
   - `c` is greater than 0.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition for the given for loop is `i in range(r)`. This means the loop iterates from `0` to `r-1`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was equal to `2r`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be less than `r`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `i` was `2r` and it needs to be less than `r` for the loop to continue, this indicates that `2r` must be within the range of `range(r)`, which is impossible unless `r` is 0 or negative. However, since `r` is stated as a positive integer, this scenario is not possible based on the given constraints.
   - Given the constraints, the only logical conclusion is that the loop has already completed all its iterations, and `i` has exceeded `r`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the loop cannot continue with the current values, no adjustments to the states are needed because the loop has already finished.

However, if we assume there was a mistake and the loop is supposed to run properly, then we would need to adjust the state as follows:
   - The value of `i` should be incremented by 1 (from `2r` to `2r + 1`), but since `i` needs to be less than `r`, this is not feasible.
   - Therefore, the loop cannot execute again with the given conditions.

Given the constraints, the correct state at the start of the next iteration does not exist because the loop has already completed.

State: **No adjustment needed as the loop has already completed.**
