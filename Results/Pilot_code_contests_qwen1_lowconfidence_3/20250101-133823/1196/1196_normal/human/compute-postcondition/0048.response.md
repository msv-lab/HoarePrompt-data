`s` is assigned an empty string, which means the current value of `s` is lost. The variables `c`, `i`, and `r` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` must be at least 1, `s` is an empty string, and `i` must be less than `r`.

Output State: **`c` must be at least 1, `s` is an empty string, and `i` must be less than `r`.**
