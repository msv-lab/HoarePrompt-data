According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `r`. If `i` is less than `r`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were true:
- `s` is an empty string plus a single character from `l[i][j]` followed by a space
- `c` is greater than 0
- `i` is `r`
- `j` is `c`
- `r` must be greater than 0

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Since `i` was equal to `r` at the end of the previous iteration, it needs to become `r + 1`. Additionally, for the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `r`.

Given that `r` must be greater than 0 and assuming no changes to `r`, the only variable that changes is `i`. Therefore, `i` becomes `r + 1`.

State: **`s` is an empty string plus a single character from `l[r][c]` followed by a space, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is `r + 1`, `j` is `c`, `r` must be greater than 0**
