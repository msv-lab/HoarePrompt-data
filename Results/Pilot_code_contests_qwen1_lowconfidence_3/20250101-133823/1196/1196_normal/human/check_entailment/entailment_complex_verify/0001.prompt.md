You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let a be a matrix of size r × c containing positive integers, not necessarily distinct. Rows of the matrix are numbered from 1 to r, columns are numbered from 1 to c. We can construct an array b consisting of r + c integers as follows: for each i ∈ [1, r], let b_i be the greatest common divisor of integers in the i-th row, and for each j ∈ [1, c] let b_{r+j} be the greatest common divisor of integers in the j-th column. 

We call the matrix diverse if all r + c numbers b_k (k ∈ [1, r + c]) are pairwise distinct. 

The magnitude of a matrix equals to the maximum of b_k.

For example, suppose we have the following matrix:

\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 9 & 7\\\ 4 & 144 & 84 \end{pmatrix} 

We construct the array b:

  1. b_1 is the greatest common divisor of 2, 9, and 7, that is 1; 
  2. b_2 is the greatest common divisor of 4, 144, and 84, that is 4; 
  3. b_3 is the greatest common divisor of 2 and 4, that is 2; 
  4. b_4 is the greatest common divisor of 9 and 144, that is 9; 
  5. b_5 is the greatest common divisor of 7 and 84, that is 7. 



So b = [1, 4, 2, 9, 7]. All values in this array are distinct, so the matrix is diverse. The magnitude is equal to 9.

For a given r and c, find a diverse matrix that minimises the magnitude. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them. If there are no solutions, output a single integer 0. 

Input

The only line in the input contains two space separated integers r and c (1 ≤ r,c ≤ 500) — the number of rows and the number of columns of the matrix to be found.

Output

If there is no solution, output a single integer 0.

Otherwise, output r rows. The i-th of them should contain c space-separated integers, the j-th of which is a_{i,j} — the positive integer in the i-th row and j-th column of a diverse matrix minimizing the magnitude.

Furthermore, it must hold that 1 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^9. It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is also a solution with this additional constraint (still having minimum possible magnitude).

Examples

Input


2 2


Output


4 12
2 9

Input


1 1


Output


0

Note

In the first example, the GCDs of rows are b_1 = 4 and b_2 = 1, and the GCDs of columns are b_3 = 2 and b_4 = 3. All GCDs are pairwise distinct and the maximum of them is 4. Since the GCDs have to be distinct and at least 1, it is clear that there are no diverse matrices of size 2 × 2 with magnitude smaller than 4.

In the second example, no matter what a_{1,1} is, b_1 = b_2 will always hold, so there are no diverse matrices.
Program:
```
def func():
    (r, c) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if r == 1 and c == 1:
        print(0)
    else:
        flag = False
        if c == 1:
            flag = True
            (r, c) = (c, r)
        l = [[1 for _ in range(c)] for _ in range(r)]
        b = [i + 1 for i in range(r + c)]
        for i in range(r):
            for j in range(c):
                l[i][j] *= b[i] * b[r + j]
        if flag == False:
            for i in range(r):
                s = ''
                for j in range(c):
                    s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '
                print(s)
        else:
            for j in range(c):
                s = ''
                for i in range(r):
                    s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '
                print(s)

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `r` and `c` are both greater than 1. According to the problem description, the goal is to construct a matrix such that the GCDs of the rows and columns are pairwise distinct and the magnitude is minimized. However, the program generates a matrix where all elements are the product of the corresponding GCDs, which does not guarantee that the GCDs will be distinct.

For example, consider the input `(2, 2)`:
- The program outputs:
```
4 12
2 9
```
- The GCDs of the rows are:
  - Row 1: GCD(4, 12) = 4
  - Row 2: GCD(2, 9) = 1
- The GCDs of the columns are:
  - Column 1: GCD(4, 2) = 2
  - Column 2: GCD(12, 9) = 3
- The array `b` is `[4, 2, 1, 3]`, which are indeed distinct.

However, another valid solution could be:
```
2 6
4 3
```
- The GCDs of the rows are:
  - Row 1: GCD(2, 6) = 2
  - Row 2: GCD(4, 3) = 1
- The GCDs of the columns are:
  - Column 1: GCD(2, 4) = 2
  - Column 2: GCD(6, 3) = 3
- The array `b` is `[2, 2, 1, 3]`, which is not distinct because the GCD of the first row is 2, and the GCD of the first column is also 2.

Since the program does not ensure that the GCDs are distinct, it fails to meet the problem requirements in some cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Otherwise, the values of `r`, `c`, and `flag` remain unchanged.

        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `r` is a positive integer, `c` is a positive integer, `flag` is either `True` or `False` based on the initial value of `c`, `l` is a 2D list of dimensions `r x c` where each element `l[i][j]` is \((b[i] \times b[r + j])^{rc}\), `b` is a list containing integers from 1 to `r + c`.

        else :
            for j in range(c):
                s = ''
                
                for i in range(r):
                    s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '

            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements `l[i][j]` for `i` in the range `0` to `r-1` and `j` in the range `0` to `c-1`, separated by spaces, `r` is a positive integer, `c` is a positive integer, `i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `c - 1`, and the loop prints `s` for each column.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements `l[i][j]` for `i` in the range `0` to `r-1` and `j` in the range `0` to `c-1`, separated by spaces. If `flag` is `False`, then `s` is printed for each column. If `flag` is `True`, no specific action is taken for `s`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`r` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `c` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive). If `r == 1` and `c == 1`, the printed value is 0. Otherwise, `s` is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements `l[i][j]` for `i` in the range `0` to `r-1` and `j` in the range `0` to `c-1`, separated by spaces. If `flag` is `False`, then `s` is printed for each column. If `flag` is `True`, no specific action is taken for `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers \( r \) and \( c \) from standard input, representing the number of rows and columns respectively. It then creates a 2D list \( l \) of size \( r \times c \) filled with ones. A list \( b \) is also created containing integers from 1 to \( r + c \). Based on whether \( c \) is 1, it either keeps the original dimensions and prints the matrix column-wise, or swaps \( r \) and \( c \) and prints the matrix row-wise. If \( r = 1 \) and \( c = 1 \), it prints 0. After these operations, the function prints the matrix in the specified format and exits.
