Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `r` and `c` are both greater than 1. According to the problem description, the goal is to construct a matrix such that the GCDs of the rows and columns are pairwise distinct and the magnitude is minimized. However, the program generates a matrix where all elements are the product of the corresponding GCDs, which does not guarantee that the GCDs will be distinct.

For example, consider the input `(2, 2)`:
- The program outputs:
```
4 12
2 9
```
- The GCDs of the rows are:
  - Row 1: GCD(4, 12) = 4
  - Row 2: GCD(2, 9) = 1
- The GCDs of the columns are:
  - Column 1: GCD(4, 2) = 2
  - Column 2: GCD(12, 9) = 3
- The array `b` is `[4, 2, 1, 3]`, which are indeed distinct.

However, another valid solution could be:
```
2 6
4 3
```
- The GCDs of the rows are:
  - Row 1: GCD(2, 6) = 2
  - Row 2: GCD(4, 3) = 1
- The GCDs of the columns are:
  - Column 1: GCD(2, 4) = 2
  - Column 2: GCD(6, 3) = 3
- The array `b` is `[2, 2, 1, 3]`, which is not distinct because the GCD of the first row is 2, and the GCD of the first column is also 2.

Since the program does not ensure that the GCDs are distinct, it fails to meet the problem requirements in some cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
