Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `r` or `c` is 1 correctly. According to the problem description, if `r` or `c` is 1, no diverse matrix exists, and the program should output `0`. However, the program only checks for the case when both `r` and `c` are 1 and outputs `0`. For other cases where either `r` or `c` is 1, the program incorrectly constructs a matrix.

For example, if the input is `(1, 2)`, the program should output `0` because no diverse matrix exists for a 1x2 matrix. However, the program constructs a matrix and outputs it, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case where either `r` or `c` is 1 separately and output `0` without constructing a matrix.
