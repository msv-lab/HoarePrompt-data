You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let a be a matrix of size r × c containing positive integers, not necessarily distinct. Rows of the matrix are numbered from 1 to r, columns are numbered from 1 to c. We can construct an array b consisting of r + c integers as follows: for each i ∈ [1, r], let b_i be the greatest common divisor of integers in the i-th row, and for each j ∈ [1, c] let b_{r+j} be the greatest common divisor of integers in the j-th column. 

We call the matrix diverse if all r + c numbers b_k (k ∈ [1, r + c]) are pairwise distinct. 

The magnitude of a matrix equals to the maximum of b_k.

For example, suppose we have the following matrix:

\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 9 & 7\\\ 4 & 144 & 84 \end{pmatrix} 

We construct the array b:

  1. b_1 is the greatest common divisor of 2, 9, and 7, that is 1; 
  2. b_2 is the greatest common divisor of 4, 144, and 84, that is 4; 
  3. b_3 is the greatest common divisor of 2 and 4, that is 2; 
  4. b_4 is the greatest common divisor of 9 and 144, that is 9; 
  5. b_5 is the greatest common divisor of 7 and 84, that is 7. 



So b = [1, 4, 2, 9, 7]. All values in this array are distinct, so the matrix is diverse. The magnitude is equal to 9.

For a given r and c, find a diverse matrix that minimises the magnitude. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them. If there are no solutions, output a single integer 0. 

Input

The only line in the input contains two space separated integers r and c (1 ≤ r,c ≤ 500) — the number of rows and the number of columns of the matrix to be found.

Output

If there is no solution, output a single integer 0.

Otherwise, output r rows. The i-th of them should contain c space-separated integers, the j-th of which is a_{i,j} — the positive integer in the i-th row and j-th column of a diverse matrix minimizing the magnitude.

Furthermore, it must hold that 1 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^9. It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is also a solution with this additional constraint (still having minimum possible magnitude).

Examples

Input


2 2


Output


4 12
2 9

Input


1 1


Output


0

Note

In the first example, the GCDs of rows are b_1 = 4 and b_2 = 1, and the GCDs of columns are b_3 = 2 and b_4 = 3. All GCDs are pairwise distinct and the maximum of them is 4. Since the GCDs have to be distinct and at least 1, it is clear that there are no diverse matrices of size 2 × 2 with magnitude smaller than 4.

In the second example, no matter what a_{1,1} is, b_1 = b_2 will always hold, so there are no diverse matrices.
Program:
```
def func():
    (r, c) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if r == 1 and c == 1:
        print(0)
    else:
        flag = False
        if c == 1:
            flag = True
            (r, c) = (c, r)
        l = [[1 for _ in range(c)] for _ in range(r)]
        b = [i + 1 for i in range(r + c)]
        for i in range(r):
            for j in range(c):
                l[i][j] *= b[i] * b[r + j]
        if flag == False:
            for i in range(r):
                s = ''
                for j in range(c):
                    s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '
                print(s)
        else:
            for j in range(c):
                s = ''
                for i in range(r):
                    s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '
                print(s)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
