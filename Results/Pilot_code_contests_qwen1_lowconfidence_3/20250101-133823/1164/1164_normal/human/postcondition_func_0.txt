The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `p`, where both `n` and `p` are integers greater than 1. It computes `n` raised to the power of `(p-2)` modulo `p` and returns the result. This computation is based on modular arithmetic and is often used in scenarios such as finding modular inverses. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly within its body; however, it assumes that `p` is greater than 1 and `n` is also greater than 1. If `p` were equal to 1, the expression `p - 2` would result in an invalid value, and if `n` were 1, the result would always be 1 regardless of `p`. The function does not perform any additional checks or handling for these cases.
