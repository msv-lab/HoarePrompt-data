The function `func_3()` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers derived from a single line of space-separated integers obtained from the function `func_4()`. After executing the function, the program state will be characterized by the return value being a list of integers. No additional actions are performed by `func_3()` beyond converting the string returned by `func_4()` into a list of integers. An edge case to consider is if `func_4()` returns an empty string, resulting in an empty list being returned by `func_3()`. There is no missing functionality noted within the provided code; however, it is assumed that `func_4()` correctly handles its own potential edge cases.
