#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1, and p is an integer greater than 1.
def func_1(n, p):
    return pow(n, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns n raised to the power of (p-2) modulo p
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `p`, where both `n` and `p` are integers greater than 1. It computes `n` raised to the power of `(p-2)` modulo `p` and returns the result. This computation is based on modular arithmetic and is often used in scenarios such as finding modular inverses. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly within its body; however, it assumes that `p` is greater than 1 and `n` is also greater than 1. If `p` were equal to 1, the expression `p - 2` would result in an invalid value, and if `n` were 1, the result would always be 1 regardless of `p`. The function does not perform any additional checks or handling for these cases.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2():
    return map(int, func_4().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers converted from the split string returned by func_4()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and returns a map object containing integers. These integers are derived from a string that is split using the `split()` method on the result of calling `func_4()`. The function assumes that `func_4()` returns a string which, when split, can be converted to integers. If `func_4()` returns an empty string or a string with no valid integers, the resulting map object will be empty. There is no handling for non-integer values in the split string, so such cases would result in a `ValueError` during the conversion process.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are provided, but based on the context, `func_4()` returns a single line of space-separated integers representing the sequence `a`, and the subsequent operations are performed based on the values of `n` and `q` derived from this sequence.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_4().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers derived from a single line of space-separated integers obtained from `func_4()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers derived from a single line of space-separated integers obtained from the function `func_4()`. After executing the function, the program state will be characterized by the return value being a list of integers. No additional actions are performed by `func_3()` beyond converting the string returned by `func_4()` into a list of integers. An edge case to consider is if `func_4()` returns an empty string, resulting in an empty list being returned by `func_3()`. There is no missing functionality noted within the provided code; however, it is assumed that `func_4()` correctly handles its own potential edge cases.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_4()` are provided or utilized, hence no specific precondition can be extracted based on the function signature alone. However, the function is expected to read input from the standard input.
def func_4():
    return input()
    #The program returns user input from standard input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` reads a line of input from the standard input (e.g., keyboard) and returns it. There are no parameters required for this function. This function will block until input is received from the standard input. If no input is provided, the function will still return whatever input is eventually given. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it's important to note that the function does not provide any validation or error handling for the input it receives.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are provided, and the function does not take any parameters. However, it reads input from stdin, so the input consists of an integer n on the first line, followed by n integers on the second line, and then q integers on the third line, where q is the number of changes. Each change is described by three integers l, r, and x.
def func_5():
    return int(input())
    #The program reads an integer n from stdin, followed by n integers, then q integers which represent changes, and returns the first integer entered by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` from stdin, followed by `n` integers, and then `q` integers which represent changes. It returns the first integer entered by the user. The function does not process the subsequent integers or changes; it simply discards them after reading them. An edge case is that if no input is provided (e.g., the user inputs nothing and immediately presses enter), the function will still read and return the first integer entered by the user, which might be unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function does not validate the input, so non-integer inputs could lead to undefined behavior.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9 and -10^9 ≤ y ≤ 10^9.
def func_6(x, y):
    x = abs(x)
    y = abs(y)
    if (min(x, y) == 0) :
        return max(x, y)
        #`The program returns the maximum of x and y`
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq y \leq 10^9\), and \( \min(x, y) \neq 0 \)
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y, and y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two integers `x` and `y` such that -10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9 and -10^9 ≤ y ≤ 10^9. It first converts both `x` and `y` to their absolute values. Then, it checks if the minimum of `x` and `y` is zero. If it is, the function returns the maximum of `x` and `y`. Otherwise, it uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the loop, the function returns the GCD of `x` and `y` as `x` and `y` as 0. 

In summary, the function either returns the maximum of `x` and `y` or the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y` with `y` set to 0. This covers all potential cases where the minimum of `x` and `y` can be either zero or non-zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n.
def func_7(n):
    l = []
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)):
        if n % i == 0:
            if n // i == i:
                l.append(i)
            else:
                l.append(i)
                l.append(n // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `l` is a list containing all unique pairs of divisors `(i, n // i)` such that `i` ranges from `1` to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.
    return l
    #The program returns a list 'l' containing all unique pairs of divisors (i, n // i) such that 'i' ranges from 1 to int(math.sqrt(n))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list `l` containing all unique pairs of divisors (i, n // i) such that `i` ranges from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(n))`. This means that for each divisor `i` of `n`, both `i` and `n // i` are included in the list `l`. The function ensures that each pair is only added once, even if `i` and `n // i` are the same (which happens when `n` is a perfect square). The function correctly handles the case where `n` is zero or one, returning an empty list or a single-element list `[1]` respectively.
