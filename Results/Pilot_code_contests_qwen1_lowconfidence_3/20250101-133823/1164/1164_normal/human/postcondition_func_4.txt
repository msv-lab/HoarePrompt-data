The function reads an integer `n` from stdin, followed by `n` integers, and then `q` integers which represent changes. It returns the first integer entered by the user. The function does not process the subsequent integers or changes; it simply discards them after reading them. An edge case is that if no input is provided (e.g., the user inputs nothing and immediately presses enter), the function will still read and return the first integer entered by the user, which might be unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function does not validate the input, so non-integer inputs could lead to undefined behavior.
