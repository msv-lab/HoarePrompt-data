The function `func_4()` reads a line of input from the standard input (e.g., keyboard) and returns it. There are no parameters required for this function. This function will block until input is received from the standard input. If no input is provided, the function will still return whatever input is eventually given. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it's important to note that the function does not provide any validation or error handling for the input it receives.
