The code appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Given the initial state, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and divisible by `i`, and the current value of `n` equals `i` squared. The list `l` is initially empty. After appending `i` to `l`, the list `l` will contain `[i]`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and divisible by `i`; the current value of `n` equals `i` squared; `l` is a list containing `[i]`.**
