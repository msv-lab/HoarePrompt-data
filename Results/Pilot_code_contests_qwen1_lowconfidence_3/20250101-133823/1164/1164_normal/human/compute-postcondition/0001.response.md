Let's break down the given task step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - The loop variable `i` is initialized in the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`.
   - The initial value of `n` is given as a non-negative integer (0 <= n).
   - The variable `l` is an empty list.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, the upper bound of the range function, `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`, must be greater than 1. This ensures there are iterations to execute the loop body.
   - If `math.sqrt(n)` results in 0 (when `n` is 0), then `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` would be 1, resulting in no iterations since the range would be from 1 to 1 (which is just one number, but the range is inclusive of the end).

3. **Adjust the State Based on the Above Conditions:**
   - Since the loop requires `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` to be greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 0.
   - When `n` is greater than 0, `math.sqrt(n)` will be a positive number, and adding 1 to it will result in a value greater than 1, ensuring the loop executes.

4. **Formulate the Final State:**
   - The state of `n` should be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute, which means `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The state of `l` remains as an empty list, which does not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, the final state needed for the loop to execute is:

**`n` must be greater than 0, `l` is an empty list**
