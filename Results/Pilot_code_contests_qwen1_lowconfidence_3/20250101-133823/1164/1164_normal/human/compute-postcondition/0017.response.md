First, let's analyze the initial state and the given code snippet:

- Initial State: `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2`, and `n` must be such that `1 <= int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2 <= int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

From this, we can deduce that `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2` must equal `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. This is only possible if `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2` equals `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, which implies that `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2` cannot actually be `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. Therefore, there seems to be a contradiction in the initial state. However, for the sake of the problem, we will assume that the initial state holds true and proceed with the logic.

The code snippet provided is:
```
l.append(i)
```

This line appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Since `i` is defined as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2`, the value of `i` will be added to `l`.

Given the initial state, let's determine the value of `i`:
- Let `int(math.sqrt(n)) = k`. According to the initial state, `k + 2` must equal `k + 1`, which is not possible unless we interpret it as a special case where `i` is set to a specific value that satisfies both conditions simultaneously. Given the logical contradiction, let's consider the closest valid interpretation, which would be setting `i` to a value that fits the boundary condition. In practice, `i` would be set to `k + 2` where `k` is an integer, and `i` would be a value that does not violate the condition.

Since `i` is being appended to `l`, and no other variables are affected, the output state is:
- `l` contains `[i]` where `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`l` contains `[int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2]`, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2`**
