The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. From the initial state, we know that `i` will be `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. This value is appended to `l`.

Therefore, the updated state includes the value of `i` being added to `l`.

Output State: **`l` contains `[int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1]`, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`**
