First, let's analyze the initial state and the given condition:

- `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2`.
- The condition `1 <= int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2 <= int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` implies that the only possible value for `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2` is 2 because there is no integer between 1 and 1 (inclusive).

Given this, we can deduce:
- `int(math.sqrt(n))` must be 0 because adding 2 to it results in 2.
- Therefore, `i` must be 2.

Next, let's look at the code snippet:
```
l.append(i)
```
This line appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Since `i` is 2, `l` will now contain the element 2.

The output state, considering the updated value of `i` and the new content of `l`, is:
Output State: **`i` is 2; `l` is [2]**
