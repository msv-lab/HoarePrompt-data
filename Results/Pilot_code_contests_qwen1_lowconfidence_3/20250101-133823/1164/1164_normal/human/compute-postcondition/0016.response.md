Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
   - If `n % i == 0` and `n // i == i`, then `l` includes the appended value `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `l` contains `[int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, n // (int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1)]` and `i` remains as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and should still be within the range up to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

4. **Incrementing `i`**: Since `i` was `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2`.

5. **Check if `i` is within Range**: We need to ensure that `i` is still within the range `1` to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. If `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2` is within this range, the loop can continue. However, typically, `i` would be incremented within the loop itself.

Given the standard behavior of such loops, let's assume the loop increments `i` inside its body and checks the condition again. If `i` exceeds `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, the loop would naturally terminate.

Therefore, the next state, if the loop were to execute one more time, would involve incrementing `i` by 1, but ensuring it does not exceed `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
- `i` will be `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2` (if `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2` is still within the range).
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `l` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

Since the exact condition for appending to `l` is not specified for the new `i`, we will keep the `l` state as it was, unless further conditions dictate otherwise.

State: **`i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2`, `n` must be such that `1 <= int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2 <= int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, and `l` remains unchanged.**

However, if `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2` exceeds the upper limit of the range, the loop will terminate. Therefore, the practical adjustment would be:

State: **`i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2`, and `n` must be such that `1 <= int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2 <= int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.**

If the condition is not met, the loop terminates. 

**Final State**:
- If `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2` is within the range: **`i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2`, `n` must be such that `1 <= int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2 <= int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, and `l` remains unchanged.**
- If `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2` exceeds the range: **The loop terminates.**
