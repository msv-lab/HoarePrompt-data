Functionality: **The function `func_7` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list `l` containing all unique pairs of divisors (i, n // i) such that `i` ranges from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(n))`. This means that for each divisor `i` of `n`, both `i` and `n // i` are included in the list `l`. The function ensures that each pair is only added once, even if `i` and `n // i` are the same (which happens when `n` is a perfect square). The function correctly handles the case where `n` is zero or one, returning an empty list or a single-element list `[1]` respectively.**

This summary covers the actual behavior of the function based on the code, including the handling of edge cases like `n = 0` and `n = 1`, and the correct generation of unique divisor pairs.
