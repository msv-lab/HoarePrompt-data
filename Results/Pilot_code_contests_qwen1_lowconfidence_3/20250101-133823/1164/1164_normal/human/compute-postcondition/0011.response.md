The given code snippet updates the list `l` by appending the value of `i`. The value of `i` is determined as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. This means that `l` will now include this new value of `i`.

Let's summarize the impact of the code:

1. The value of `i` is set to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
2. The value of `l` is updated by appending `i` to it.

The output state will be:

Output State: **`i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`; `l` includes the appended value `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`**
