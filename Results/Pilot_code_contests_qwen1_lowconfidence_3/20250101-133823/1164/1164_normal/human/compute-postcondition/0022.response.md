To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step:

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over values of `i` from `1` to `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` and checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If so, it appends `i` to the list `l`. If `n // i` is also equal to `i`, only one `i` is appended; otherwise, both `i` and `n // i` are appended.

### Key Observations
- The loop continues until `i` reaches `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`.
- For each `i` that divides `n`, `i` and possibly `n // i` are appended to `l`.

### Final State
After all iterations, the list `l` will contain all unique pairs of divisors `(i, n // i)` such that `i * (n // i) = n` and `i` ranges from `1` to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

#### Detailed Steps
1. **Initialization**: `n` is a non-negative integer, and `l` is an empty list.
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `i` from `1` to `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`, check if `n` is divisible by `i`.
   - If `n % i == 0` and `n // i == i`, append `i` to `l`.
   - Otherwise, append both `i` and `n // i` to `l`.

### Output State After All Iterations
- If `n` is `0`, the loop does not execute, and `l` remains an empty list.
- If `n` is a positive integer, `l` will contain all unique pairs of divisors `(i, n // i)` where `i` ranges from `1` to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

### Conclusion
The final output state after the loop completes is:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `l` is a list containing all unique pairs of divisors `(i, n // i)` such that `i` ranges from `1` to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.**

This ensures that all possible divisors are captured, including the square root when applicable, and the list contains no duplicates.
