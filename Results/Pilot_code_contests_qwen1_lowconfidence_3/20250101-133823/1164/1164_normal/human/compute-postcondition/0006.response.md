`l` is appended with the value of `i`. The value of `i` is such that `n` is divisible by `i`, and `n` is not equal to \(i^2\). The value of `n` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it. Therefore, the updated state is that `l` now contains `i`.

Output State: **`n` is divisible by `i` and not equal to \(i^2\); `l` is `[i]`**
