Let's go through the steps:

1. **Initial State**: `l` contains `[int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1]`, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
2. **Code Execution**: `l.append(n // i)`

   - The value of `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is already known from the initial state and is stored in `i`.
   - The list `l` initially contains `[int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1]`.
   - The value of `n // i` is calculated and appended to `l`.

Since `i` is defined as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, the expression `n // i` will be evaluated with these values. However, the exact value of `n` is not specified, so let's denote `k = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. Thus, `i = k` and `n // i = n // (int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1)`.

Therefore, after executing `l.append(n // i)`, the list `l` will contain both `[k]` and `n // (int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1)`.

Output State: **`l` contains `[int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, n // (int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1)]`, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`**
