`l.append(n // i)` appends the value of `n // i` to the list `l`. Given that `l` is initially `[i]`, the updated list `l` will be `[i, n // i]`.

The value of `n` is still divisible by `i` and not equal to \(i^2\), which means those conditions remain true.

Output State: **`n` is divisible by `i` and not equal to \(i^2\); `l` is `[i, n // i]`**
