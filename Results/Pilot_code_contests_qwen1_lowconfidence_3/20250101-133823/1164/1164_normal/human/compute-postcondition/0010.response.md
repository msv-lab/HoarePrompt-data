Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list containing either `[i]` if `n` is divisible by `i` and `n` equals `i` squared, or `[i, n // i]` otherwise.

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` (inclusive).

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and we need to check if `i` is within the range of `1` to `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`.
   - Since the loop has just finished one iteration, `i` is currently `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue if `i` is less than `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

5. **Update the State:**
   - After incrementing `i`, the new value of `i` will be `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
   - We need to ensure that `l` is updated based on the new value of `i` and the condition specified in the problem.

Given the above analysis, let's formulate the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` will be `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
- The condition for updating `l` still holds based on the values of `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list containing either `[i]` if `n` is divisible by `i` and `n` equals `i` squared, or `[i, n // i]` otherwise, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`**.
