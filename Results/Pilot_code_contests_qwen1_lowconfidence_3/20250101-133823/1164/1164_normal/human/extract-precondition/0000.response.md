The provided function `func_8` does not seem to be related to the problem description. Instead, it appears to be a function that finds all prime numbers up to `n`. This function does not use or relate to the variables in the main problem description, so it cannot contribute to solving the described problem.

Given the problem description and the variables in the main function, let's extract the precondition.

### Problem Description
You are given a sequence of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \).

You need to construct two sequences \( b \) and \( c \) with length \( n \) that satisfy:
- For every \( i \) (\( 1 \le i \le n \)), \( b_i + c_i = a_i \).
- \( b \) is non-decreasing, meaning that for every \( 1 < i \le n \), \( b_i \ge b_{i-1} \) must hold.
- \( c \) is non-increasing, meaning that for every \( 1 < i \le n \), \( c_i \le c_{i-1} \) must hold.

You also need to minimize \( \max(b_i, c_i) \).

There will be \( q \) changes. The \( i \)-th change is described by three integers \( l, r, x \). You should add \( x \) to \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r \).

You need to find the minimum possible value of \( \max(b_i, c_i) \) for the initial sequence and for the sequence after each change.

### Input
- The first line contains an integer \( n \) (\( 1 \le n \le 10^5 \)).
- The second line contains \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) (\( 1 \le i \le n \), \( -10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 \)).
- The third line contains an integer \( q \) (\( 1 \le q \le 10^5 \)).
- Each of the next \( q \) lines contains three integers \( l, r, x \) (\( 1 \le l \le r \le n \), \( -10^9 \le x \le 10^9 \)), describing the next change.

### Output
- Print \( q+1 \) lines.
- On the \( i \)-th line (where \( 1 \le i \le q+1 \)), print the answer to the problem for the sequence after \( i-1 \) changes.

### Precondition
**Precondition:** **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \le n \le 10^5 \); `a` is a list of integers such that \( 1 \le i \le n \) and \( -10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 \); `q` is an integer such that \( 1 \le q \le 10^5 \); for each change described by \( l, r, x \), \( 1 \le l \le r \le n \) and \( -10^9 \le x \le 10^9 \).**
