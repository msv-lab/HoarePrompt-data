The code initializes a list `p` with `size` number of zeros. The value of `size` is `len(A)`, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the list `p` is created with `size` elements, all set to 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}), `A` is a map object of integers entered on the second line of input, `idx` is 0, `size` is len(A), `total` is size * (1 + size) / 2, `p` is a list of `size` zeros**
