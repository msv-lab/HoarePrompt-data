Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}), `A` is a map object of integers, `idx` is 0, `size` is `len(A)`, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` is a list of `size` zeros, `q` is a list of `size` zeros. If `A[0] > 0`, then `p[0]` is 1 and `q[0]` is 0. If `A[0] ≤ 0`, then `q[0]` is 1 and `p[0]` is 0.***
