To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given conditions and the loop statement.

### Given Conditions:
- `size` is at least 2.
- `A` is a list of integers.
- `p[i]` is either `p[i - 1] + 1` and greater than 0, or equal to `q[i - 1]`, depending on whether `A[i]` is greater than 0 or not.
- `q[i]` is either `q[i - 1]` or `q[i - 1] + 1`, based on the same condition.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, size):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Loop Condition**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `1` to `size - 1`.

2. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `1`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `2`.

4. **Conditions for Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is now `2`, we need to check if `i` is still within the valid range for the loop, which is `1` to `size - 1`.
   - Therefore, `size` must be at least `3` for the loop to continue.

5. **Updating States**:
   - `size` must be at least `3`.
   - `A` remains a list of integers.
   - `p[2]` is determined based on `p[1]` and `A[2]`:
     - If `A[2] > 0`, then `p[2] = p[1] + 1` and `p[2] > 0`.
     - Otherwise, `p[2] = q[1]`.
   - `q[2]` is determined based on `q[1]` and `A[2]`:
     - If `A[2] > 0`, then `q[2] = q[1] + 1`.
     - Otherwise, `q[2] = q[1]`.

### Final State:

- `size` must be at least `3`.
- `A` remains a list of integers.
- `p[2]` is determined as per the rules described.
- `q[2]` is determined as per the rules described.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`size` is at least 3, `A` is a list of integers, `p[2]` is either `p[1] + 1` and greater than 0, or equal to `q[1]`, depending on whether `A[2]` is greater than 0 or not, `q[2]` is either `q[1]` or `q[1] + 1`, based on the same condition**.
