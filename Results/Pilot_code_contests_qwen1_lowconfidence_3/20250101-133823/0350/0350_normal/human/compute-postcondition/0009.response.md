`p[0]` and `q[0]` are assigned the values `1` and `0`, respectively. This changes the values of `p` and `q` at index `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}), `A` is a map object of integers entered on the second line of input, `idx` is 0, `size` is `len(A)`, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` is a list of `size` zeros where `p[0]` is 1, `q` is a list of `size` zeros where `q[0]` is 0, `A[0]` is greater than 0**
