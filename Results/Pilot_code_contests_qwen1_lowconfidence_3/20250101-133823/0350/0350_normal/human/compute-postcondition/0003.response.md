The code `A = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and creates a map object from these integers. The variable `n` is an integer representing the number of elements that will be read from the next input line, but this input line itself is not read in this code. 

After executing the code, `A` becomes a map object containing the integers entered on the second line of input, and `n` remains as the integer entered on the first line of input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}), `A` is a map object of integers entered on the second line of input.**
