Postcondition: ***`size` is at least 3, `A` is a list of integers, `p[2]` is either `p[1] + 2` or `q[1]`, `q[2]` is either `q[1]` or `q[1] + 1`. If `A[i] > 0`, then `p[2]` is `p[1] + 2` and `q[2]` is `q[1]`. Otherwise, `p[2]` is `q[1]` and `q[2]` is `q[1] + 1` if `A[2]` is greater than 0, or `q[1]` if `A[2]` is not greater than 0.***
