`q[0]` is assigned the value `1`, and `p[0]` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}), `A` is a map object of integers entered on the second line of input, `idx` is 0, `size` is `len(A)`, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` is a list of `size` zeros, `q` is a list of `size` zeros, `A[0]` is less than or equal to 0, `q[0]` is 1, `p[0]` is 0**
