The code `n = int(raw_input())` reads an integer from the standard input and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that the input consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}), and the second line contains `n` integers. The raw_input function is used to read the first line.

After executing the code, the value of `n` is determined by the input provided on the first line, and the second line of input remains unread. The other information about the second line of input (the sequence of integers) is not yet processed or stored in a variable.

Output State: **`n` is the integer entered on the first line of input (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}); the second line of input consisting of `n` integers (-10^{9} ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9}; a_i ≠ 0) remains unread.**
