Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `size` is at least 3.
   - `A` is a list of integers.
   - `p[2]` is either `p[1] + 2` or `q[1]`.
   - `q[2]` is either `q[1]` or `q[1] + 1`.
   - If `A[i] > 0`, then `p[2]` is `p[1] + 2` and `q[2]` is `q[1]`.
   - Otherwise, `p[2]` is `q[1]` and `q[2]` is `q[1] + 1` if `A[2]` is greater than 0, or `q[1]` if `A[2]` is not greater than 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = size - 1`.

3. **What needs to be adjusted for the next iteration?**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was one value (let's say `i = k`).
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - Therefore, we need to determine the values of `p[2]` and `q[2]` based on the condition `A[k + 1] > 0`.

4. **Determine `p[2]` and `q[2]`:**
   - The value of `p[2]` depends on `A[k + 1] > 0`:
     - If `A[k + 1] > 0`, then `p[2] = p[1] + 2`.
     - Otherwise, `p[2] = q[1]`.
   - The value of `q[2]` depends on both `A[k + 1] > 0` and the value of `A[2]`:
     - If `A[k + 1] > 0`, then `q[2] = q[1]`.
     - If `A[k + 1] <= 0`, then `q[2] = q[1] + 1` if `A[2] > 0`, otherwise `q[2] = q[1]`.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - We need to ensure that `A` is still a list of integers and `size` remains at least 3.
   - `p[2]` and `q[2]` are adjusted based on the conditions mentioned above.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`size` is at least 3, `A` is a list of integers, `p[2]` is either `p[1] + 2` if `A[3] > 0` or `q[1]` otherwise, `q[2]` is either `q[1]` if `A[3] > 0` or `q[1] + 1` if `A[3] <= 0`.**
