`total` is assigned the value of `size * (1 + size) / 2`. The value of `size` is `len(A)`, which is the number of elements in the map object `A`. The initial state of `n` and `idx` is unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}), `A` is a map object of integers entered on the second line of input, `idx` is 0, `size` is len(A), `total` is size * (1 + size) / 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}), `A` is a map object of integers entered on the second line of input, `idx` is 0, `size` is len(A), `total` is size * (1 + size) / 2**
