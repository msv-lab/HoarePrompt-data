The code snippet `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)` sets the recursion limit to \(10^6\). This does not affect the values of the variables `n` or the sequence `a`. It only changes the recursion limit for the program. The values of `n` and the sequence `a` remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) representing the number of elements in the sequence, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^{9} ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9}; a_i ≠ 0) representing the elements of the sequence. The variable `input` now refers to `sys.stdin.readline`, and the recursion limit is set to \(10^6\).**
