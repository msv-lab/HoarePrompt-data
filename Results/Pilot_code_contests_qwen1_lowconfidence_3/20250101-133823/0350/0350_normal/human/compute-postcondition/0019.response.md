`q[i]` is assigned the value `p[i - 1] + 1`. The value of `p[i - 1]` is equal to `q[i - 1]`, so `q[i]` becomes `q[i - 1] + 1`. The conditions for `size` and `A[i]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`size` must be at least 2, `p[i]` is equal to `q[i - 1]`, `A[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `q[i]` is `q[i - 1] + 1`**
