The code `input = sys.stdin.readline` does not actually change any variable values or perform any operations that would alter the state. It simply reassigns the `input` variable to refer to `sys.stdin.readline`. This means that subsequent calls to `input()` will use `sys.stdin.readline` instead of the default behavior. However, since no actual input is being processed in this line, the values of `n` and the sequence `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) representing the number of elements in the sequence, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^{9} ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9}; a_i ≠ 0) representing the elements of the sequence. The variable `input` now refers to `sys.stdin.readline`**.
