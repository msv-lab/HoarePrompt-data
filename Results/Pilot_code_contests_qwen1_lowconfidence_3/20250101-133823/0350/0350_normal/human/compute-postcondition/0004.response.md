`idx` is assigned the value `0`, and `size` is assigned the length of the map object `A`. The initial value of `n` remains unchanged, and the map object `A` also remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}), `A` is a map object of integers entered on the second line of input, `idx` is 0, `size` is len(A)**
