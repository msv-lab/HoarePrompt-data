Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations.

### Initial State Recap:
- \( n \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \).
- \( A \) is a map object of integers.
- \( idx = 0 \).
- \( size = \text{len}(A) \).
- \( total = size \times (1 + size) / 2 \).
- \( p \) is a list of \( size \) zeros.
- \( q \) is a list of \( size \) zeros.
- If \( A[0] > 0 \), then \( p[0] = 1 \) and \( q[0] = 0 \). Otherwise, \( q[0] = 1 \) and \( p[0] = 0 \).

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over the range from 1 to \( size \). For each iteration \( i \):

- If \( A[i] > 0 \):
  - \( p[i] = p[i - 1] + 1 \)
  - \( q[i] = q[i - 1] \)
- If \( A[i] \leq 0 \):
  - \( p[i] = q[i - 1] \)
  - \( q[i] = p[i - 1] + 1 \)

### Final Values of \( p \) and \( q \):
We need to determine the final values of \( p \) and \( q \) after the loop completes all iterations.

1. **Understanding the Update Rules**:
   - If \( A[i] > 0 \), \( p[i] \) increments by 1.
   - If \( A[i] \leq 0 \), \( q[i] \) increments by 1.

2. **Final Values**:
   - \( p[i] \) will be the count of positive elements up to index \( i \) plus the initial value \( p[0] \).
   - \( q[i] \) will be the count of non-positive elements up to index \( i \) plus the initial value \( q[0] \).

Given the initial conditions:
- If \( A[0] > 0 \): \( p[0] = 1 \) and \( q[0] = 0 \).
- If \( A[0] \leq 0 \): \( p[0] = 0 \) and \( q[0] = 1 \).

### Final Output State:
After the loop executes, the final values of \( p \) and \( q \) will be determined by the counts of positive and non-positive elements in the list \( A \).

Output State: **`size` is the length of the list \( A \), `p[i]` is the count of positive elements in \( A \) up to index \( i \) plus the initial value \( p[0] \), and `q[i]` is the count of non-positive elements in \( A \) up to index \( i \) plus the initial value \( q[0] \).**

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`size` is the length of the list `A`, `p[i]` is the count of positive elements in `A` up to index `i` plus the initial value `p[0]`, and `q[i]` is the count of non-positive elements in `A` up to index `i` plus the initial value `q[0]`.**
