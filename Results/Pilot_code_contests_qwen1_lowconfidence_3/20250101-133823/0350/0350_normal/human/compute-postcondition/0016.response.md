The code `q[i] = q[i - 1]` assigns the value of `q[i - 1]` to `q[i]`. Since `p[i]` is defined as `p[i - 1] + 1` and `p[i - 1]` is greater than 0, `p[i]` must also be greater than 0. However, no information about `q` is given before this line of code, so we can only state that `q[i]` is assigned the value of `q[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`size` must be at least 2, `A` is a list of integers, `p[i]` is `p[i - 1] + 1` and is greater than 0, `q[i]` is equal to `q[i - 1]`**
