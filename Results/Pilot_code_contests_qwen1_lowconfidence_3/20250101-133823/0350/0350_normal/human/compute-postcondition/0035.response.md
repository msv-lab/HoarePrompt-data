The function `func` accepts a sequence of integers through two lines of input. The first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) representing the number of elements in the sequence, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (-10^{9} ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9}; a_i ≠ 0) representing the elements of the sequence.

Based on the given output cases, we need to consider the following:
- There are no direct parameters passed to the function, but the function processes the sequence of integers provided through standard input.
- The function does not return any explicit value directly from the function body, but rather its behavior is described by processing the sequence and handling it according to some logic (which is not detailed here).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a sequence of integers provided as input and handle it according to the specified conditions.

Functionality: **The function processes a sequence of integers provided through standard input, where the first line contains the number of elements `n` and the second line contains `n` integers.**
