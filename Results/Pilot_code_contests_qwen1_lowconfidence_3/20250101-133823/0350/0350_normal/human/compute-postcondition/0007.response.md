`q` is assigned the value `[0] * size`, which means `q` is a list of `size` zeros. The value of `size` is `len(A)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}), `A` is a map object of integers entered on the second line of input, `idx` is 0, `size` is `len(A)`, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` is a list of `size` zeros, and `q` is a list of `size` zeros.
