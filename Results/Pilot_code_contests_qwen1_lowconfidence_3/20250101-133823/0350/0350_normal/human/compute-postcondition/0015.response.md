The code snippet updates the value of `p[i]` to be `p[i - 1] + 1`. Since `p[i - 1]` was previously a value greater than 0 (as stated in the precondition), adding 1 to it will result in a new value for `p[i]` that is exactly one more than the original value of `p[i - 1]`.

The states of the other variables (`size` and the list `A`) are not affected.

Output State: **`size` must be at least 2, `A` is a list of integers, `p[i]` is `p[i - 1] + 1`, and `p[i - 1]` is greater than 0**
