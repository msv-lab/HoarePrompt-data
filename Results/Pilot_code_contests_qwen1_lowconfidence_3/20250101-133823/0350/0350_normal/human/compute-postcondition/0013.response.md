Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial State:
- \( n \) is an integer (\(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\))
- \( A \) is a map object of integers
- \( idx \) is 0
- \( size \) is \( len(A) \)
- \( total \) is \( size \times (1 + size) / 2 \)
- \( p \) is a list of \( size \) zeros
- \( q \) is a list of \( size \) zeros
- If \( A[0] > 0 \), then \( p[0] = 1 \) and \( q[0] = 0 \).
- If \( A[0] \leq 0 \), then \( q[0] = 1 \) and \( p[0] = 0 \).

### For Loop:
```python
for i in xrange(1, size):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Initialization**: The loop starts with \( i = 1 \). For the loop to execute, \( i \) must be less than \( size \).

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as \( i < size \). Since \( i \) starts at 1, we need to ensure that \( size \) is at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once.

3. **Other States**:
   - The initial values of \( idx \) (0), \( p \), and \( q \) do not affect the loop execution directly. However, the values of \( A[0] \) influence the initialization of \( p[0] \) and \( q[0] \).

### Adjusted States:
To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to ensure that \( size \geq 2 \).

Therefore, the state that needs adjustment is:
- **`size` must be at least 2**.

### Final Answer:
State: **`size` must be at least 2**
