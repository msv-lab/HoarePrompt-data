You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n consisting of n non-zero integers (i.e. a_i ≠ 0). 

You have to calculate two following values:

  1. the number of pairs of indices (l, r) (l ≤ r) such that a_l ⋅ a_{l + 1} ... a_{r - 1} ⋅ a_r is negative; 
  2. the number of pairs of indices (l, r) (l ≤ r) such that a_l ⋅ a_{l + 1} ... a_{r - 1} ⋅ a_r is positive; 

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the number of elements in the sequence.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^{9} ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9}; a_i ≠ 0) — the elements of the sequence.

Output

Print two integers — the number of subsegments with negative product and the number of subsegments with positive product, respectively.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys
import collections
import bisect
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) representing the number of elements in the sequence, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^{9} ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9}; a_i ≠ 0) representing the elements of the sequence.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)
    n = int(raw_input())
    A = map(int, input().split())
    idx, size = 0, len(A)
    total = size * (1 + size) / 2
    p = [0] * size
    q = [0] * size
    if (A[0] > 0) :
        p[0], q[0] = 1, 0
    else :
        q[0], p[0] = 1, 0
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}), `A` is a map object of integers, `idx` is 0, `size` is `len(A)`, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` is a list of `size` zeros, `q` is a list of `size` zeros. If `A[0] > 0`, then `p[0]` is 1 and `q[0]` is 0. If `A[0] ≤ 0`, then `q[0]` is 1 and `p[0]` is 0.
    for i in xrange(1, size):
        if A[i] > 0:
            p[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
            q[i] = q[i - 1]
        else:
            p[i] = q[i - 1]
            q[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `size` is the length of the list `A`, `p[i]` is the count of positive elements in `A` up to index `i` plus the initial value `p[0]`, and `q[i]` is the count of non-positive elements in `A` up to index `i` plus the initial value `q[0]`.
    print('%s %s' % (sum(q), sum(p)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a sequence of integers provided through standard input. It reads the number of elements `n` and the sequence itself, then calculates the cumulative counts of positive and non-positive elements up to each index in the sequence. Specifically, it maintains two arrays `p` and `q`, where `p[i]` represents the count of positive elements in the sequence up to index `i` including the initial value, and `q[i]` represents the count of non-positive elements up to index `i` including the initial value. After processing, the function prints the total count of non-positive elements and the total count of positive elements in the sequence. Potential edge cases include the sequence having only one element, which would initialize both `p[0]` and `q[0]` to either 1 or 0 depending on the sign of the first element. Missing functionality includes handling empty input sequences, although the provided code does not explicitly handle this case; it assumes `n` is always greater than zero.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
