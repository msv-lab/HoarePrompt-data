Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program contains several issues that cause it to not meet the problem description for certain cases:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` instead of `input()`. This will cause a syntax error in Python 3, as `raw_input()` was renamed to `input()` in Python 3. This needs to be corrected to `input()`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation Logic**: The logic for calculating the number of subsegments with positive and negative products is flawed. Specifically:
   - The initial conditions for `p` and `q` should be correctly set up.
   - The transitions between positive and negative products need to be handled properly. The current logic only considers the sign of the current element but fails to account for the correct accumulation of positive and negative subsegments.

Here's a revised version of the function to handle these issues correctly:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize p and q
    p = [0] * n
    q = [0] * n
    
    # Handle the first element
    if A[0] > 0:
        p[0] = 1
    else:
        q[0] = 1
    
    # Calculate the number of positive and negative subsegments
    for i in range(1, n):
        if A[i] > 0:
            p[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
            q[i] = q[i - 1]
        else:
            p[i] = q[i - 1]
            q[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
    
    # Calculate the result
    pos_count = sum(p)
    neg_count = sum(q)
    
    print(f"{neg_count} {pos_count}")

func()
```

This corrected version should now properly calculate the number of subsegments with positive and negative products for all valid inputs.
