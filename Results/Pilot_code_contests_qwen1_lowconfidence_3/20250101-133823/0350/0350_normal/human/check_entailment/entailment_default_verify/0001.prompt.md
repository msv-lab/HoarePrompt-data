You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n consisting of n non-zero integers (i.e. a_i ≠ 0). 

You have to calculate two following values:

  1. the number of pairs of indices (l, r) (l ≤ r) such that a_l ⋅ a_{l + 1} ... a_{r - 1} ⋅ a_r is negative; 
  2. the number of pairs of indices (l, r) (l ≤ r) such that a_l ⋅ a_{l + 1} ... a_{r - 1} ⋅ a_r is positive; 

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the number of elements in the sequence.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^{9} ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9}; a_i ≠ 0) — the elements of the sequence.

Output

Print two integers — the number of subsegments with negative product and the number of subsegments with positive product, respectively.

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)
    n = int(raw_input())
    A = map(int, input().split())
    (idx, size) = (0, len(A))
    total = size * (1 + size) / 2
    p = [0] * size
    q = [0] * size
    if A[0] > 0:
        (p[0], q[0]) = (1, 0)
    else:
        (q[0], p[0]) = (1, 0)
    for i in xrange(1, size):
        if A[i] > 0:
            p[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
            q[i] = q[i - 1]
        else:
            p[i] = q[i - 1]
            q[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
    print('%s %s' % (sum(q), sum(p)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for some cases. Specifically, the line `n = int(raw_input())` is incorrect because `raw_input()` is not defined in the current environment (Python 3 uses `input()` instead). Additionally, the program does not handle sequences with zeros, which is explicitly stated as non-zero integers in the problem description.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize counters
    pos_count = 0
    neg_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through the array
    for i in range(n):
        sign = 1 if A[i] > 0 else -1
        pos_count += (i + 1) * (n - i)
        neg_count += (i + 1) * (n - i)
        
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            sign *= A[j]
            if sign > 0:
                pos_count -= 1
            elif sign < 0:
                neg_count -= 1
            else:
                break
    
    print(neg_count, pos_count)

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles the input and iterates through all possible subsegments to count the positive and negative products. It avoids the issues with `raw_input()` and ensures it works correctly for all non-zero integer sequences.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes a sequence of integers provided through standard input. It reads the number of elements `n` and the sequence itself, then calculates the cumulative counts of positive and non-positive elements up to each index in the sequence. Specifically, it maintains two arrays `p` and `q`, where `p[i]` represents the count of positive elements in the sequence up to index `i` including the initial value, and `q[i]` represents the count of non-positive elements up to index `i` including the initial value. After processing, the function prints the total count of non-positive elements and the total count of positive elements in the sequence. Potential edge cases include the sequence having only one element, which would initialize both `p[0]` and `q[0]` to either 1 or 0 depending on the sign of the first element. Missing functionality includes handling empty input sequences, although the provided code does not explicitly handle this case; it assumes `n` is always greater than zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
