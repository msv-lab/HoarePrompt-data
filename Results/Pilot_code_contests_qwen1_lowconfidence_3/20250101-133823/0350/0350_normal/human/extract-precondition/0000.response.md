Precondition: **The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) representing the number of elements in the sequence, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^{9} ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9}; a_i ≠ 0) representing the elements of the sequence.**
