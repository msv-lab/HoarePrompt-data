The function reads a list of integers from standard input, processes the list to find either the sum of the absolute values of the elements or the maximum value of a specific condition involving sums and differences of subarrays, and prints the result. Specifically, if the list contains any negative numbers, it calculates and prints the sum of the absolute values of the elements. If the list contains no negative numbers, it finds the maximum value of the sum of the list minus a single element, under certain conditions (either before or after the current element). The function accepts a list of integers and returns nothing (prints the result), handling edge cases where the input list might be empty or contain only positive numbers.
