You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n slimes in a row. Each slime has an integer value (possibly negative or zero) associated with it.

Any slime can eat its adjacent slime (the closest slime to its left or to its right, assuming that this slime exists). 

When a slime with a value x eats a slime with a value y, the eaten slime disappears, and the value of the remaining slime changes to x - y.

The slimes will eat each other until there is only one slime left. 

Find the maximum possible value of the last slime.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500 000) denoting the number of slimes.

The next line contains n integers a_i (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the value of i-th slime.

Output

Print an only integer — the maximum possible value of the last slime.

Examples

Input

4
2 1 2 1


Output

4

Input

5
0 -1 -1 -1 -1


Output

4

Note

In the first example, a possible way of getting the last slime with value 4 is:

  * Second slime eats the third slime, the row now contains slimes 2, -1, 1
  * Second slime eats the third slime, the row now contains slimes 2, -2
  * First slime eats the second slime, the row now contains 4 



In the second example, the first slime can keep eating slimes to its right to end up with a value of 4.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    (n, a) = (int(input()), rints())
    neg = len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, a)))
    pos = n - neg
    if neg:
        print(sum((abs(x) for x in a)))
    else:
        (ans, s) = (0, sum(a))
        for i in range(n):
            if i and a[i] < a[i - 1]:
                ans = max(ans, s - a[i - 1])
            elif i < n - 1 and a[i] < a[i + 1]:
                ans = max(ans, s - a[i + 1])
        print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where all slimes have positive values correctly. According to the problem description, the goal is to maximize the value of the last remaining slime by strategically choosing which slimes to eat. However, the current implementation incorrectly sums the absolute values of all slimes when there are any negative slimes present, which does not always yield the maximum possible value of the last slime.

For instance, consider the input:
```
4
1 2 3 4
```

The correct output should be:
```
10
```

But the program outputs:
```
10
```

However, the program also fails in another scenario:
```
3
-1 2 -3
```

The correct output should be:
```
-2
```

But the program outputs:
```
5
```

This is because the program does not correctly handle the strategy of combining positive and negative slimes to maximize the final value. It simply sums the absolute values of all slimes when there are negative slimes, which can lead to suboptimal results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads a list of integers from standard input, processes the list to find either the sum of the absolute values of the elements or the maximum value of a specific condition involving sums and differences of subarrays, and prints the result. Specifically, if the list contains any negative numbers, it calculates and prints the sum of the absolute values of the elements. If the list contains no negative numbers, it finds the maximum value of the sum of the list minus a single element, under certain conditions (either before or after the current element). The function accepts a list of integers and returns nothing (prints the result), handling edge cases where the input list might be empty or contain only positive numbers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
