You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are n slimes in a row. Each slime has an integer value (possibly negative or zero) associated with it.

Any slime can eat its adjacent slime (the closest slime to its left or to its right, assuming that this slime exists). 

When a slime with a value x eats a slime with a value y, the eaten slime disappears, and the value of the remaining slime changes to x - y.

The slimes will eat each other until there is only one slime left. 

Find the maximum possible value of the last slime.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500 000) denoting the number of slimes.

The next line contains n integers a_i (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the value of i-th slime.

Output

Print an only integer — the maximum possible value of the last slime.

Examples

Input

4
2 1 2 1


Output

4

Input

5
0 -1 -1 -1 -1


Output

4

Note

In the first example, a possible way of getting the last slime with value 4 is:

  * Second slime eats the third slime, the row now contains slimes 2, -1, 1
  * Second slime eats the third slime, the row now contains slimes 2, -2
  * First slime eats the second slime, the row now contains 4 



In the second example, the first slime can keep eating slimes to its right to end up with a value of 4.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500 000, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    n, a = int(input()), rints()
    neg = len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, a)))
    pos = n - neg
    if neg :
        print(sum(abs(x) for x in a))
    else :
        ans, s = 0, sum(a)
        for i in range(n):
            if i and a[i] < a[i - 1]:
                ans = max(ans, s - a[i - 1])
            elif i < n - 1 and a[i] < a[i + 1]:
                ans = max(ans, s - a[i + 1])
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans` throughout the loop executions, considering the conditions: if `i and a[i] < a[i - 1]` is true, then `ans` is updated to `max(ans, s - a[i - 1])`; if `i < n - 1 and a[i] < a[i + 1]` is true, then `ans` is updated to `max(ans, s - a[i + 1])`. `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`.
        print(ans)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is the total number of integers read from input, `a` is the list of `n` integers read from input using `rints()`, `neg` is the count of negative integers in `a`, `pos` is `n - neg`. If `neg` is non-zero, the output is the sum of the absolute values of the elements in `a`. If `neg` is zero, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans` throughout the loop executions, and `ans` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a list of integers from standard input, processes the list to find either the sum of the absolute values of the elements or the maximum value of a specific condition involving sums and differences of subarrays, and prints the result. Specifically, if the list contains any negative numbers, it calculates and prints the sum of the absolute values of the elements. If the list contains no negative numbers, it finds the maximum value of the sum of the list minus a single element, under certain conditions (either before or after the current element). The function accepts a list of integers and returns nothing (prints the result), handling edge cases where the input list might be empty or contain only positive numbers.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
