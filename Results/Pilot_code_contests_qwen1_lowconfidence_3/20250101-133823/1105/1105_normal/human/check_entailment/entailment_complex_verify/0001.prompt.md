You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n slimes in a row. Each slime has an integer value (possibly negative or zero) associated with it.

Any slime can eat its adjacent slime (the closest slime to its left or to its right, assuming that this slime exists). 

When a slime with a value x eats a slime with a value y, the eaten slime disappears, and the value of the remaining slime changes to x - y.

The slimes will eat each other until there is only one slime left. 

Find the maximum possible value of the last slime.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500 000) denoting the number of slimes.

The next line contains n integers a_i (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the value of i-th slime.

Output

Print an only integer — the maximum possible value of the last slime.

Examples

Input

4
2 1 2 1


Output

4

Input

5
0 -1 -1 -1 -1


Output

4

Note

In the first example, a possible way of getting the last slime with value 4 is:

  * Second slime eats the third slime, the row now contains slimes 2, -1, 1
  * Second slime eats the third slime, the row now contains slimes 2, -2
  * First slime eats the second slime, the row now contains 4 



In the second example, the first slime can keep eating slimes to its right to end up with a value of 4.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    (n, a) = (int(input()), rints())
    neg = len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, a)))
    pos = n - neg
    if neg:
        print(sum((abs(x) for x in a)))
    else:
        (ans, s) = (0, sum(a))
        for i in range(n):
            if i and a[i] < a[i - 1]:
                ans = max(ans, s - a[i - 1])
            elif i < n - 1 and a[i] < a[i + 1]:
                ans = max(ans, s - a[i + 1])
        print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where all slimes have non-negative values. In such cases, the program incorrectly calculates the maximum possible value of the last slime.

Let's consider an example to illustrate this issue:

### Example:
**Input:**
```
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6
```

**Actual Output:**
```
6
```

**Issue Explanation:**
- The program correctly identifies that there are no negative values (`neg = 0`).
- It then attempts to calculate the sum of absolute values (`sum((abs(x) for x in a))`), which results in `6`.
- However, the correct approach should be to keep the largest value and subtract the smallest values from it, ensuring the maximum possible value of the last slime.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure it always keeps the largest value and subtracts all smaller values from it. Here’s a revised version of the function that addresses this issue:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    (n, a) = (int(input()), rints())
    
    # Find the maximum value in the list
    max_val = max(a)
    
    # Subtract all other values from the maximum value
    for val in a:
        if val != max_val:
            max_val -= val
    
    print(max_val)

func()
```

This revised version ensures that the maximum possible value of the last slime is calculated correctly by always keeping the largest value and subtracting all others.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from sys import stdin

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500 000, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    n, a = int(input()), rints()
    neg = len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, a)))
    pos = n - neg
    if neg :
        print(sum(abs(x) for x in a))
    else :
        ans, s = 0, sum(a)
        for i in range(n):
            if i and a[i] < a[i - 1]:
                ans = max(ans, s - a[i - 1])
            elif i < n - 1 and a[i] < a[i + 1]:
                ans = max(ans, s - a[i + 1])
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans` throughout the loop executions, considering the conditions: if `i and a[i] < a[i - 1]` is true, then `ans` is updated to `max(ans, s - a[i - 1])`; if `i < n - 1 and a[i] < a[i + 1]` is true, then `ans` is updated to `max(ans, s - a[i + 1])`. `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`.
        print(ans)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is the total number of integers read from input, `a` is the list of `n` integers read from input using `rints()`, `neg` is the count of negative integers in `a`, `pos` is `n - neg`. If `neg` is non-zero, the output is the sum of the absolute values of the elements in `a`. If `neg` is zero, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans` throughout the loop executions, and `ans` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a list of integers from standard input, processes the list to find either the sum of the absolute values of the elements or the maximum value of a specific condition involving sums and differences of subarrays, and prints the result. Specifically, if the list contains any negative numbers, it calculates and prints the sum of the absolute values of the elements. If the list contains no negative numbers, it finds the maximum value of the sum of the list minus a single element, under certain conditions (either before or after the current element). The function accepts a list of integers and returns nothing (prints the result), handling edge cases where the input list might be empty or contain only positive numbers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
