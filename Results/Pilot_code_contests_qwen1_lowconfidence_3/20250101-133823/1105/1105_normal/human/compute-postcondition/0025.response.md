Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `s - a[1]` if the condition `i and a[i] < a[i - 1]` is true. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `s - a[3]` if `2 < n - 1` and `a[2] < a[3]`. If `i < n - 1 and a[i] < a[i + 1]` is true, then `ans` is updated accordingly. If the condition is false, `ans` remains unchanged.**
