Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, the current value of `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]` (Note: Since `i` is 0, `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[-1]`, which is out of bounds and thus not applicable, but the condition implies that `a[0]` is less than `a[-1]` is not possible, hence this part is inherently false and does not change the postcondition)**
