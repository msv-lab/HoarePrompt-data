Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**: The loop `for i in range(n):` means that the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. This implies that `i` starts at 0 and increments until it reaches `n`.

2. **Determine Necessary States for Loop Execution**:
   - **Variable `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0.
   - **Variable `n`**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - **List `a`**: The list `a` contains `n` integers, so there must be `n` elements in the list.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - **`neg`**, **`pos`**, **`ans`**, and **`s`**: These variables are not directly relevant to the condition for the loop to execute. They might be modified within the loop body but do not affect the loop's initiation.

Based on the above analysis, the necessary states to adjust for the loop to execute are:

- `i` should be 0.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `a` must have `n` elements (since `a` is a list of `n` integers).

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers**
