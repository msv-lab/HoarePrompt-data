The given code defines a lambda function `rints` which reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. This function does not actually read any values yet; it only defines how such values would be read if the function were called.

Therefore, the values of the variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged. The lambda function `rints` is now available to be used for reading input, but no actual input has been read.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500 000, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `rints` is a lambda function defined as `[int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]`**
