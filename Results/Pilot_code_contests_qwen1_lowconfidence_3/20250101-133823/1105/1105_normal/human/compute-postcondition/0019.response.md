Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `ans` is either unchanged or updated to the maximum of its previous value and `s - a[i + 1]` if `i` < `n - 1` and `a[i]` < `a[i + 1]`. Given the if condition, if `i < n - 1` and `a[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `s - a[2]` if `n > 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
