Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `s - a[i]` if `i < n - 1` and `a[i] < a[i + 1]`. If the if condition `i and a[i] < a[i - 1]` is false, then `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `s - a[1]` if `n > 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
