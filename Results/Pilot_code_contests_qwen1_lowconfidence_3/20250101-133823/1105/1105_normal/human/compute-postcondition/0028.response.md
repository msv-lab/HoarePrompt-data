Postcondition: **`n` is the total number of integers read from input, `a` is the list of `n` integers read from input using `rints()`, `neg` is the count of negative integers in `a`, `pos` is `n - neg`. If `neg` is non-zero, the output is the sum of the absolute values of the elements in `a`. If `neg` is zero, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans` throughout the loop executions, and `ans` is printed.**
