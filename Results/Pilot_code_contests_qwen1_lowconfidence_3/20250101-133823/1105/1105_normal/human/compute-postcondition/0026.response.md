Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans` throughout the loop executions, considering the conditions: if `i and a[i] < a[i - 1]` is true, then `ans` is updated to `max(ans, s - a[i - 1])`; if `i < n - 1 and a[i] < a[i + 1]` is true, then `ans` is updated to `max(ans, s - a[i + 1])`. `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`.**
