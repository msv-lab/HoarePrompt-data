The code `pos = n - neg` calculates the number of positive integers in the list `a` by subtracting the count of negative integers (`neg`) from the total number of integers (`n`). 

- The value of `n` is the total number of integers initially read from input.
- The value of `neg` is the count of negative integers in the list `a`.
- The value of `a` remains unchanged.

The new variable `pos` is assigned the value of `n - neg`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the total number of integers read from input, `a` is the list of `n` integers read from input using `rints()`, `neg` is the count of negative integers in `a`, `pos` is `n - neg`.**
