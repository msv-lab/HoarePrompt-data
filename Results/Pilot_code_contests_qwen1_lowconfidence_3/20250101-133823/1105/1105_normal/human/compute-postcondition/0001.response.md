The code `n, a = int(input()), rints()` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the standard input. It then assigns the integer to `n` and the list of integers to `a`. The state of the `rints` lambda function remains unchanged, but the value of `a` changes.

Given the initial state where `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500,000\) and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), after executing the code, `n` is updated to the integer read from the input, and `a` is updated to the list of integers read from the input using the `rints` function.

Output State: **`n` is the integer read from input, `a` is the list of `n` integers read from input using `rints()`, `rints` is the lambda function `[int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]`**
