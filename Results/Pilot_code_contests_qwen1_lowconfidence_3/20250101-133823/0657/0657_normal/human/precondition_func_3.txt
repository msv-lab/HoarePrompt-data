None of the variables in the function `func_4` are provided in the function signature. However, the function reads input from the standard input. The input consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), representing the number of number tiles in the bag, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (each `a_i ∈ \{1, 2\}`), representing the values written on the tiles.
