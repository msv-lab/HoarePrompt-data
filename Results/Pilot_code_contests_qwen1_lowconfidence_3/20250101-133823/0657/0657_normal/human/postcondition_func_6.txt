The function `func_7` accepts a list `l` of integers, where each integer is either 1 or 2. It then sorts the list in ascending order using the `sorted` function with a custom key (`getKey`), which ensures the sorting is based on the natural order of integers. The function returns a new list of integers that is sorted in ascending order, where each integer remains either 1 or 2. This means that the original list `l` is not modified; instead, a new sorted list is returned. Potential edge cases include an empty list or a list with only one element, which would both result in the same list being returned. Additionally, if `getKey` is not defined or does not work correctly, the sorting might not behave as expected, although the default sorting behavior of integers should handle the case correctly.
