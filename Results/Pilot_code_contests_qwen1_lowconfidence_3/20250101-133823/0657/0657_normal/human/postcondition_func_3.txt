The function `func_4` reads two lines of input from the standard input. The first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), which represents the number of number tiles in the bag. The second line contains `n` space-separated integers, each being either 1 or 2, representing the values written on the tiles. The function then returns a map object containing these integers. This map object can be iterated over to access the sequence of integers read from the input. Potential edge cases include when `n` is exactly 1 or 200,000, or when the input integers are not strictly 1 or 2, although such cases would result in an error due to the conversion to integers. The function does not handle such errors explicitly, so the caller must ensure valid input.
