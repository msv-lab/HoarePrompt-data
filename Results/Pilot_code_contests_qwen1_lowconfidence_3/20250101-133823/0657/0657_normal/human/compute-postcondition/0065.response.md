The function `func_1(*s)` is called with the sequence `s` unpacked as arguments. However, since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables. We know that `s` is a sequence of alternating 1s and 2s, and the function will process this sequence in some way.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200000\)
- `s` contains a sequence of alternating 1s and 2s
- `one` is 0
- `two` is 0
- `p` ends with an even number

Since `func_1(*s)` is called without further details about its implementation, we can only say that the sequence `s` is being processed. The variables `one` and `two` could potentially be updated based on the elements in `s`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the property of `p` (ending with an even number) is also unaffected.

Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values and the potential updates to `one` and `two` based on the sequence `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200000\); `s` contains a sequence of alternating 1s and 2s; `one` is updated based on the sequence `s`; `two` is updated based on the sequence `s`; `p` ends with an even number.**
