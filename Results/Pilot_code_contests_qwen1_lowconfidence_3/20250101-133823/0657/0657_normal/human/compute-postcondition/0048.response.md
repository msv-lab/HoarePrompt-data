Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - If `one` is not 0, then `one` is -1, `s` is [2, 1], `two` is -1, and `p` is [0].
   - Otherwise, `one` is 0, `s` is [2, 2], `two` is one less than its previous value, and `p` is [0, 2].

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, n)`.
   - Since `i` is 2, the loop condition `1 <= i < n` must hold true for the loop to continue.

3. **Determining the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented from 2 to 3 (since `i` starts from 1).
   - Therefore, `i` must be 3.
   - Since `i` is now 3, the loop condition `1 <= i < n` still holds if `n` is greater than 3.
   - However, since `n` must be greater than 1 initially and we are incrementing `i` to 3, `n` must remain greater than 3 to allow the loop to continue.

4. **Updating States:**
   - `i` is updated to 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 3.
   - The values of `one`, `s`, `two`, and `p` do not change based on the loop itself but depend on the initial conditions and the values of other variables.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` must be 3.
- `n` must be greater than 3.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3**
