The code `p.append(p[-1] + 1)` appends to the list `p` the value of the last element of `p` plus one. Initially, `p` is not defined in the given state, but based on the code, it is implied that `p` is being created and modified here. Given that `s` is `[1]`, we can infer that `p` starts as `[1]`. 

- The last element of `p` is `1`.
- Adding `1` to the last element gives `2`.
- Thus, `p` becomes `[1, 2]`.

The other variables (`n` and `i`) are not affected by this code. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `s` is [1], `p` is [1, 2]**
