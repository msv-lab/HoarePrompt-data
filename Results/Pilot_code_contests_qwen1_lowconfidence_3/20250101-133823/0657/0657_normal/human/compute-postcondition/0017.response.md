`s` is a list that gets a new element appended to it, specifically the value `2`. The value of `n` must be greater than 1, `i` remains unchanged at 1, the last element of list `p` is even, and `one` remains at 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, the last element of list `p` is even, `one` is 0, `s` is a list containing the elements `[2]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, the last element of list `p` is even, `one` is 0, `s` is a list containing the elements `[2]`**
