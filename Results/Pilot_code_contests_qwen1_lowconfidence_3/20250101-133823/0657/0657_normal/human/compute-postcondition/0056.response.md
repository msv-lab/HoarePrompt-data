`s.append(2)` appends the value `2` to the list `s`. Since the initial state does not specify the existence of `s`, we assume it is initialized as an empty list before this line of code. The value of `n` and `i` remains unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `s` is [2]**
