To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200000\)
- `l` is the value returned by `func_5()`
- `a` is a list of 200000 elements with the pattern `[1, 1, 1, 2]` repeated 50000 times
- `s` is a list containing `[2]`
- `one` is 0
- `two` is `two - 1`
- `p` is a list containing `[2]`

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop will iterate from `1` to `n-1`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1.

### States to Adjust:
- The loop will only execute if `n > 1`.
- Since the loop starts from `1`, `i` will take values from `1` to `n-1`. Hence, before the loop starts, `i` should be `1`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
