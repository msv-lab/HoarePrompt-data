`s.append(1)` appends the integer `1` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` is `[2]`. After appending `1` to `s`, the list `s` becomes `[2, 1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `one` is 0, `s` is [2, 1], `two` is one less than its previous value**
