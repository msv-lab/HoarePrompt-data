`one` is decremented by 1. Initially, `one` is 0, so after the decrement, `one` becomes -1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `one` is -1, `s` is [2, 1], `two` is one less than its previous value, `p` is [1].

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `one` is -1, `s` is [2, 1], `two` is one less than its previous value, `p` is [1]**
