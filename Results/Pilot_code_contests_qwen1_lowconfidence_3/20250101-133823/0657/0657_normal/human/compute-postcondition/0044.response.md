The code snippet `p.append(p[-1] + 1)` appends the value of `p[-1] + 1` to the list `p`. Initially, `p` is not defined, but since no initial value is given for `p`, it means `p` is an empty list before the code is executed. After executing the code, `p` will be `[1]` because `p[-1]` (which is the last element of an empty list, which is non-existent) is considered as `0` in this context, and `0 + 1` equals `1`.

Other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the updated state is as follows:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `one` is 0, `s` is [2, 1], `two` is one less than its previous value, `p` is [1]**
