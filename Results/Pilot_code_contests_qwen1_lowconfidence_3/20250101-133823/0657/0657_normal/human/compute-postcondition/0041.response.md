The code appends `p[-1] + 2` to the list `p`. Since `p` is not defined initially, we assume it is an empty list. Therefore, `p[-1]` would be considered as 0 (the index `-1` refers to the last element in the list, which does not exist, so it defaults to 0). Thus, `p.append(0 + 2)` adds `2` to the list `p`.

- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `i` remains 2.
- `one` remains 0.
- `s` remains `[2, 2]`.
- `two` is one less than its previous value, which was `one`, so `two` is now `-1`.

The updated list `p` is `[2]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `one` is 0, `s` is [2, 2], `two` is -1, `p` is [2]**
