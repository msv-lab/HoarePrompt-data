The code snippet appends the value of the last element in the list `p` plus 1 to the list `p`. Initially, `p` is not defined, so it must be an empty list before this operation. Given the initial state, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, and `s` is [1]. After executing the code, `p` will be `[1]` because initially it is an empty list, and the first element appended is `0 + 1` (since `p[-1]` is `0` by default for an empty list).

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `s` is [1], `p` is [1]**
