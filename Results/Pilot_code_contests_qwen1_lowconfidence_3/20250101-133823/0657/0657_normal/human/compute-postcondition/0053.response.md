The code `p.append(p[-1] + 2)` appends the value of the last element in list `p` plus 2 to the end of the list `p`. Initially, `p` is not explicitly defined, but since `s` is `[2]`, it's reasonable to infer that `p` is the same list `s`. Therefore, `p[-1]` refers to the last element in `s`, which is `2`.

The code updates `p` (which is `s`) by appending `2 + 2`, which is `4`, to the list. So, `s` becomes `[2, 4]`.

The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `s` is [2, 4].

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `s` is [2, 4]**
