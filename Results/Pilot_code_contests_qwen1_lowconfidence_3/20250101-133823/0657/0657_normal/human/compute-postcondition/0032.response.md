Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- Based on the conditions provided, we need to determine the initial values of `one`, `two`, and `s`.

### Conditions:
- If the last element of `p` is odd:
  - `one` is one less than its previous value.
  - `s` is `[1]`.
- If the last element of `p` is even:
  - `one` is 0.
  - `s` is a list containing the elements `[2]`, and `two` is reduced by 1.
  - If `two` is not 0, `two` is decremented by 1, `s` is a list with an additional element 2, and the last element of `p` remains even.
  - If `two` is 0, `s` is `[1]`, `one` is one less than its original value, and the last element of `p` remains even.

### Given Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to become 2.

### Determining New States:
1. **Condition Check**: We need to check the condition for the last element of `p` based on the previous state.
2. **Adjusting States**: Based on the condition, we adjust the states accordingly.

Given that `i` is currently 1 and will be incremented to 2, let's consider the possible scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Last Element of `p` is Odd
- `one` would be one less than its previous value.
- `s` would be `[1]`.

#### Scenario 2: Last Element of `p` is Even
- `one` would be 0.
- `s` would be `[2]`.
- `two` would be reduced by 1.
- If `two` was not 0, it would be decremented by 1, `s` would be a list with an additional element 2, and the last element of `p` would remain even.
- If `two` was 0, `s` would be `[1]`, `one` would be one less than its original value, and the last element of `p` would remain even.

Since the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`, and `i` will be incremented from 1 to 2, we need to consider the condition for the next iteration.

### Conclusion:
- `i` will be 2.
- The condition for the last element of `p` will be checked again.

If the last element of `p` is odd:
- `one` will be one less than its previous value.
- `s` will be `[1]`.

If the last element of `p` is even:
- `one` will be 0.
- `s` will be `[2]`.
- `two` will be reduced by 1 (if `two` was not 0).

Since we don't know the exact values of `one`, `two`, and `s` from the previous iteration, we will assume the most general case where the last element of `p` is even and `two` is not 0.

### Final State:
- `i` will be 2.
- `one` will be 0.
- `s` will be `[2]`.
- `two` will be one less than its previous value.

Therefore, the updated states are:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `one` is 0, `s` is [2], `two` is one less than its previous value**.
