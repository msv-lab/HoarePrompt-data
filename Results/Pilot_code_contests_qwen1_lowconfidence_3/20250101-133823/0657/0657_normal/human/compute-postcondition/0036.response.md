`s.append(2)` adds the value `2` to the list `s`. The initial value of `s` is `[2]`, so after appending `2`, `s` becomes `[2, 2]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `one` is 0, `s` is `[2, 2]`, `two` is one less than its previous value.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `one` is 0, `s` is `[2, 2]`, `two` is one less than its previous value**
