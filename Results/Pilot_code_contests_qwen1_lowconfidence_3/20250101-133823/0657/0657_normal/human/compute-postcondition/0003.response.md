The code initializes an empty list `s`. No values are assigned to `s`, and no changes are made to the values of `n`, `l`, or `a`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `l` is the value returned by `func_5()`; `a` is a list of 200000 elements with the pattern [1, 1, 1, 2] repeated 50000 times; `s` is an empty list**
