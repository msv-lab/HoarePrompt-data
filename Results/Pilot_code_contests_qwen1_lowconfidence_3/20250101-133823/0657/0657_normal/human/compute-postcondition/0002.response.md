The list `a` is assigned the value `[1, 1, 1, 2] * 50000`, which creates a list with 200000 elements, consisting of 50000 repetitions of the sublist `[1, 1, 1, 2]`. The variables `n` and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `l` is the value returned by `func_5()`; `a` is a list of 200000 elements with the pattern [1, 1, 1, 2] repeated 50000 times.**
