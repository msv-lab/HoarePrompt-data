The code snippet assigns the value returned by `func_2()` to `n`. However, the function `func_2()` is not defined in the provided information. Since we don't know what `func_2()` does, we cannot determine the exact value of `n` after its execution. But we know that `n` will be an integer between 1 and 200,000, inclusive, because that was the precondition.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000**
