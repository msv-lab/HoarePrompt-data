The code `p.append(p[-1] + 1)` appends to the list `p` the value of the last element of `p` plus one. Given that the last element of `p` is even, adding one to an even number results in an odd number. The value of `n` is not affected, nor is `i`, `one`, or `s`. 

Let's denote the last element of `p` before the append operation as `last_element_p`. Since `last_element_p` is even, the new last element of `p` after the append operation will be `last_element_p + 1`, which is odd.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, the last element of list `p` is odd, the current value of `one` is not 0, `s` is [1]**
