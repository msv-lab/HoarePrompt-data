`p` is a list that gets a new element appended to it, which is the value of the last element of `p` plus 2. Initially, `p` is `[2]`. So, `p[-1]` is `2`. Therefore, the new element appended to `p` is `2 + 2`, which is `4`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `s` is [2], `p` is [2, 4]**
