`s.append(2)` appends the integer `2` to the list `s`. The initial state does not provide any specific value for `s`, so after appending `2`, the list `s` will contain `[2]`. The variables `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `s` is [2]**
