`s` is appended with the value `1`. The initial state of `n` being greater than 1, `i` being 1, the last element of the list `p` being odd, and `two` being 0 are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, the last element of the list `p` is odd, `two` is 0, and `s` is `[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, the last element of the list `p` is odd, `two` is 0, and `s` is `[1]`**
