The value of `one` is decremented by 1. Initially, `one` is 0, so after the subtraction, `one` becomes -1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `one` is -1, `s` is [2, 1], `two` is -1, `p` is [0]**
