Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the last element of the list `p` is even and `two` is not 0, then `two` is decremented by 1, `s` is a list with an additional element 2, and the last element of `p` remains even. If `two` is 0, then `s` is `[1]`, `one` is one less than its original value, and the last element of `p` remains even.***
