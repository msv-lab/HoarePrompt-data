`p.append(p[-1] + 2)` appends the value of the last element of `p` plus 2 to the list `p`. Since the last element of `p` is even, let's denote it as `last_even`. The new element appended will be `last_even + 2`, which is even. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, the last element of list `p` is `last_even + 2`, `one` is 0, `s` is a list containing the elements `[2]`**
