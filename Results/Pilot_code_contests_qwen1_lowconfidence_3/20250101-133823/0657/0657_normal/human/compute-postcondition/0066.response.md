The function `func_14` accepts a parameter `l`, which is a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or 2, and the length of the list `n` satisfies the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. The function does not return an error message for negative input values since the problem statement does not specify any such condition. Instead, it returns a specific value based on the contents of the list `l`.

There are no explicit return conditions provided in the example output, but based on the structure given, we can infer that the function might count the occurrences of 1s and 2s in the list and return a specific value accordingly.

However, without further specification on the exact return values based on the contents of the list, we can still describe the function's basic behavior in terms of its parameters and expected return types.
