The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to 200,000, where the binary representation of `n` consists only of the digits 1 and 2. After processing, it returns a list of integers, where each integer is either 1 or 2, representing the binary digits of the original integer `n`. The function correctly handles the conversion of `n` to its binary representation and ensures that only the digits 1 and 2 are present. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself that need special handling beyond the given constraints.
