Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly generate a permutation of the input list that maximizes the number of prefix sums being prime numbers. The code attempts to create a sequence by repeating a predefined pattern `[1, 1, 1, 2]` and then adjusting based on the counts of 1s and 2s. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting sequence will maximize the number of prime prefix sums for every possible input.

For instance, consider the input `[1, 1, 2, 1]`. The code generates the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 5]`, which results in prefix sums `[2, 5, 9, 14]` (only the first sum is prime). However, a better sequence would be `[1, 2, 1, 1]`, which gives prefix sums `[1, 3, 4, 5]` (two prime sums).

Additionally, the code does not handle cases where the counts of 1s and 2s are very uneven, leading to suboptimal sequences. For example, with `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]`, the code might generate a sequence that does not maximize the number of prime prefix sums.

Given these issues, the program does not always follow the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
