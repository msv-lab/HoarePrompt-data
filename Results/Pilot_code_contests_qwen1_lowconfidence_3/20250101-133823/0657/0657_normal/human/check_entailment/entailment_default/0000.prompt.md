You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We're giving away nice huge bags containing number tiles! A bag we want to present to you contains n tiles. Each of them has a single number written on it — either 1 or 2.

However, there is one condition you must fulfill in order to receive the prize. You will need to put all the tiles from the bag in a sequence, in any order you wish. We will then compute the sums of all prefixes in the sequence, and then count how many of these sums are prime numbers. If you want to keep the prize, you will need to maximize the number of primes you get.

Can you win the prize? Hurry up, the bags are waiting!

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of number tiles in the bag. The following line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i ∈ \{1, 2\}) — the values written on the tiles.

Output

Output a permutation b_1, b_2, ..., b_n of the input sequence (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) maximizing the number of the prefix sums being prime numbers. If there are multiple optimal permutations, output any.

Examples

Input


5
1 2 1 2 1


Output


1 1 1 2 2


Input


9
1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1


Output


1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1

Note

The first solution produces the prefix sums 1, \mathbf{\color{blue}{2}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{3}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{5}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{7}} (four primes constructed), while the prefix sums in the second solution are 1, \mathbf{\color{blue}{2}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{3}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{5}}, 6, \mathbf{\color{blue}{7}}, 8, 10, \mathbf{\color{blue}{11}} (five primes). Primes are marked bold and blue. In each of these cases, the number of produced primes is maximum possible.

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` takes a list `tiles` as input, where each element in the list is either 1 or 2, and the length of the list is between 1 and 200,000 inclusive. It then writes the string representation of each element in `tiles` to a specified output stream (`file`), separated by a separator string (`sep`). The function also handles optional keyword arguments such as `end` (to append to the end of the output), and `flush` (to flush the write buffer). If the `flush` argument is `True`, the write buffer is flushed after the output is written. The function does not modify the original `tiles` list but constructs a new string representation of the list with separators and appends it to the `file`. If no `file` is provided, it defaults to `sys.stdout`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of tiles, followed by a line of `n` space-separated integers where each integer is either 1 or 2 representing the values on the tiles. The function then returns these values as a list of integers. There are no additional operations performed on these values within the function. Potential edge cases include when `n` is less than 1 or when the input does not consist of exactly `n` integers each being 1 or 2. If the input does not meet these requirements, the function's behavior is undefined.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return str(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and prompts the user to input a string. It then returns this string. There are no actions performed on the input string, and no manipulation of any list of number tiles as implied by the initial problem description. This function simply reads user input and returns it.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` reads two lines of input from the standard input. The first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), which represents the number of number tiles in the bag. The second line contains `n` space-separated integers, each being either 1 or 2, representing the values written on the tiles. The function then returns a map object containing these integers. This map object can be iterated over to access the sequence of integers read from the input. Potential edge cases include when `n` is exactly 1 or 200,000, or when the input integers are not strictly 1 or 2, although such cases would result in an error due to the conversion to integers. The function does not handle such errors explicitly, so the caller must ensure valid input.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_4())
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5()` takes no explicit parameters and returns a list generated by `func_4()`. This list is derived from processing `n` space-separated integers (where `n` is between 1 and 200,000) that are either 1 or 2. There are no explicit input parameters mentioned in the provided code, so the value of `n` and the integers themselves are assumed to be part of the input context before the function call. The function does not modify any external variables; it solely relies on the input integers provided in the form of space-separated values and returns the processed list as output. No edge cases or missing functionalities are indicated within the provided code snippet, suggesting that the function operates correctly under the given constraints.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(item):
    return item[0]
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts a parameter `item`, which is either a tuple or a list containing at least one element. It returns the first element of `item`. Since the code only contains a single return statement, the function will always return the first element of `item`, regardless of whether `item` is a tuple or a list. This behavior is consistent with both the annotated code and the return postconditions. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the provided code, and the function does not perform any additional operations beyond returning the first element of `item`.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey)
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts a list `l` of integers, where each integer is either 1 or 2. It then sorts the list in ascending order using the `sorted` function with a custom key (`getKey`), which ensures the sorting is based on the natural order of integers. The function returns a new list of integers that is sorted in ascending order, where each integer remains either 1 or 2. This means that the original list `l` is not modified; instead, a new sorted list is returned. Potential edge cases include an empty list or a list with only one element, which would both result in the same list being returned. Additionally, if `getKey` is not defined or does not work correctly, the sorting might not behave as expected, although the default sorting behavior of integers should handle the case correctly.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. Here, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers representing the dimensions of a 2D list, and `num` is an integer that can be either 1 or 2. After executing, the function returns a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element in the list is the integer `num`. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code, and all potential edge cases are handled by the code itself, as it correctly generates the desired 2D list regardless of the values of `n`, `m`, and `num` (as long as `num` is either 1 or 2).
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns `True` if `x` is 0, otherwise it returns `False`. This function checks whether the given non-negative integer `x` is zero. If `x` is 0, the expression `x and not x & x - 1` evaluates to `True`. For any other non-negative integer value of `x`, the expression evaluates to `False`. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^{200000}\) and returns its binary representation as a string without the '0b' prefix. The function correctly converts the integer to binary and removes the '0b' prefix. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionality in the provided code, as it accurately performs the required operation for all valid inputs within the specified range.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to 200,000, where the binary representation of `n` consists only of the digits 1 and 2. After processing, it returns a list of integers, where each integer is either 1 or 2, representing the binary digits of the original integer `n`. The function correctly handles the conversion of `n` to its binary representation and ensures that only the digits 1 and 2 are present. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself that need special handling beyond the given constraints.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p1
    return res
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where both `x` and `y` are integers, and `p` is a prime number greater than 1. The function computes \( x^y \mod p \) using a fast exponentiation algorithm. After executing the loop, the function returns the result stored in `res`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is as follows:
- `res` contains the value of \( x^y \mod p \).
- `y` is set to 0.
- `x` is updated to \( x^{2^k} \mod p \), where \( k \) is the number of iterations the loop performed.

Potential edge cases:
- If `y` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain 1 regardless of the values of `x` and `p`.

Missing functionality:
- The annotation states that the program returns `res`, which is 1. However, the actual code updates `res` based on the value of `x` and `y` during the loop. Therefore, the correct return value should be `res` instead of always returning 1.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, which are non-negative integers and can only be 1 or 2. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm within a while loop. After the loop completes, the function returns `x` as the GCD and sets `y` to 0. This process works correctly for all valid inputs (i.e., `x` and `y` being 1 or 2), and the final state of the program is that `x` contains the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the provided code.

''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14()` accepts no explicit parameters but relies on values derived from `func_2()` and `func_5()`. It generates a sequence `s` consisting of alternating 1s and 2s based on the counts of 1s and 2s in the list `l`. If the counts of 1s and 2s are equal, it creates a sequence where 1s and 2s alternate starting with 2. Otherwise, it ensures that the sequence starts and ends with the more frequent element, maintaining an alternating pattern. After constructing the sequence `s`, it calls `func_1(*s)`. Potential edge cases include when the list `l` is empty or when the counts of 1s and 2s are equal but the list length is odd. In these cases, the function ensures that the sequence `s` is correctly formed according to the given rules.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
