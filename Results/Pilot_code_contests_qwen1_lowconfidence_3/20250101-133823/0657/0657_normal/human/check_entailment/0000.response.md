Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the number of 1's and 2's are not equal. Hereâ€™s an example to demonstrate this:

### Example Input:
```
5
2 1 2 1 1
```

### Expected Output:
A permutation that maximizes the number of prefix sums being prime numbers. One such valid permutation could be `1 1 2 2 1` which results in the prefix sums: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 (3 primes).

### Program Output:
The program attempts to construct a sequence but does not always produce the correct result. In the given example, the program does not generate a sequence that maximizes the number of prime prefix sums.

### Why It Fails:
- The program tries to use a pre-defined sequence `[1, 1, 1, 2, 2]` repeated multiple times, which does not account for the actual distribution of 1's and 2's in the input.
- It also does not correctly handle cases where the counts of 1's and 2's are different, leading to suboptimal sequences.

### Suggested Fix:
To handle all cases correctly, the program needs to dynamically decide the order of placing 1's and 2's to maximize the number of prime prefix sums. This requires a more sophisticated approach to placement logic, considering the counts of 1's and 2's and strategically placing them to form prime sums.
