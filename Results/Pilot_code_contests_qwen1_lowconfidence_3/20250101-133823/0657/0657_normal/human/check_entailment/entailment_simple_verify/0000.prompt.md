You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We're giving away nice huge bags containing number tiles! A bag we want to present to you contains n tiles. Each of them has a single number written on it — either 1 or 2.

However, there is one condition you must fulfill in order to receive the prize. You will need to put all the tiles from the bag in a sequence, in any order you wish. We will then compute the sums of all prefixes in the sequence, and then count how many of these sums are prime numbers. If you want to keep the prize, you will need to maximize the number of primes you get.

Can you win the prize? Hurry up, the bags are waiting!

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of number tiles in the bag. The following line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i ∈ \{1, 2\}) — the values written on the tiles.

Output

Output a permutation b_1, b_2, ..., b_n of the input sequence (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) maximizing the number of the prefix sums being prime numbers. If there are multiple optimal permutations, output any.

Examples

Input


5
1 2 1 2 1


Output


1 1 1 2 2


Input


9
1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1


Output


1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1

Note

The first solution produces the prefix sums 1, \mathbf{\color{blue}{2}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{3}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{5}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{7}} (four primes constructed), while the prefix sums in the second solution are 1, \mathbf{\color{blue}{2}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{3}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{5}}, 6, \mathbf{\color{blue}{7}}, 8, 10, \mathbf{\color{blue}{11}} (five primes). Primes are marked bold and blue. In each of these cases, the number of produced primes is maximum possible.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the number of 1's and 2's are not equal. Here’s an example to demonstrate this:

### Example Input:
```
5
2 1 2 1 1
```

### Expected Output:
A permutation that maximizes the number of prefix sums being prime numbers. One such valid permutation could be `1 1 2 2 1` which results in the prefix sums: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 (3 primes).

### Program Output:
The program attempts to construct a sequence but does not always produce the correct result. In the given example, the program does not generate a sequence that maximizes the number of prime prefix sums.

### Why It Fails:
- The program tries to use a pre-defined sequence `[1, 1, 1, 2, 2]` repeated multiple times, which does not account for the actual distribution of 1's and 2's in the input.
- It also does not correctly handle cases where the counts of 1's and 2's are different, leading to suboptimal sequences.

### Suggested Fix:
To handle all cases correctly, the program needs to dynamically decide the order of placing 1's and 2's to maximize the number of prime prefix sums. This requires a more sophisticated approach to placement logic, considering the counts of 1's and 2's and strategically placing them to form prime sums.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
