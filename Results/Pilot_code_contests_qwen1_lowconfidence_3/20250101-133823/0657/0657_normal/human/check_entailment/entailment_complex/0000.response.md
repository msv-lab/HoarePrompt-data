Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code does not handle the case where the number of 1s and 2s in the input list is equal and the total number of tiles is odd. 

According to the problem description, if the counts of 1s and 2s are equal, the sequence should start and end with the more frequent element, maintaining an alternating pattern. However, the code provided in the `func_14` function has a conditional block that is commented out:

```python
if two == one:
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            s.append(2)
        else:
            s.append(1)
    print(*s)
    exit()
```

This block is meant to handle the case where the counts of 1s and 2s are equal. Instead, the current implementation of `func_14` uses a different approach:

```python
s = [2]
p = [2]
two -= 1
for i in range(1, n):
    if p[-1] % 2 == 0:
        if one != 0:
            s.append(1)
            p.append(p[-1] + 1)
            one -= 1
        else:
            s.append(2)
            p.append(p[-1] + 2)
            two -= 1
    elif two != 0:
        s.append(2)
        p.append(p[-1] + 2)
        two -= 1
    else:
        s.append(1)
        p.append(p[-1] + 1)
        one -= 1
```

This approach does not handle the case where the counts of 1s and 2s are equal and the total number of tiles is odd. For example, consider the input:

```
3
1 2 1
```

The correct output should be `1 2 1` to maximize the number of prime prefix sums. However, the current code will produce `2 1 2`, which is incorrect because it does not maintain the alternating pattern starting and ending with the more frequent element.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
