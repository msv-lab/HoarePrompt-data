The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. Here, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers representing the dimensions of a 2D list, and `num` is an integer that can be either 1 or 2. After executing, the function returns a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element in the list is the integer `num`. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code, and all potential edge cases are handled by the code itself, as it correctly generates the desired 2D list regardless of the values of `n`, `m`, and `num` (as long as `num` is either 1 or 2).
