The function `func_5()` takes no explicit parameters and returns a list generated by `func_4()`. This list is derived from processing `n` space-separated integers (where `n` is between 1 and 200,000) that are either 1 or 2. There are no explicit input parameters mentioned in the provided code, so the value of `n` and the integers themselves are assumed to be part of the input context before the function call. The function does not modify any external variables; it solely relies on the input integers provided in the form of space-separated values and returns the processed list as output. No edge cases or missing functionalities are indicated within the provided code snippet, suggesting that the function operates correctly under the given constraints.
