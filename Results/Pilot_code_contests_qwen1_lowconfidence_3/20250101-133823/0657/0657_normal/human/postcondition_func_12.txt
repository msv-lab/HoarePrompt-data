The function `func_13` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, which are non-negative integers and can only be 1 or 2. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm within a while loop. After the loop completes, the function returns `x` as the GCD and sets `y` to 0. This process works correctly for all valid inputs (i.e., `x` and `y` being 1 or 2), and the final state of the program is that `x` contains the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the provided code.
