The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of tiles, followed by a line of `n` space-separated integers where each integer is either 1 or 2 representing the values on the tiles. The function then returns these values as a list of integers. There are no additional operations performed on these values within the function. Potential edge cases include when `n` is less than 1 or when the input does not consist of exactly `n` integers each being 1 or 2. If the input does not meet these requirements, the function's behavior is undefined.
