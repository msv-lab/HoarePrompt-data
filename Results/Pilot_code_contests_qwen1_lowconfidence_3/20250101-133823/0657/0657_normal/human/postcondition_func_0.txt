The function `func_1` takes a list `tiles` as input, where each element in the list is either 1 or 2, and the length of the list is between 1 and 200,000 inclusive. It then writes the string representation of each element in `tiles` to a specified output stream (`file`), separated by a separator string (`sep`). The function also handles optional keyword arguments such as `end` (to append to the end of the output), and `flush` (to flush the write buffer). If the `flush` argument is `True`, the write buffer is flushed after the output is written. The function does not modify the original `tiles` list but constructs a new string representation of the list with separators and appends it to the `file`. If no `file` is provided, it defaults to `sys.stdout`.
