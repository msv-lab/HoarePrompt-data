The function `func` accepts a list of integers as input and processes each integer according to specific rules. The function removes elements from the list based on whether they can be halved (if even), tripled (if divisible by 3), or doubled (if present in the list). It maintains a list `res` that records these transformations. After processing all elements, the function prints the contents of `res`. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints a list based on the input list.
