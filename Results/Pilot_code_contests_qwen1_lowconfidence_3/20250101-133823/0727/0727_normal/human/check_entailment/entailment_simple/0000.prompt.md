You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Polycarp likes to play with numbers. He takes some integer number x, writes it down on the board, and then performs with it n - 1 operations of the two kinds: 

  * divide the number x by 3 (x must be divisible by 3); 
  * multiply the number x by 2. 



After each operation, Polycarp writes down the result on the board and replaces x by the result. So there will be n numbers on the board after all.

You are given a sequence of length n — the numbers that Polycarp wrote down. This sequence is given in arbitrary order, i.e. the order of the sequence can mismatch the order of the numbers written on the board.

Your problem is to rearrange (reorder) elements of this sequence in such a way that it can match possible Polycarp's game in the order of the numbers written on the board. I.e. each next number will be exactly two times of the previous number or exactly one third of previous number.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Input

The first line of the input contatins an integer number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of the elements in the sequence. The second line of the input contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^{18}) — rearranged (reordered) sequence that Polycarp can wrote down on the board.

Output

Print n integer numbers — rearranged (reordered) input sequence that can be the sequence that Polycarp could write down on the board.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Examples

Input

6
4 8 6 3 12 9


Output

9 3 6 12 4 8 


Input

4
42 28 84 126


Output

126 42 84 28 


Input

2
1000000000000000000 3000000000000000000


Output

3000000000000000000 1000000000000000000 

Note

In the first example the given sequence can be rearranged in the following way: [9, 3, 6, 12, 4, 8]. It can match possible Polycarp's game which started with x = 9.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:

from string import ascii_lowercase, ascii_uppercase
from fractions import Fraction, gcd
from itertools import product, permutations, combinations
from Queue import Queue, PriorityQueue
from collections import deque, defaultdict, Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input sequence is a list of n integer numbers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and each number a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^{18}.
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    INF = float('+inf')
    if (sys.subversion[0] == 'PyPy') :
        sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()
        atexit.register(lambda : sys.__stdout__.write(sys.stdout.getvalue()))
        sys.stdin = io.BytesIO(sys.stdin.read())
        raw_input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a list of integers between 2 and 100 inclusive, each between 1 and \(3 \cdot 10^{18}\) inclusive; `MOD` is 10; `INF` is positive infinity; if the system subversion starts with 'P' followed by 'y', 'p', and 'y', `sys.stdout` is now `io.BytesIO()`, and the standard input is redirected to an in-memory bytes stream initialized with the existing standard input data; `raw_input` is a lambda function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips any trailing whitespace. If the system subversion does not match this pattern, the state remains unchanged.
    pr = lambda *args: sys.stdout.write(' '.join(str(x) for x in args) + '\n')

            res = [a * 3] + res
            continue
        
        a = res[-1]
        
        if a % 3 == 0 and a / 3 in arr:
            arr.remove(a / 3)
            res = res + [a / 3]

        elif a * 2 in arr:

            res = res + [a * 2]
            continue
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `arr` is an empty set, `res` contains the transformation history of the initial elements based on the given operations. Specifically, each element in `res` is either halved (if it is even and its half is in `arr`), tripled (if it is divisible by 3 and its third is in `arr`), or doubled (if its double is in `arr`). If none of these conditions are met, the original value remains in `res`.
    pr(*res)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
