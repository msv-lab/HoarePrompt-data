Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly rearrange the sequence according to the problem description. Specifically, the code attempts to build the sequence by removing elements from the input list based on certain conditions, but it does not ensure that each number in the final sequence can be obtained from the previous number by either dividing by 3 or multiplying by 2. 

For example, consider the input sequence `[4, 8, 6, 3, 12, 9]`. The correct rearrangement should be `[9, 3, 6, 12, 4, 8]` as each number is either double or triple the previous number. However, the provided code does not guarantee this order. 

Hereâ€™s an issue highlighted by the example:
- The code starts by popping an element and then tries to find either half or triple of the current element in the set. This approach can miss the correct order if the sequence requires a combination of both division by 3 and multiplication by 2 steps.

To fix this, a more systematic approach is needed, such as sorting the sequence and then trying to reconstruct the original sequence using a depth-first search (DFS) or similar method that ensures the order constraints are met.
