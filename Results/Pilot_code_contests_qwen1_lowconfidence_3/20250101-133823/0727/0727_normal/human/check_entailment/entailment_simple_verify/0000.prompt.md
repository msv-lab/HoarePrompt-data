You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp likes to play with numbers. He takes some integer number x, writes it down on the board, and then performs with it n - 1 operations of the two kinds: 

  * divide the number x by 3 (x must be divisible by 3); 
  * multiply the number x by 2. 



After each operation, Polycarp writes down the result on the board and replaces x by the result. So there will be n numbers on the board after all.

You are given a sequence of length n — the numbers that Polycarp wrote down. This sequence is given in arbitrary order, i.e. the order of the sequence can mismatch the order of the numbers written on the board.

Your problem is to rearrange (reorder) elements of this sequence in such a way that it can match possible Polycarp's game in the order of the numbers written on the board. I.e. each next number will be exactly two times of the previous number or exactly one third of previous number.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Input

The first line of the input contatins an integer number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of the elements in the sequence. The second line of the input contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^{18}) — rearranged (reordered) sequence that Polycarp can wrote down on the board.

Output

Print n integer numbers — rearranged (reordered) input sequence that can be the sequence that Polycarp could write down on the board.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Examples

Input

6
4 8 6 3 12 9


Output

9 3 6 12 4 8 


Input

4
42 28 84 126


Output

126 42 84 28 


Input

2
1000000000000000000 3000000000000000000


Output

3000000000000000000 1000000000000000000 

Note

In the first example the given sequence can be rearranged in the following way: [9, 3, 6, 12, 4, 8]. It can match possible Polycarp's game which started with x = 9.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to reorder the sequence to match the rules of Polycarp's game, but it has a logical flaw. Specifically, the program only considers the current element `a` and its direct potential predecessors (i.e., `a / 2` and `a * 3`) without ensuring that these potential predecessors themselves are valid elements of the remaining set. This can lead to situations where the program incorrectly reorders the sequence.

For example, consider the input sequence `[4, 8, 6, 3, 12, 9]`. The correct rearrangement is `[9, 3, 6, 12, 4, 8]`, as shown in the example output. However, the program might fail to find this correct arrangement because it does not properly handle the dependencies between elements.

To illustrate, let's trace the program's behavior with the given input:

1. Start with `res = [9]`.
2. Check `a = 9`: `9 * 2 = 18` is not in the set, and `9 / 3 = 3` is in the set.
3. Add `3` to the beginning: `res = [3, 9]`.
4. Check `a = 3`: `3 * 2 = 6` is in the set.
5. Add `6` to the beginning: `res = [6, 3, 9]`.
6. Check `a = 6`: `6 * 2 = 12` is in the set.
7. Add `12` to the beginning: `res = [12, 6, 3, 9]`.
8. Check `a = 12`: `12 / 2 = 6` is already in the list, so we skip.
9. Check `a = 9`: `9 * 2 = 18` is not in the set, and `9 / 3 = 3` is already in the list, so we skip.

This process results in an incomplete and incorrect sequence. A more robust approach would involve maintaining a graph or a tree structure to ensure that each element can be traced back to its valid predecessor(s).

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
