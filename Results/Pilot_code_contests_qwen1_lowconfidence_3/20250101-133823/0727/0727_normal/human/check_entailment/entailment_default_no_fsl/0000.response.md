Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code does not guarantee that the sequence will be rearranged in the correct order where each next number is either exactly two times or exactly one third of the previous number. Here is a counterexample:

Given input:
```
6
4 8 6 3 12 9
```

The expected output should be:
```
9 3 6 12 4 8
```

However, the provided code might produce an incorrect rearrangement. For instance, consider the sequence `[4, 8, 6, 3, 12, 9]`. The code tries to build the sequence by either doubling or tripling the numbers. However, it does not ensure that the sequence is built correctly step-by-step, which means it might miss some valid rearrangements.

To illustrate, the code might process the numbers in a way that does not guarantee the correct sequence. For example, it might start with `4` and then try to double it to `8`, but it might not properly handle the order to ensure that `9` and `3` are placed correctly relative to each other and the other numbers.

A more robust approach would involve finding the root number (the starting number `x`) and then generating the sequence from that root, ensuring that each step follows the required operations (dividing by 3 or multiplying by 2). This would ensure that the sequence is built correctly for every potential case.
