You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp likes to play with numbers. He takes some integer number x, writes it down on the board, and then performs with it n - 1 operations of the two kinds: 

  * divide the number x by 3 (x must be divisible by 3); 
  * multiply the number x by 2. 



After each operation, Polycarp writes down the result on the board and replaces x by the result. So there will be n numbers on the board after all.

You are given a sequence of length n — the numbers that Polycarp wrote down. This sequence is given in arbitrary order, i.e. the order of the sequence can mismatch the order of the numbers written on the board.

Your problem is to rearrange (reorder) elements of this sequence in such a way that it can match possible Polycarp's game in the order of the numbers written on the board. I.e. each next number will be exactly two times of the previous number or exactly one third of previous number.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Input

The first line of the input contatins an integer number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of the elements in the sequence. The second line of the input contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^{18}) — rearranged (reordered) sequence that Polycarp can wrote down on the board.

Output

Print n integer numbers — rearranged (reordered) input sequence that can be the sequence that Polycarp could write down on the board.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Examples

Input

6
4 8 6 3 12 9


Output

9 3 6 12 4 8 


Input

4
42 28 84 126


Output

126 42 84 28 


Input

2
1000000000000000000 3000000000000000000


Output

3000000000000000000 1000000000000000000 

Note

In the first example the given sequence can be rearranged in the following way: [9, 3, 6, 12, 4, 8]. It can match possible Polycarp's game which started with x = 9.

Output hints: The function `func` accepts a list of integers as input and processes each integer according to specific rules. The function removes elements from the list based on whether they can be halved (if even), tripled (if divisible by 3), or doubled (if present in the list). It maintains a list `res` that records these transformations. After processing all elements, the function prints the contents of `res`. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints a list based on the input list.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
