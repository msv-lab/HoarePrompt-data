The code `arr.remove(a * 2)` attempts to remove the element `a * 2` from the list `arr`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `a` or `arr`. We need to consider the possible outcomes based on whether `a * 2` is in `arr`.

- If `a * 2` is in `arr`, then `arr.remove(a * 2)` will remove that element from `arr`.
- If `a * 2` is not in `arr`, then the operation will raise a `ValueError`.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact content of `arr`, we cannot determine the exact outcome. However, we can state the general behavior.

Output State: **`arr` loses an instance of `a * 2` if `a * 2` was present, otherwise a `ValueError` is raised; `a` is the first element of `res`, and the rest of the elements in `res` are as specified in the initial state.**
