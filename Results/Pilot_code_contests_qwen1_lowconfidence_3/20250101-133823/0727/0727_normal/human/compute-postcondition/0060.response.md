The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop and move to the next iteration. However, the provided code snippet does not indicate which loop the `continue` statement is part of. Since there is no loop, the `continue` statement will cause a syntax error. Given the context, it seems like this might be within a loop structure that was not shown. Without the loop, the variables `a` and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the first element of `res`, and the rest of the elements in `res` are `[r1, r2, ..., a / 3]`**
