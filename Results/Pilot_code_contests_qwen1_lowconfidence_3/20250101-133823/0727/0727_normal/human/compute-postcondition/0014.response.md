The code defines a lambda function `read_ints` which reads a line from `sys.stdin`, splits it into individual strings, and maps them to integers. This does not immediately assign any values to `read_ints` itself, but rather defines what `read_ints` will do when called. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a list of integers between 2 and 100 inclusive, each between 1 and \(3 \cdot 10^{18}\) inclusive; `MOD` is 10; `INF` is positive infinity; `sys.stdout` is now `io.BytesIO()`, and the standard input is redirected to an in-memory bytes stream initialized with the existing standard input data; `read_str` is equivalent to `raw_input`; `raw_input` is a lambda function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips any trailing whitespace; `pr` is a lambda function that writes a space-separated string of arguments to `sys.stdout` followed by a newline; `epr` is a lambda function that writes a space-separated string of arguments to `sys.stderr` followed by a newline; `read_strs` is a lambda function that splits the input string into a list of strings; `read_int` is a lambda function that reads an integer from `sys.stdin` and converts it to an integer; `read_ints` is a lambda function that splits a line read from `sys.stdin` into integers.**
