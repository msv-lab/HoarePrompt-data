The code appends `a * 2` to the list `res`. Given the initial state where `a` is equal to the last element of `res`, and considering the conditions about `a`, the new value of `a` after appending will be `a * 2`. However, since the exact value of `a` was not specified, we know that `a` is not divisible by 3, `a` divided by 3 is not in the set `arr`, and `a * 2` is not in the set `arr`. After appending `a * 2` to `res`, the new value of `a` will be `a * 2`.

Output State: **`arr` is a set of unique integers, `res` is a list where the last element is `a * 2`, `a` is a value that is not divisible by 3, `a / 3` is not in `arr`, and `a * 2` is not in `arr`.**
