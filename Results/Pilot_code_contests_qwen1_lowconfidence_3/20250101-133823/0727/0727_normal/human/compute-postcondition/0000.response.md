The code snippet only defines a constant `MOD` which is set to `10 ** 9 + 7`. This does not affect the values of any other variables in the input sequence. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the `MOD` constant.

Output State: **The input sequence is a list of n integer numbers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and each number a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^{18}; `MOD` is 10 ** 9 + 7.**
