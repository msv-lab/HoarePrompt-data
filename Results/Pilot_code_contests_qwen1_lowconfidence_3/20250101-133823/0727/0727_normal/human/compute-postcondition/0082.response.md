The code `continue` is used in a loop context to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop is specified in the given code snippet, the variables `a` and `res` are not affected by the `continue` statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` references `a * 2`, and `res` is the same list as before except `a * 2` has now been added as the new last element.**
