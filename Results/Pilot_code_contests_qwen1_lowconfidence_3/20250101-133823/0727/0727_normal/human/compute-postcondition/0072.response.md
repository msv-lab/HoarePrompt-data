The code `res = [a * 3] + res` updates the list `res` by adding the element `a * 3` at the beginning of the list. Since `a` is equal to `res[0]`, the first element of `res` before the update is `res[0]`. Therefore, `a * 3` is equivalent to `res[0] * 3`.

Given the precondition that `arr` does not contain `res[0] * 3`, the value of `arr` remains unchanged.

The updated state of `res` is `[a * 3] + res`, which means the first element of `res` is now `a * 3` and the rest of the elements remain the same as before.

Output State: **`a` is equal to `res[0] * 3`, `res` is `[a * 3] + res`, `arr` does not contain `res[0] * 3`.**
