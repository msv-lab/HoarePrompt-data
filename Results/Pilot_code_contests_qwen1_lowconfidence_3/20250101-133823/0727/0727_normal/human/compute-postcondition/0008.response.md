The code defines a lambda function `pr` that writes a space-separated string of arguments to `sys.stdout` followed by a newline. This function does not change the values of any variables, it only affects the way certain outputs are formatted. 

Given the initial state, none of the variables are directly modified by this piece of code. The only change is in the definition of the `pr` function.

Output State: **`n` is a list of integers between 2 and 100 inclusive, each between 1 and \(3 \cdot 10^{18}\) inclusive; `MOD` is 10; `INF` is positive infinity; if the system subversion starts with 'P' followed by 'y', 'p', and 'y', `sys.stdout` is now `io.BytesIO()`, and the standard input is redirected to an in-memory bytes stream initialized with the existing standard input data; `raw_input` is a lambda function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips any trailing whitespace; `pr` is a lambda function that writes a space-separated string of arguments to `sys.stdout` followed by a newline.**
