The code `arr.remove(a * 3)` removes the element `a * 3` from the set `arr`. Given the initial conditions:

- `arr` is a set of unique integers (at least one element).
- `res` is a list containing the last element of the original `arr`.
- `a` is equal to the last element of `arr`.
- `a` is not even, or `a / 2` is not in `arr`.
- `a * 3` is in `arr`.

After removing `a * 3` from `arr`, the following changes occur:
- The value of `arr` will no longer include `a * 3`.
- The values of `res`, `a`, and the condition `a` is not even, or `a / 2` is not in `arr` remain unchanged because the code does not affect these variables.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`arr` is a set of unique integers (excluding `a * 3`), `res` is a list containing the last element of the original `arr`, `a` is equal to the last element of the original `arr`, `a` is not even, or `a / 2` is not in `arr`.**
