Postcondition: **`arr` is a set of unique integers, `res` is a list. If `a % 3 == 0` and `a / 3` is in `arr`, then `arr` does not contain `a / 3` and the last element of `res` is updated to `a / 3`. Otherwise, the last element of `res` is either doubled (`a * 2`) if `a * 2` is in `arr`, or remains `a` if `a * 2` is not in `arr`. `a` is not divisible by 3 and `a / 3` is not in `arr`.**
