The code appends `a * 3` to the beginning of the list `res`. Given that `res` originally contains only the last element of the original `arr`, which is `a`, the new value of `res` will be `[a * 3, a]`. The values of `arr` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a set of unique integers (excluding `a * 3`), `res` is `[a * 3, a]`, `a` is equal to the last element of the original `arr`, `a` is not even, or `a / 2` is not in `arr`.**
