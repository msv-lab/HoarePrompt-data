The code defines a lambda function `epr` which writes a space-separated string of arguments to `sys.stderr` followed by a newline. However, this does not affect any of the existing variables or their values. The only changes are to the definition of `epr`. 

Output State: **`n` is a list of integers between 2 and 100 inclusive, each between 1 and \(3 \cdot 10^{18}\) inclusive; `MOD` is 10; `INF` is positive infinity; if the system subversion starts with 'P' followed by 'y', 'p', and 'y', `sys.stdout` is now `io.BytesIO()`, and the standard input is redirected to an in-memory bytes stream initialized with the existing standard input data; `raw_input` is a lambda function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips any trailing whitespace; `pr` is a lambda function that writes a space-separated string of arguments to `sys.stdout` followed by a newline; `epr` is a lambda function that writes a space-separated string of arguments to `sys.stderr` followed by a newline.**
