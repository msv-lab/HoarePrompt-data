The code assigns the first (and only) element of the list `res` to the variable `a`. Since `res` contains the last element of the original `arr`, and `arr` is a set of unique integers (at least one element), `res` is a list with one element, which is the last element of `arr`. After the assignment, `a` will hold this value.

Output State: **`arr` is a set of unique integers (at least one element); `res` is a list containing the last element of the original `arr`; `a` is equal to the last element of `arr`.**
