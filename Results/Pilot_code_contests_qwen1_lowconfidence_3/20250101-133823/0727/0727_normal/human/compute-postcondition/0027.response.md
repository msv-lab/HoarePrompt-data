The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current loop's body and move to the next iteration of the loop. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`arr` is a set of unique integers with at least one element, excluding `a / 2`; `res` is a list with the first element being `a / 2` and the rest of the elements being the same as in the original `res`; `a` is equal to the last element of the modified `arr` and is an even number; `a / 2` is no longer in `arr`.**
