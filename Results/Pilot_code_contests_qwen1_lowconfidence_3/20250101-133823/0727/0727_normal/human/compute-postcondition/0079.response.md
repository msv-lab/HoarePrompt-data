The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, the value of `a` references the last element of `res`, and `res` is updated to include `a / 3`. However, since the `continue` statement does not alter the values of the variables but rather skips the current iteration, the values of `a` and `res` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`a` references the last element of `res`, `res` is the same list as before but with `a / 3` appended.**
