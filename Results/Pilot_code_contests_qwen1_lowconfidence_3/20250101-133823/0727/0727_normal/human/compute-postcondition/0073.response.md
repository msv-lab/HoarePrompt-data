The `continue` statement in this context does not affect the values of any variables. It simply skips to the next iteration of the loop (if there is one) without changing the values of `a`, `res`, or `arr`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is equal to `res[0] * 3`, `res` is `[a * 3] + res`, `arr` does not contain `res[0] * 3`**
