The code snippet assigns the last element of the list `res` to the variable `a`. This operation does not modify `a` or `res` directly, but it changes the reference of `a` to point to the last element of `res`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is equal to `res[0]`
- `res` is the same list as before

After executing the code:
- `a` now references the last element of `res`

Since the code does not perform any operations that modify `a` or `res`, the only change is in the reference of `a`.

Output State: **`a` references the last element of `res`, and `res` is the same list as before.**
