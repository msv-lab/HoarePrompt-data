Postcondition: ***`arr` is a set of unique integers, `res` is a list containing the last element of the original `arr`, `a` is equal to the last element of the original `arr`, `a` is not even, or `a / 2` is not in `arr`. If `a * 3` is in `arr`, then `res` is updated to include `a * 3` as the first element. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
