The code `arr.remove(a * 3)` removes the element `a * 3` from the list `arr`. Since `a` is the first element of `res`, the value of `a * 3` is not specified directly, but we know that the first element of `res` is `a`. After removing `a * 3` from `arr`, the state of `a` remains unchanged because the code does not reassign `a`. The state of `res` is also unchanged since no operation is performed on `res` itself. Therefore, the only change is in `arr`, which now lacks the element `a * 3`.

Output State: **`a` is the first element of `res`, `res` is an unspecified list, `arr` does not contain `a * 3`**
