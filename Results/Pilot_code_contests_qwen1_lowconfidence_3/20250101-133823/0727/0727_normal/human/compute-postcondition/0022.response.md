State right before the while loop, we have:
- `arr` is a set of unique integers (excluding its last element).
- `res` is a list containing the last element of the original `arr`.

The loop condition is `while arr:`. This means the loop continues as long as `arr` is not empty.

For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` needs to contain at least one element. Since `arr` is described as excluding its last element in the current state, it means that `arr` currently has no elements (it's empty).

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `arr` needs to have at least one element before entering the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `arr` contains at least one element.

State: **`arr` is a set of unique integers (at least one element) and `res` is a list containing the last element of the original `arr`.**
