Postcondition: ***`a` is equal to `res[0]`, and `res` is the same list as before. If `a % 2 == 0` and `a / 2` is in `arr`, then `res` is updated to include `a / 2` at the beginning and `arr` does not contain `a / 2`. Otherwise, `a` is updated to `res[0] * 3`, `res` is updated to `[a * 3] + res`, and `arr` does not contain `a * 3`. If `a * 3` is not in `arr`, the function maintains these states.***
