Output State: **`arr` is an empty set, `res` contains the transformation history of the initial elements based on the given operations. Specifically, each element in `res` is either halved (if it is even and its half is in `arr`), tripled (if it is divisible by 3 and its third is in `arr`), or doubled (if its double is in `arr`). If none of these conditions are met, the original value remains in `res`.**
