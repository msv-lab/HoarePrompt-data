The code defines a new lambda function `read_int` that reads an integer from `sys.stdin` and converts it to an integer using the `int()` function. This does not change the value of `n`, `MOD`, `INF`, `sys.stdout`, `read_str`, `raw_input`, `pr`, `epr`, or `read_strs`. Therefore, the only change is the addition of the `read_int` lambda function.

Output State: **`n` is a list of integers between 2 and 100 inclusive, each between 1 and \(3 \cdot 10^{18}\) inclusive; `MOD` is 10; `INF` is positive infinity; `sys.stdout` is now `io.BytesIO()`, and the standard input is redirected to an in-memory bytes stream initialized with the existing standard input data; `read_str` is equivalent to `raw_input`; `raw_input` is a lambda function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips any trailing whitespace; `pr` is a lambda function that writes a space-separated string of arguments to `sys.stdout` followed by a newline; `epr` is a lambda function that writes a space-separated string of arguments to `sys.stderr` followed by a newline; `read_strs` is a lambda function that splits the input string into a list of strings; `read_int` is a lambda function that reads an integer from `sys.stdin` and converts it to an integer.**
