The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no loop context is provided, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables outside of a loop. The initial conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a set of unique integers, `res` is a list where the last element is `a * 2`, `a` is a value that is not divisible by 3, `a / 3` is not in `arr`, and `a * 2` is not in `arr`.**
