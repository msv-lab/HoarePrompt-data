The given lambda function `read_floats` is defined to read a line from `sys.stdin`, split it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, and then convert each string to a float. This function does not affect any of the other variables directly. It merely defines a new function.

Therefore, the only change is the definition of `read_floats`. The rest of the variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is a list of integers between 2 and 100 inclusive, each between 1 and \(3 \cdot 10^{18}\) inclusive; `MOD` is 10; `INF` is positive infinity; `sys.stdout` is now `io.BytesIO()`, and the standard input is redirected to an in-memory bytes stream initialized with the existing standard input data; `read_str` is equivalent to `raw_input`; `raw_input` is a lambda function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips any trailing whitespace; `pr` is a lambda function that writes a space-separated string of arguments to `sys.stdout` followed by a newline; `epr` is a lambda function that writes a space-separated string of arguments to `sys.stderr` followed by a newline; `read_strs` is a lambda function that splits the input string into a list of strings; `read_int` is a lambda function that reads an integer from `sys.stdin` and converts it to an integer; `read_ints` is a lambda function that splits a line read from `sys.stdin` into integers; `read_float` is a lambda function that reads a float from `sys.stdin` and converts it to a float; `read_floats` is a lambda function that reads a line from `sys.stdin`, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, and then converts each string to a float.**
