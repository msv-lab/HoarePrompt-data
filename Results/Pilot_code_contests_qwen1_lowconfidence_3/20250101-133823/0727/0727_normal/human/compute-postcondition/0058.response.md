The code `arr.remove(a / 3)` attempts to remove the element `a / 3` from the list `arr`. However, based on the initial state, `a` is the first element of `res` and the rest of the elements in `res` are determined by the conditions given. The operation on `arr` does not directly affect the values of `a` or `res`.

Since the removal operation is performed on `arr` and not on `res`, the value of `a` and the structure of `res` remain unchanged. The only change is the potential modification of `arr` if `a / 3` exists in it.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the first element of `res`, and the rest of the elements in `res` are as follows: if `a` is even and `a / 2` is in `arr`, then `a / 2` is the first element of the rest of `res` and the rest of the elements remain the same as the initial elements (excluding `a`). Otherwise, if `a * 3` is in `arr`, then `res` becomes `[a * 3] + res`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged. The list `arr` has had its element `a / 3` removed if it existed.

Output State: **`a` is the first element of `res`, and the rest of the elements in `res` are as follows: if `a` is even and `a / 2` is in `arr`, then `a / 2` is the first element of the rest of `res` and the rest of the elements remain the same as the initial elements (excluding `a`). Otherwise, if `a * 3` is in `arr`, then `res` becomes `[a * 3] + res`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged. `arr` has had its element `a / 3` removed if it existed.**
