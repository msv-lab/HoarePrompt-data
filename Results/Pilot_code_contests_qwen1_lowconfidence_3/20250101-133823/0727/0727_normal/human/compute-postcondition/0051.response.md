The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current loop's body and move to the next iteration. However, there is no loop in the given code snippet, so the behavior of `continue` in this context does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a / 2` is the first element of `res`, and the rest of the elements in `res` are the same as the initial elements (excluding `a`)**
