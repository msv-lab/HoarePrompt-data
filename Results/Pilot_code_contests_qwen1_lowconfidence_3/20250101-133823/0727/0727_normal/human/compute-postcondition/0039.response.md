The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state and the `continue` statement does not inherently change any variable values outside of its context (i.e., a loop), the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a set of unique integers without the element `a / 3`
- `res` is a list containing elements such that the last element is `last_res / 3`
- `a` is equal to the last element of `res`

After executing `continue`, the values of these variables do not change. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`arr` is a set of unique integers without the element `a / 3`, `res` is a list containing elements such that the last element is `last_res / 3`, `a` is equal to the last element of `res`.**
