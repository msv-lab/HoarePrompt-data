The code `arr = read_ints()` reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `arr`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

- `n` is the next integer read from the input.
- `MOD` is 10.
- `INF` is positive infinity.
- `sys.stdout` is now `io.BytesIO()`.
- The standard input is redirected to an in-memory bytes stream initialized with the existing standard input data.
- `read_str` is equivalent to `raw_input`.
- `raw_input` is a lambda function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips any trailing whitespace.
- `pr` is a lambda function that writes a space-separated string of arguments to `sys.stdout` followed by a newline.
- `epr` is a lambda function that writes a space-separated string of arguments to `sys.stderr` followed by a newline.
- `read_strs` is a lambda function that splits the input string into a list of strings.
- `read_int` is a lambda function that reads an integer from `sys.stdin` and converts it to an integer.
- `read_ints` is a lambda function that splits a line read from `sys.stdin` into integers.
- `read_float` is a lambda function that reads a float from `sys.stdin` and converts it to a float.
- `read_floats` is a lambda function that reads a line from `sys.stdin`, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, and then converts each string to a float.

After executing the code, the value of `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, and the other variables remain in their original state.
