The code defines a lambda function `die` which takes any number of arguments, calls `pr(*args)` (which prints the arguments separated by spaces and followed by a newline), and then exits the program with status 0 using `exit(0)`. 

Since the `die` function causes the program to exit immediately, no other operations can occur after its call. Therefore, the variables `n`, `MOD`, `INF`, `sys.stdout`, `raw_input`, `pr`, and `epr` are left unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a list of integers between 2 and 100 inclusive, each between 1 and \(3 \cdot 10^{18}\) inclusive; `MOD` is 10; `INF` is positive infinity; `sys.stdout` is now `io.BytesIO()`, and the standard input is redirected to an in-memory bytes stream initialized with the existing standard input data; `raw_input` is a lambda function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips any trailing whitespace; `pr` is a lambda function that writes a space-separated string of arguments to `sys.stdout` followed by a newline; `epr` is a lambda function that writes a space-separated string of arguments to `sys.stderr` followed by a newline.**
