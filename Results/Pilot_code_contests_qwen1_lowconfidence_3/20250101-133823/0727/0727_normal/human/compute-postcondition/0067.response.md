`a` is assigned the value of the first element of `res`. This means `a` is now equal to `res[0]`. The state of `res` and `arr` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is equal to `res[0]`, `res` is the same as before, and `arr` must not be empty.

Output State: **`a` is equal to `res[0]`, `res` is the same as before, and `arr` must not be empty**
