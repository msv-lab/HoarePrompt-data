The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop, the code simply skips the current iteration, but no variables are updated or changed by the `continue` statement. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is the first element of `res`, `res` is now `[a * 3] + res`, `arr` does not contain `a * 3`**
