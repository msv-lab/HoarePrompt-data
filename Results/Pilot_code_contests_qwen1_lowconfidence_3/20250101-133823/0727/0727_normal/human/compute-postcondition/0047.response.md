To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the current state.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `arr` is a set of unique integers.
- `res` is a list.
- `a` is an integer that is not divisible by 3 and `a / 3` is not in `arr`.

### Loop Condition
The loop continues as long as `arr` is non-empty.

### Loop Body (Omitted)
- If `a % 3 == 0` and `a / 3` is in `arr`, then `arr` does not contain `a / 3` and the last element of `res` is updated to `a / 3`.
- Otherwise, the last element of `res` is either doubled (`a * 2`) if `a * 2` is in `arr`, or remains `a` if `a * 2` is not in `arr`.

### Analysis
For the loop to continue executing, `arr` must remain non-empty. Given the condition in the loop and the current state:

- The loop will terminate when `arr` becomes empty. Since `arr` is non-empty at the end of the previous iteration, the only way for the loop to continue is if `arr` still contains elements after processing `a`.

### Adjustments Needed
Since the loop continues as long as `arr` is non-empty, we need to ensure that `arr` still has elements. The state does not provide specific details about the elements of `arr`, but we know that `arr` must not be empty for the loop to continue.

### Conclusion
The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `arr` is non-empty. To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to maintain this condition.

**State:**
**`arr` must be non-empty**
