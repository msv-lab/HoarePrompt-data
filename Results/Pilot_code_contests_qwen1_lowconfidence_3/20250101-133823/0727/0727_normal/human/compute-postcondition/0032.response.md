The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `arr`, `res`, `a` remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`arr` is a set of unique integers (excluding `a * 3`), `res` is `[a * 3, a]`, `a` is equal to the last element of the original `arr`, `a` is not even, or `a / 2` is not in `arr`.**
