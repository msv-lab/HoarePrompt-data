Postcondition: ***`a` is the first element of `res`. If `a` is divisible by 3 and `a / 3` is in `arr`, then `res` becomes `[a, a / 3] + [r1, r2, ...]` where `[r1, r2, ...]` are the remaining elements of the initial `res` excluding `a`. If `a` is not divisible by 3 or `a / 3` is not in `arr`, and `a * 2` is in `arr`, then `res` becomes `[a, a * 2] + [r1, r2, ...]` where `a * 2` is removed from `arr`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
