The code removes an element from `arr`, specifically the element that is equal to `a * 3`. Since `a` is initially equal to `res[0]`, the element removed from `arr` will be `res[0] * 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is equal to `res[0]`, `res` is the same as before, `arr` does not contain `res[0] * 3`**
