The code `arr = set(arr)` converts the list `arr` into a set, removing duplicate elements. Since sets do not allow duplicates, the unique elements from the original list `arr` (excluding its last element) are stored in the new set. The list `res` remains unchanged and still contains the last element of the original `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a set of unique integers (excluding its last element); `res` is a list containing the last element of the original `arr`.**
