The code `res = [arr.pop()]` impacts the program by removing the last element from the list `arr` and assigning it to the list `res`. The previous value of `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, and the previous value of `res` is undefined.

After executing the code:
- The last element of `arr` is removed.
- `res` is assigned a list containing that last element of `arr`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers read from the input, excluding its last element; `res` is a list containing the last element of `arr`**
