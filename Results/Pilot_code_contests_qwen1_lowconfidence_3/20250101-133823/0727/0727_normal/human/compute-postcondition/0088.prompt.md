You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input sequence is a list of n integer numbers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and each number a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^{18}.
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

        sys.stdin = io.BytesIO(sys.stdin.read())
        raw_input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a list of integers between 2 and 100 inclusive, each between 1 and \(3 \cdot 10^{18}\) inclusive; `MOD` is 10; `INF` is positive infinity; if the system subversion starts with 'P' followed by 'y', 'p', and 'y', `sys.stdout` is now `io.BytesIO()`, and the standard input is redirected to an in-memory bytes stream initialized with the existing standard input data; `raw_input` is a lambda function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips any trailing whitespace. If the system subversion does not match this pattern, the state remains unchanged.
    pr = lambda *args: sys.stdout.write(' '.join(str(x) for x in args) + '\n')

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `arr` is an empty set, `res` contains the transformation history of the initial elements based on the given operations. Specifically, each element in `res` is either halved (if it is even and its half is in `arr`), tripled (if it is divisible by 3 and its third is in `arr`), or doubled (if its double is in `arr`). If none of these conditions are met, the original value remains in `res`.
    pr(*res)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a list of n integer numbers. The length of the list satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each number in the list a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^{18}. The function has two possible return cases:
#- Case_1: The function returns the sum of all the integers in the list.
#- Case_2: The function returns an error message indicating that the input does not meet the specified constraints.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list of integers and return either the sum of the integers in the list or an error message based on the specified constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
