The `continue` statement in this context will skip the rest of the loop body and move to the next iteration without making any changes to the variables `arr`, `a`, or `res`. The states of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`arr` loses an instance of `a * 2` if `a * 2` was present, otherwise a `ValueError` is raised; `a` is the first element of `res`, `res` is now `[a, a * 2]`**
