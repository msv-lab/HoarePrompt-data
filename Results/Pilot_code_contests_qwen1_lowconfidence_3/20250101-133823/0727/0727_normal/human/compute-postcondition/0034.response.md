Postcondition: ***`arr` is a set of unique integers with at least one element. `res` is a list. If `a` is an even number and `a / 2` is in `arr`, then `arr` is modified such that `a / 2` is removed and `res` is updated to contain `a / 2` as the first element, with the rest of the elements remaining the same as the original `res`. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged and `res` either includes `a * 3` as the first element if `a * 3` is in `arr`, or remains unchanged with the last element of the original `arr`. `a` is equal to the last element of the modified `arr`.***
