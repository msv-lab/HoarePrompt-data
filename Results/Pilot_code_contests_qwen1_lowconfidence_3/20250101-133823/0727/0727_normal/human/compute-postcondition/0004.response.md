The code registers a function using `atexit.register`. This function is a lambda that writes the content of `sys.stdout` to `sys.__stdout__` using `sys.__stdout__.write(sys.stdout.getvalue())`. However, this does not immediately change any variable values or the state of the program; it only schedules the function to run when the script exits.

Therefore, the variables `n`, `MOD`, `INF`, and the system subversion remain unchanged. The state of `sys.stdout` being `io.BytesIO()` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a list of integers between 2 and 100 inclusive, each between 1 and 3â‹…10^{18} inclusive; `MOD` is 10; `INF` is positive infinity; the current system subversion starts with 'P' followed by 'y', 'p', and 'y'; `sys.stdout` is now `io.BytesIO()`; a function is registered to run at exit.**
