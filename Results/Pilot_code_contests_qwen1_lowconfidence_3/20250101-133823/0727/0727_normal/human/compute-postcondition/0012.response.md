The code defines a lambda function `read_strs` which splits the input string into a list of strings. However, this does not affect any of the existing variables or their values. The lambda function itself is not assigned to any variable, so no new variable is created or modified. The states of all the existing variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a list of integers between 2 and 100 inclusive, each between 1 and \(3 \cdot 10^{18}\) inclusive; `MOD` is 10; `INF` is positive infinity; `sys.stdout` is now `io.BytesIO()`, and the standard input is redirected to an in-memory bytes stream initialized with the existing standard input data; `read_str` is equivalent to `raw_input`; `raw_input` is a lambda function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips any trailing whitespace; `pr` is a lambda function that writes a space-separated string of arguments to `sys.stdout` followed by a newline; `epr` is a lambda function that writes a space-separated string of arguments to `sys.stderr` followed by a newline; `read_strs` is a lambda function that splits the input string into a list of strings.**
