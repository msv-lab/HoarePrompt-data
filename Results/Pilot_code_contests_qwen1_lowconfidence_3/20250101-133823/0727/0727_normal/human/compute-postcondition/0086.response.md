The provided code `pr(*res)` calls the function `pr` with all elements of `res` as arguments. However, since `res` is defined as containing the transformation history of the initial elements based on the given operations and `arr` is initially an empty set, no transformations can occur because there are no elements in `arr` to compare against. Thus, `res` remains empty.

Output State: **`arr` is an empty set, `res` is an empty set**
