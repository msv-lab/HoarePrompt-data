`a` is initially equal to `res[0]`. The value of `a` is therefore the first element of `res`. The value of `res` remains unchanged. `arr` is not empty. The code removes `a / 2` from `arr`.

For the removal to occur, `a / 2` must be an element of `arr`. After the removal, the value of `arr` will no longer include `a / 2`.

Output State: **`a` is equal to `res[0]`, `res` is the same as before, `arr` does not contain `a / 2`**
