`read_str` is assigned the value of `raw_input`. This changes the value of `read_str` from being `None` (its default value when not defined) to being equivalent to the `raw_input` function. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a list of integers between 2 and 100 inclusive, each between 1 and \(3 \cdot 10^{18}\) inclusive; `MOD` is 10; `INF` is positive infinity; `sys.stdout` is now `io.BytesIO()`, and the standard input is redirected to an in-memory bytes stream initialized with the existing standard input data; `read_str` is equivalent to `raw_input`; `raw_input` is a lambda function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips any trailing whitespace; `pr` is a lambda function that writes a space-separated string of arguments to `sys.stdout` followed by a newline; `epr` is a lambda function that writes a space-separated string of arguments to `sys.stderr` followed by a newline.**
