`a` is equal to the last element of `res`, and `a` is divisible by 3 with the result of `a / 3` being an element in `arr`. The code removes `a / 3` from `arr`. The state of `res` and the value of `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a set of unique integers without the element `a / 3`, `res` is a list, `a` is equal to the last element of `res`, and `a` is divisible by 3.

Output State: **`arr` is a set of unique integers without the element `a / 3`, `res` is a list, `a` is equal to the last element of `res`, and `a` is divisible by 3.**
