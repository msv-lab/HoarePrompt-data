The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the execution of the program simply moves to the next line after the `continue` statement without changing any variable values. The states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is equal to `res[0]`, `res` is the same list as before with the addition of `a / 2` at the beginning, `arr` does not contain `a / 2`**
