Postcondition: ***`n` is a list of integers between 2 and 100 inclusive, each between 1 and \(3 \cdot 10^{18}\) inclusive; `MOD` is 10; `INF` is positive infinity; if the system subversion starts with 'P' followed by 'y', 'p', and 'y', `sys.stdout` is now `io.BytesIO()`, and the standard input is redirected to an in-memory bytes stream initialized with the existing standard input data; `raw_input` is a lambda function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips any trailing whitespace. If the system subversion does not match this pattern, the state remains unchanged.***
