The code snippet `sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()` changes the output stream to `io.BytesIO`, which is used for in-memory binary streams. This does not modify the values of the variables `n`, `MOD`, `INF`, or the system subversion string. The only change is that the output will now be directed to an in-memory buffer rather than the standard output.

Output State: **`n` is a list of integers between 2 and 100 inclusive, each between 1 and 3â‹…10^{18} inclusive; `MOD` is 10; `INF` is positive infinity; the current system subversion starts with 'P' followed by 'y', 'p', and 'y'; sys.stdout is now io.BytesIO()**
