`res` is updated by appending `a * 2` to itself. Since `a` is the first element of `res`, `a * 2` will be added to `res`. The initial state of `arr` is not directly affected by this operation, but it's mentioned that `arr` loses an instance of `a * 2` if it was present, otherwise a `ValueError` is raised. However, since the code snippet only modifies `res` and does not check if `a * 2` is in `arr`, the precondition related to `arr` remains unchanged unless explicitly triggered.

Therefore, the updated state of `res` is `res = [a, a * 2]` (assuming `res` initially contained `[a]`).

Output State: **`arr` loses an instance of `a * 2` if `a * 2` was present, otherwise a `ValueError` is raised; `a` is the first element of `res`, `res` is now `[a, a * 2]`**
