In the initial state, `a` references the last element of `res`, and `res` is a list.

The code `arr.remove(a / 3)` removes the first occurrence of `a / 3` from the list `arr`. Since `a` references the last element of `res`, `a / 3` might or might not be in the list `arr`. However, since `a` is the last element of `res`, the operation `a / 3` is performed, but the exact value of `a / 3` is not specified, so we cannot determine if this value exists in `arr`.

Therefore, after executing the code, `a` still references the last element of `res`, and the state of `res` changes if `a / 3` was present in `arr`.

Output State: **`a` references the last element of `res`, `res` is the same list as before but with the first occurrence of `a / 3` removed if it was present.**
