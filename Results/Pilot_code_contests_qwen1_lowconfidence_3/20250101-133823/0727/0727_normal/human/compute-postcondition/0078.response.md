`res` is modified by appending `a / 3` to it. Since `a` references the last element of `res` before the operation, `a` remains unchanged, but `res` now includes `a / 3`. The initial state of `a` referencing the last element of `res` is preserved.

Output State: **`a` references the last element of `res`, `res` is the same list as before but with `a / 3` appended.**
