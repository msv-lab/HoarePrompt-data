Functionality: **The function `func` accepts a list of integers as input and processes each integer according to specific rules. The function removes elements from the list based on whether they can be halved (if even), tripled (if divisible by 3), or doubled (if present in the list). It maintains a list `res` that records these transformations. After processing all elements, the function prints the contents of `res`. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints a list based on the input list.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that the input list `arr` is processed in a way that it removes elements from the set `arr` as it transforms them into other values and appends these new values to `res`. This means that if an element cannot be transformed (i.e., neither halved, tripled, nor doubled), it remains in `arr` until no more transformations can be made, at which point `arr` becomes empty.
- There are no explicit checks for edge cases such as when the input list is empty or when the input list contains non-integer values. While the function uses `read_int` to read the input, it does not validate that the input is strictly a list of integers within the specified range.
- The function does not handle cases where the input list exceeds the specified length constraint (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) or where the integers exceed the specified range (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^{18}). These edge cases should be handled to ensure the function behaves correctly under all circumstances.
