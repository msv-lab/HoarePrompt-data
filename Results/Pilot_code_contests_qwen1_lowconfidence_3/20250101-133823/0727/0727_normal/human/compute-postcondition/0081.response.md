`res` is modified by appending `a * 2` to the end of the list. The initial state indicates that `a` references the new last element of `res` before the operation. After appending `a * 2`, `a * 2` becomes the new last element of `res`. The other parts of the list remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` references `a * 2`, and `res` is the same list as before except `a * 2` has now been added as the new last element.**
