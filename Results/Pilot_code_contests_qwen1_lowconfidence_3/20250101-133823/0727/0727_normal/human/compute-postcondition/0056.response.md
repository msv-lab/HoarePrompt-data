Postcondition: **`a` is the first element of `res`, and the rest of the elements in `res` are as follows: if `a` is even and `a / 2` is in `arr`, then `a / 2` is the first element of the rest of `res` and the rest of the elements remain the same as the initial elements (excluding `a`). Otherwise, if `a * 3` is in `arr`, then `res` becomes `[a * 3] + res`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged.**
