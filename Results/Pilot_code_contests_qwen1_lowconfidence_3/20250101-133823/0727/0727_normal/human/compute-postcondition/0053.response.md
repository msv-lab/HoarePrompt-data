`res` is updated to include `a * 3` as the first element followed by the original elements of `res`. The variable `arr` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the first element of `res`, `res` is now `[a * 3] + res`, `arr` does not contain `a * 3`.

Output State: **`a` is the first element of `res`, `res` is now `[a * 3] + res`, `arr` does not contain `a * 3`**
