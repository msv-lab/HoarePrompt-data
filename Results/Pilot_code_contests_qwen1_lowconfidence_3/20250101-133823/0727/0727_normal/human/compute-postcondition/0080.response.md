`a` references the last element of `res`, and `res` is a list. The code removes `a * 2` from `res`. Since `a` references the last element of `res`, `a * 2` needs to be found in `res` and removed. However, without knowing the exact content of `res`, we cannot specify the exact elements. After the removal, `a` will reference the new last element of `res`.

Output State: **`a` references the new last element of `res`, and `res` is the same list as before except `a * 2` has been removed.**
