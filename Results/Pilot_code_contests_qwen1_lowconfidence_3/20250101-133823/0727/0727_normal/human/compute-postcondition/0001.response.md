The code `INF = float('+inf')` assigns the value of positive infinity to the variable `INF`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `MOD`, or the input sequence. Therefore, the only change is in the introduction of the new variable `INF`.

Output State: **`n` is a list of integers between 2 and 100 inclusive, each between 1 and 3â‹…10^{18} inclusive; `MOD` is 10; `INF` is positive infinity**
