Postcondition: **`a` references the last element of `res`, and `res` is the same list as before. If `a % 3 == 0` and `a / 3` is in `arr`, then `a / 3` is appended to `res`. Otherwise, if `a * 2` is in `arr`, then `a * 2` becomes the new last element of `res`. If neither condition is met, `res` remains unchanged.**
