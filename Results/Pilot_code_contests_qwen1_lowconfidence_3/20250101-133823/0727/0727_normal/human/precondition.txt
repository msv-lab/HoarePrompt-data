The input is a list of n integer numbers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each number is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^{18}. The sequence is given in an arbitrary order but it is guaranteed that the sequence can be rearranged to follow the rules of the game described (each next number is exactly two times of the previous number or exactly one third of the previous number).
