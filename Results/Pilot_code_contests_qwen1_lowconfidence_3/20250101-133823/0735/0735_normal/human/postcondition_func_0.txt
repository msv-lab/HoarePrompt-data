The function takes two lists `A` and `B` of length `N` (where `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`), with elements `A_i` ranging from `0` to `10^9` and `B_i` ranging from `1` to `10^9`. It calculates the minimum number of increments needed to ensure that for every pair `(a, b)` in the lists, `(a + cnt) % b == 0`, where `cnt` starts at `0`. The function iterates through the lists in reverse order, updating `cnt` when necessary. After the loop, the function prints the final value of `cnt`.
