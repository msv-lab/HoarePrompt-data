The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, the `continue` statement itself does not change the values of any variables. It only affects the control flow of the loop. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\),
- `i` is `n-2`,
- `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple containing two integers,
- `cnt` is `b - a % b`,
- `a` is the first element of the tuple at position `n-2` in `ab`,
- `b` is the second element of the same tuple.

After executing `continue`, the values of these variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is `n-2`, `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple containing two integers, `cnt` is `b - a % b`, `a` is the first element of the tuple at position `n-2` in `ab`, `b` is the second element of the same tuple.**
