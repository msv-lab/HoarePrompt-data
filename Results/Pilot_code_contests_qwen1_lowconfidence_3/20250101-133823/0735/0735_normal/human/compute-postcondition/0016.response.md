The code `continue` does not affect any variables or change their values. It only moves to the next iteration of the loop it is inside. Since no variables are modified, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` remains the same; `i` is `n-3`; `ab` remains a list of `n` tuples, each containing two integers; `cnt` remains the updated value based on the condition; `a` is the first element of the tuple at position `n-3` in `ab`; `b` is the second element of the same tuple.**
