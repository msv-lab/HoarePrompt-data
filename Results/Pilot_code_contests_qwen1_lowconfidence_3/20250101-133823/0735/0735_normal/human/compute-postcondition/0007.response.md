Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is `n-1`, `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple containing two integers, `cnt` is 0, `a` is the first element of the last tuple in `ab`, `b` is the second element of the last tuple in `ab`, and if \((a + cnt) \% b == 0\), the loop continues to the next iteration; otherwise, the loop does not change any variables' states.***
