The code assigns the first element of the tuple at index `i` in the list `ab` to `a` and the second element of the same tuple to `b`. Since `i` is defined as `n-2`, we know the exact value of `i`. The values of `n`, `ab`, `cnt`, and `a` (the first element of the last tuple in `ab`) remain unchanged.

Given `i = n - 2`, the tuple `ab[i]` is the tuple at position `n-2` in the list `ab`. Let's denote this tuple as `(x, y)`, where `x` is assigned to `a` and `y` is assigned to `b`.

So, after executing the code:
- `a` is set to the first element of the tuple at position `n-2` in `ab`.
- `b` is set to the second element of the same tuple.

The output state is:
**`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is `n-2`, `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple containing two integers, `cnt` is `b - a % b`, `a` is the first element of the tuple at position `n-2` in `ab`, `b` is the second element of the same tuple.**
