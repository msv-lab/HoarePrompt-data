Functionality: **The function takes two lists `A` and `B` of length `N` (where `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`), with elements `A_i` ranging from `0` to `10^9` and `B_i` ranging from `1` to `10^9`. It calculates the minimum number of increments needed to ensure that for every pair `(a, b)` in the lists, `(a + cnt) % b == 0`, where `cnt` starts at `0`. The function iterates through the lists in reverse order, updating `cnt` when necessary. After the loop, the function prints the final value of `cnt`.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `N` is `0` or negative, the function does not handle this case, although it is assumed that `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`.
- The function assumes valid inputs for `A` and `B` based on their constraints. However, no checks are performed to ensure these constraints are met.
- The function does not handle cases where `b` is `0`, which would cause a division by zero error. While the annotation mentions `1 ≤ B_i ≤ 10^9`, the code itself does not check for `b` being `0`.
- The function does not handle non-integer values in the input, assuming valid integer inputs based on the constraints.
