`i` is assigned the value `n-1`, `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple containing two integers, and `cnt` is 0. The code `a, b = ab[i][0], ab[i][1]` fetches the first and second elements from the tuple at index `i` in the list `ab`. Since `i` is `n-1`, the code fetches the first and second elements from the last tuple in the list `ab`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is `n-1`, `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple containing two integers, `cnt` is 0, `a` is the first element of the last tuple in `ab`, `b` is the second element of the last tuple in `ab`**
