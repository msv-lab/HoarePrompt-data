The `continue` statement in the given code does not change the value of any variable or affect the state of the program beyond breaking out of the current iteration of a loop (which is not specified here). Given that no loop is mentioned and the `continue` statement itself does not modify any variables, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is `n-1`, `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple containing two integers, `cnt` is 0, `a` is the first element of the last tuple in `ab`, `b` is the second element of the last tuple in `ab`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop (if there is one).**
