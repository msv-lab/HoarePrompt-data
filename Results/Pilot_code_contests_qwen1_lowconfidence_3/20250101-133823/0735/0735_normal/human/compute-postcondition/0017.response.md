Postcondition: ***`n` remains the same; `i` is `n-3`; `ab` remains a list of `n` tuples, each containing two integers; `cnt` remains the updated value based on the condition; `a` is the first element of the tuple at position `n-3` in `ab`; `b` is the second element of the same tuple. If `(a + cnt) % b == 0`, the condition holds true. If not, the condition does not hold.***
