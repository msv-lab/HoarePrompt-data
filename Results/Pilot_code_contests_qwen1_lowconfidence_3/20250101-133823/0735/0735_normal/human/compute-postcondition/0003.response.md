According to the code, the loop will execute if the variable `i` starts from `n-1` and decrements to 0. The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple containing two integers
- `cnt` is 0

For the loop to execute:
1. The value of `i` must start from `n-1`.
2. The loop should decrement `i` until `i` reaches 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions:
- `i` should start from `n-1`.
- `n` must be within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is `n-1`, `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple containing two integers, `cnt` is 0**
