The code `print(cnt)` simply prints the value of the variable `cnt`. Since there is no assignment or modification of `cnt` before the print statement, the value of `cnt` remains unchanged. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `ab`, `a`, and `b`) are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is -1, `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple containing two integers, `cnt` is the final updated value after all iterations, `a` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` (which is out of bounds, so it doesn't matter), `b` is the second element of the same tuple (also out of bounds).**
