Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is `n-2`, `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple containing two integers, `cnt` is `b - a % b`, `a` is the first element of the tuple at position `n-2` in `ab`, `b` is the second element of the same tuple. If `(a + cnt) % b == 0`, then `cnt` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cnt` is updated to `b - a % b`.***
