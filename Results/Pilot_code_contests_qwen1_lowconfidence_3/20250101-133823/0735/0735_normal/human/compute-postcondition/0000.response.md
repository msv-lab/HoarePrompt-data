`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`. The raw_input function reads a line from input, converts it to a string, and returns it. The `int` function then converts this string to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), the value of `n` will also fall within this range.

The lists `A` and `B` remain unchanged, and their lengths are still \(N\).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `A` and `B` are lists of length `n`; each `A_i` and `B_i` are integers such that \(0 \leq A_i \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq B_i \leq 10^9\)**.
