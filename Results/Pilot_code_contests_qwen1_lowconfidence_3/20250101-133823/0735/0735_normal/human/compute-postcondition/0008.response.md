`cnt` is incremented by `b - (a + cnt) % b`. Given the precondition, let's analyze the impact:

1. Initially, `cnt` is 0.
2. `(a + cnt) % b` is evaluated. Since `cnt` is 0, this simplifies to `a % b`.
3. The expression `b - (a + cnt) % b` simplifies to `b - a % b`.

Since `a` is the first element of the last tuple in `ab`, and `b` is the second element of the last tuple in `ab`, we know that `a % b` will be a value between 0 and `b-1`. Therefore, `b - a % b` will be a non-negative value less than `b`.

After adding this value to `cnt`, `cnt` will become `b - a % b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is `n-1`, `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple containing two integers, `cnt` is `b - a % b`, `a` is the first element of the last tuple in `ab`, `b` is the second element of the last tuple in `ab`.**
