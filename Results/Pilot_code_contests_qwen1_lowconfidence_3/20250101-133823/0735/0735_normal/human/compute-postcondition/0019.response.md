Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is \(-1\), `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple containing two integers, `cnt` is the final updated value after all iterations, `a` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` (which is out of bounds, so it doesn't matter), `b` is the second element of the same tuple (also out of bounds).**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs in reverse order from \(n-1\) down to 0. After the loop completes, `i` will be \(-1\) because it starts from `n-1` and decrements by 1 each time until it reaches \(-1\).

2. **Updating `cnt`**: For each iteration, `cnt` is updated based on the condition `(a + cnt) % b == 0`. If the condition is not met, `cnt` is incremented by `b - (a + cnt) % b`.

3. **Final Value of `cnt`**: After all iterations, `cnt` will hold the final value that satisfies the condition for all tuples in `ab`. This is because the loop ensures that the condition `(a + cnt) % b == 0` is met for every tuple in the list.

4. **Values of `a` and `b`**: At the end of the loop, `a` and `b` refer to the elements of the tuple at index `i`, which is out of bounds since `i` is now \(-1\). However, these values do not affect the final value of `cnt`.

Thus, the final state of the program after the loop has executed is that `n` remains within the specified range, `i` is \(-1\), `ab` remains the same list of tuples, and `cnt` is the final updated value after all iterations of the loop.
