The code snippet reads `n` lines of input, where each line contains two space-separated integers, and stores them as a list of tuples. Each tuple corresponds to the elements read from one line of input.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The initial state defines that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
2. `A` and `B` are lists of length `n`.
3. `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple `(A_i, B_i)` is created from the integers read from each line of input.

Since the actual values of `A` and `B` are not specified and we cannot determine their exact values without additional input, we only know that `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple containing two integers.**
