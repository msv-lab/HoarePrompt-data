Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple containing two integers.
   - `cnt` is `b - a % b`, where `a` is the first element of the last tuple in `ab` and `b` is the second element of the last tuple in `ab`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in xrange(n - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts with `i` as `n-1` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` becomes -1.
   - This means the loop will run `n` times, starting from `n-1` down to 0.

4. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since the loop is decrementing `i` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be one less than its current value.
   - Therefore, if `i` was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `n-2` at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Remaining States:**
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `ab` remains unchanged.
   - `cnt` remains unchanged because it is determined by the last tuple in `ab`, which does not change within the loop.

6. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n-2`.
   - `n` is still an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `ab` is still a list of `n` tuples, each tuple containing two integers.
   - `cnt` is still `b - a % b`, where `a` is the first element of the last tuple in `ab` and `b` is the second element of the last tuple in `ab`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is `n-2`, `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple containing two integers, `cnt` is `b - a % b`, `a` is the first element of the last tuple in `ab`, `b` is the second element of the last tuple in `ab`.**
