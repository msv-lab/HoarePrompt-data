Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
   - `i` is `n-2`
   - `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple containing two integers
   - `cnt` is `b - a % b`
   - `a` is the first element of the tuple at position `n-2` in `ab`
   - `b` is the second element of the same tuple

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   cnt += b - (a + cnt) % b
   ```

3. **Impact Analysis**:
   - The variable `cnt` is being updated. The new value of `cnt` is the old value of `cnt` plus `b - (a + cnt) % b`.
   - We need to determine what `b - (a + cnt) % b` evaluates to.

4. **Calculating the New Value of `cnt`**:
   - Letâ€™s denote the current value of `cnt` as `old_cnt`.
   - The expression `b - (a + old_cnt) % b` will give us the difference between `b` and the remainder when `a + old_cnt` is divided by `b`.
   - This can be simplified as follows:
     - `(a + old_cnt) % b` gives the remainder when `a + old_cnt` is divided by `b`.
     - If `(a + old_cnt) % b == 0`, then `b - (a + old_cnt) % b` is simply `b`.
     - If `(a + old_cnt) % b != 0`, then `b - (a + old_cnt) % b` is the complement of the remainder in `b`.

5. **Final Value of `cnt`**:
   - The new value of `cnt` will be `old_cnt + b - (a + old_cnt) % b`.
   - Simplifying this:
     - If `(a + old_cnt) % b == 0`, then `cnt = old_cnt + b`.
     - If `(a + old_cnt) % b != 0`, then `cnt = old_cnt + b - (a + old_cnt) % b`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not specified, we express the final value of `cnt` in terms of these variables and the condition:

- If `(a + cnt) % b == 0`, then `cnt` remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, `cnt` is updated to `b - a % b`.

Given the conditions, the output state after the code execution is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `i` is `n-2`; `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple containing two integers; `cnt` is the updated value based on the condition `(a + cnt) % b == 0` or `b - a % b` if the condition is not met; `a` is the first element of the tuple at position `n-2` in `ab`; `b` is the second element of the same tuple.**
