Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `i` is `n-2`.
   - `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each containing two integers.
   - `cnt` is the updated value based on the condition \((a + cnt) \% b == 0\) or `b - a \% b` if the condition is not met.
   - `a` is the first element of the tuple at position `n-2` in `ab`.
   - `b` is the second element of the same tuple.

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `n-1` down to `-1` with a step of `-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n-2`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decreased by 1 (since the loop increments `i` towards `-1`).
   - Therefore, `i` should now be `n-3`.

4. **Updating Other Variables:**
   - The variables `ab`, `cnt`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but there is no mention of such modifications in the problem statement.

Given these points, we can summarize the required adjustments:

**State:**
- `n` remains the same.
- `i` is now `n-3`.
- `ab` remains a list of `n` tuples, each containing two integers.
- `cnt` remains the updated value based on the condition.
- `a` remains the first element of the tuple at position `n-3` in `ab`.
- `b` remains the second element of the same tuple.

So, the final state before the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `i` is `n-3`; `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple containing two integers; `cnt` is the updated value based on the condition \((a + cnt) \% b == 0\) or `b - a \% b` if the condition is not met; `a` is the first element of the tuple at position `n-3` in `ab`; `b` is the second element of the same tuple.**
