Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is `n-1`, `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple containing two integers, `cnt` is 0, `a` is the first element of the last tuple in `ab`, `b` is the second element of the last tuple in `ab`. The condition `(a + cnt) % b == 0` holds true.**
