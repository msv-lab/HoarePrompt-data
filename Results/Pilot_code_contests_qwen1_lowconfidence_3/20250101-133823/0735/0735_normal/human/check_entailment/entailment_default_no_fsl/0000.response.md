Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code iterates through the list in reverse order, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The problem requires pressing buttons from the first through the i-th term, not from the last to the first. This means the code should iterate from 0 to N-1 instead of N-1 to 0.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
3 5
2 7
9 4
```

The correct approach would be to start from the first element and incrementally ensure that each `A_i` is a multiple of `B_i` by pressing the required number of buttons up to the current index. The provided code fails to do this and instead tries to adjust the count in reverse, which leads to an incorrect solution.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ab = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = ab[i]
        if (a + cnt) % b != 0:
            cnt += b - (a + cnt) % b
    print(cnt)
```

This corrected code iterates from the beginning to the end, ensuring that each `A_i` is adjusted correctly to be a multiple of `B_i` by the time it reaches the current index `i`.
