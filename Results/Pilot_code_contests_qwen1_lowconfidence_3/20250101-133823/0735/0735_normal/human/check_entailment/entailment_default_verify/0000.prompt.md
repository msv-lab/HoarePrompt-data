You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are an integer sequence A_1,...,A_N consisting of N terms, and N buttons. When the i-th (1 ≦ i ≦ N) button is pressed, the values of the i terms from the first through the i-th are all incremented by 1.

There is also another integer sequence B_1,...,B_N. Takahashi will push the buttons some number of times so that for every i, A_i will be a multiple of B_i.

Find the minimum number of times Takahashi will press the buttons.

Constraints

* All input values are integers.
* 1 ≦ N ≦ 10^5
* 0 ≦ A_i ≦ 10^9(1 ≦ i ≦ N)
* 1 ≦ B_i ≦ 10^9(1 ≦ i ≦ N)

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 B_1

Output

Print an integer representing the minimum number of times Takahashi will press the buttons.

    ab = [map(int, raw_input().split()) for _ in xrange(n)]
    cnt = 0
    for i in xrange(n - 1, -1, -1):
        (a, b) = (ab[i][0], ab[i][1])
        if (a + cnt) % b == 0:
            continue
        cnt += b - (a + cnt) % b
    print(cnt)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of button presses required to make each \(A_i\) a multiple of \(B_i\). Specifically, the loop starts from the last element and works its way backwards, which can lead to incorrect results.

Consider the following example:
Input:
```
3
3 5
2 7
9 4
```

Expected Output:
```
7
```

However, the program's logic does not correctly handle this scenario. Let's manually go through the steps:

1. For \(i = 2\): \(A_2 = 2\), \(B_2 = 7\). To make \(A_2\) a multiple of \(B_2\), we need to increment \(A_2\) by 5 (since \(2 + 5 = 7\)). So, the increment for \(A_2\) is 5.
2. For \(i = 1\): \(A_1 = 3\), \(B_1 = 5\). After incrementing \(A_2\) by 5, the sequence becomes \([3, 7, 9]\). Now, to make \(A_1\) a multiple of \(B_1\), we need to increment \(A_1\) by 2 (since \(3 + 2 = 5\)). So, the increment for \(A_1\) is 2.

The total number of button presses required is \(5 + 2 = 7\), which matches the expected output.

However, the program's logic starts from the end and only considers the current value without accounting for future increments. This leads to incorrect results in some cases. For instance, consider the following input:
Input:
```
3
3 5
4 7
9 4
```

Expected Output:
```
6
```

The program incorrectly calculates the result as 7 instead of 6 because it does not properly account for the cumulative effect of previous increments.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all cases correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes two lists `A` and `B` of length `N` (where `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`), with elements `A_i` ranging from `0` to `10^9` and `B_i` ranging from `1` to `10^9`. It calculates the minimum number of increments needed to ensure that for every pair `(a, b)` in the lists, `(a + cnt) % b == 0`, where `cnt` starts at `0`. The function iterates through the lists in reverse order, updating `cnt` when necessary. After the loop, the function prints the final value of `cnt`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
