Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program iterates through the sequences in reverse order, which is incorrect. The correct approach should be to iterate from the first element to the last, ensuring that each \( A_i \) becomes a multiple of \( B_i \) by incrementing the necessary elements.

Here is a counterexample:

For the input:
```
3
3 5
2 7
9 4
```

The expected output is 7. However, the current implementation will not correctly compute this.

To fix this, the program should be modified to iterate from the first element to the last, adjusting the count accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ab = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = ab[i]
        if (a + cnt) % b != 0:
            cnt += b - (a + cnt) % b
    print(cnt)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that each \( A_i \) is made a multiple of \( B_i \) by iterating from the start and adjusting the count as needed.
