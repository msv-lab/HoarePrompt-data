Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description**: The goal is to find the minimum number of times buttons need to be pressed so that each \(A_i\) becomes a multiple of \(B_i\).

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the integer \(N\), which represents the number of pairs \((A_i, B_i)\).
   - It then processes these pairs in reverse order using a for loop.
   - For each pair \((A_i, B_i)\), it checks if \((A_i + cnt) \mod B_i\) is zero. If it is, no additional button presses are needed for this pair.
   - If it is not zero, it calculates how many additional button presses are required to make \((A_i + cnt)\) a multiple of \(B_i\). This is done by computing \(B_i - (A_i + cnt) \mod B_i\), and adding this value to `cnt`.

3. **Reverse Order Processing**:
   - Processing in reverse order ensures that the effect of previous button presses (from earlier indices) does not interfere with the current calculations, allowing the algorithm to work correctly even if some \(A_i\) values become larger due to previous increments.

4. **Output**:
   - The final value of `cnt` is printed, which represents the minimum number of button presses needed to satisfy the conditions.

Since the program follows the exact logic specified in the problem description and handles all cases as required, it is correct.
