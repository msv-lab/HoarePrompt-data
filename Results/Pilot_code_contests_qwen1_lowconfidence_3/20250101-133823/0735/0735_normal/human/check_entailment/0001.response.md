Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly calculate the minimum number of button presses required to make each \(A_i\) a multiple of \(B_i\). The logic works as follows:

1. It iterates from the last index to the first, ensuring that each value \(A_i\) becomes a multiple of \(B_i\).
2. For each \(i\), it calculates how many additional increments (\(cnt\)) are needed to make \(A_i + cnt\) divisible by \(B_i\).
3. It updates \(cnt\) accordingly and continues to the next index.

Given the constraints and the problem description, this approach ensures that the minimum number of button presses is calculated efficiently. Since the program handles the logic correctly for the given problem description and the examples provided, it is correct.
