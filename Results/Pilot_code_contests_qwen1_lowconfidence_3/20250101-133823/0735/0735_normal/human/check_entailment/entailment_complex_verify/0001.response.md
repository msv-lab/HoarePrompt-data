Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of button presses required to make each \(A_i\) a multiple of \(B_i\). 

- The program correctly reads the number of terms \(N\) and initializes the list `ab` with pairs of integers from the input.
- It iterates over the list `ab` in reverse order, ensuring that for each pair \((A_i, B_i)\), it calculates the minimum number of increments needed to make \(A_i + cnt\) divisible by \(B_i\).
- The variable `cnt` is updated accordingly to achieve this condition.
- After the loop completes, the program prints the final value of `cnt`, which represents the minimum number of button presses required.

The annotations support the correctness of the program, and the logic implemented aligns with the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate.
