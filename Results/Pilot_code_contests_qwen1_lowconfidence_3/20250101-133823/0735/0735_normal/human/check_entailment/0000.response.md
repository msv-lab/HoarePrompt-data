Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of button presses required to make each \(A_i\) a multiple of \(B_i\). Specifically, the loop starts from the last element and works its way backwards, which can lead to incorrect results.

Consider the following example:
Input:
```
3
3 5
2 7
9 4
```

Expected Output:
```
7
```

However, the program's logic does not correctly handle this scenario. Let's manually go through the steps:

1. For \(i = 2\): \(A_2 = 2\), \(B_2 = 7\). To make \(A_2\) a multiple of \(B_2\), we need to increment \(A_2\) by 5 (since \(2 + 5 = 7\)). So, the increment for \(A_2\) is 5.
2. For \(i = 1\): \(A_1 = 3\), \(B_1 = 5\). After incrementing \(A_2\) by 5, the sequence becomes \([3, 7, 9]\). Now, to make \(A_1\) a multiple of \(B_1\), we need to increment \(A_1\) by 2 (since \(3 + 2 = 5\)). So, the increment for \(A_1\) is 2.

The total number of button presses required is \(5 + 2 = 7\), which matches the expected output.

However, the program's logic starts from the end and only considers the current value without accounting for future increments. This leads to incorrect results in some cases. For instance, consider the following input:
Input:
```
3
3 5
4 7
9 4
```

Expected Output:
```
6
```

The program incorrectly calculates the result as 7 instead of 6 because it does not properly account for the cumulative effect of previous increments.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all cases correctly.
