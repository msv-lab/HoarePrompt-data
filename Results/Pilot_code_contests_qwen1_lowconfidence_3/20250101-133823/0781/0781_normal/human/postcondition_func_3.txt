The function `func_4()` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input, splits it into individual strings, and returns a map object containing these strings. Each string represents a filling of the patty-cakes. The function assumes that the input follows the format specified (an integer \(T\) indicating the number of test cases, followed by \(T\) lines, each containing an integer \(n\) indicating the number of patty-cakes, and then \(n\) integers representing the fillings). However, the function does not handle the case where the input does not conform to this format. Specifically, it does not validate the number of test cases \(T\), nor does it validate that the subsequent lines contain the correct number of patty-cake fillings.
