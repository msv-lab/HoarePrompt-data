Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where one element is `n` and all others are 0, `a` is a list of indices sorted in descending order, `s` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `(n - 1) // (n + 1) + 1`, and the count of 1's in `f` is `n - s` if `s != 2`, otherwise no changes occur.***
