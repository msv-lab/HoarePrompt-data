Functionality: **The function processes multiple bags, each containing patty-cakes with various fillings. For each bag, it checks if there are at least two patty-cakes with the same filling. If this condition holds for all bags, the function calls `func_13(True)` and returns `True`. Otherwise, it calculates a value based on the frequency of fillings and calls `func_13()` with this value, returning `False`. The function iterates over all bags, and for each bag, it sorts the fillings in descending order, counts the frequency of each filling, and uses these counts to determine the result.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If all bags contain exactly two patty-cakes with the same filling, the function will return `True`.
- If no bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling, the function will return `False`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where a bag has fewer than two patty-cakes, although it implicitly assumes that such cases are not present due to the problem statement constraints.
- The function does not provide any output if `func_13()` does not return a boolean value. This could be a potential issue depending on the implementation of `func_13()`.
