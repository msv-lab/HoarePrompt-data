Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where one element is `n` and all others are 0, `a` is a list of indices sorted in descending order, `s` is an integer, `ans` is either `n - 2` if `s == 2`, or \((n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1\) otherwise. If `s == n`, then `ans` is passed to `func_13`.***

Explanation:
- The if condition checks if the count of 1's in the list `f` is equal to `n - s`.
- If the condition is true, then `ans` is updated based on whether `s` equals 2 or not, and `ans` is passed to `func_13`.
- If the condition is false, no changes occur since there is no else part. Therefore, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition, with the additional condition that if `s == n`, `ans` is passed to `func_13`.
