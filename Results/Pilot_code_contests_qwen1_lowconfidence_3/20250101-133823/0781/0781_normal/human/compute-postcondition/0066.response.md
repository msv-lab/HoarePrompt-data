The code initializes the list `f` with 100,005 zeros. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, `s`, or `ans`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where each element is 0, `a` is now sorted in descending order, `s` is the updated maximum value in `f`, `ans` is equal to `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, and `func_13(ans)` will be called again.**
