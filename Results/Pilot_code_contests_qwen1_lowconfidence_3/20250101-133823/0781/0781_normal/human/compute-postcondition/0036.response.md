To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and analyze the conditions required for the loop to run.

### Given States:
- `i` is 0
- `f` is a list of 100,005 zeros
- `n` is the return value of `func_1()`
- `a` is a list sorted in descending order and holds the return value of `func_6()`
- `s` is the maximum value in `f` which is `f[a[0]] + n`
- `ans` is `(n - 1) // ((f[a[0]] + n) + 1) + 1`
- `func_13(ans)` has been called with `ans` as an argument

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0.
2. **Variable `n`**: This is the condition for the loop to continue. The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
3. **Other Variables (`f`, `a`, `s`, `ans`)**: These variables are not directly related to the loop condition but may affect other parts of the program logic. They are not necessary to adjust for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- For the loop to execute, the condition `i < n` must hold true.
- Since `i` is initially 0, the loop will execute as long as `n > 0`.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `n` is greater than 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
