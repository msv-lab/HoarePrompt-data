Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where each element at index `a[i]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range of `n`, `a` is a list sorted in descending order and holds the return value of `func_6()`, `s` is the maximum value in `f`, `ans` is `(n - 1) // ((f[a[0]] + n) + 1) + 1`, `func_13(ans)` has been called with `ans` as an argument, and the value of `s` is equal to `n`.**
