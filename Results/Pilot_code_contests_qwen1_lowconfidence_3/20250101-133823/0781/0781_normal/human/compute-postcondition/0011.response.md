Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `args` is a list with at least `T + 2` elements, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`. Since the condition `not at_start` does not change any of these variables and is always true under the given precondition, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
