Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where each element at index `a[i]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range of `n`, `a` is a list sorted in descending order and holds the return value of `func_6()`, and `func_13(0)` has been called. If `s` is 2, `ans` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1` and `s` is not equal to 2. The count of 1's in the list `f` changes according to the value of `s`.***
