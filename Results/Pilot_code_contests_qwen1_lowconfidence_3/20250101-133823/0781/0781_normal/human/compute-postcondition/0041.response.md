The code `f[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `f[a[i]]` by 1. Given the initial state where `n` is greater than 1 and `f[a[n-1]]` is incremented by 1, we need to determine the impact on the variables.

From the initial state, we know:
- `n > 1`
- `f[a[n-1]]` is incremented by 1, which means `f[a[n-1]]` has been set to some value plus 1.

Now, the code `f[a[i]] += 1` will increment `f[a[i]]` by 1. Since `i` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[i]` without additional context, but we know it will increment the value of `f[a[i]]` by 1. 

Given this, the updated states are:
- `n > 1` remains unchanged.
- `f[a[n-1]]` was already incremented by 1, and now `f[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is an index in the range of `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `f[a[n-1]]` is incremented by 1 and `f[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**
