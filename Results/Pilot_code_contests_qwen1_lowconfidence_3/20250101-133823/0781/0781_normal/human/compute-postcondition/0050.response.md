Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where each element at index `a[i]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range of `n`, `a` is a list sorted in descending order and holds the return value of `func_6()`, `s` is the maximum value in `f`, `ans` is 0, and `func_13(0)` has been called. The count of 1's in the list `f` is equal to `n - s`. The current value of `s` is 2.***
