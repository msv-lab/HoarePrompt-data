`n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1()`. The value of `f`, `a`, `s`, and `ans` remains unchanged from their previous states. The function call `func_13(ans)` will be made with the current value of `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where each element at index `a[i]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range of the previous `n`, `a` is a list sorted in descending order and holds the return value of `func_6()`, `s` is the updated maximum value in `f`, `ans` is equal to `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, and `func_13(ans)` will be called again.**
