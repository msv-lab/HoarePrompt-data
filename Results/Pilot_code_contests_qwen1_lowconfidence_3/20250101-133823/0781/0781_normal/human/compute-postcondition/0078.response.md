The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there was no loop or iteration context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where one element is `n` and all others are 0, `a` is a list of indices sorted in descending order, `s` is `n`, `ans` is equal to `(n - 1) // (n + 1) + 1`, the condition `s == n` is true, and the function `func_13(0)` has been called.**
