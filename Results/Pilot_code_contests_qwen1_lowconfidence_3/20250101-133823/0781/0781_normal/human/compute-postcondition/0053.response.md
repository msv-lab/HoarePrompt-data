`ans` is assigned the value of `(n - 1) // (s + 1)`. Given that `s` is the maximum value in `f`, and the initial state does not provide the exact value of `s`, we keep it as `s`. The initial values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where each element at index `a[i]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range of `n`, `a` is a list sorted in descending order and holds the return value of `func_6()`, `s` is the maximum value in `f`, `ans` is equal to `(n - 1) // (s + 1)`, and `s` is not equal to 2.**
