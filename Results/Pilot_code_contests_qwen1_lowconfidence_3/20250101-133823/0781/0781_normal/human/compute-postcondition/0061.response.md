`func_13(ans)` is called, which means that `ans` is passed as an argument to `func_13`. However, the code does not modify any of the variables directly. It only calls a function with `ans` as an argument. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where each element at index `a[i]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range of `n`, `a` is a list sorted in descending order and holds the return value of `func_6()`, `s` is the maximum value in `f`, `ans` is equal to `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, and the count of 1's in the list `f` changes according to the value of `s`, and `func_13(ans)` has been called.**
