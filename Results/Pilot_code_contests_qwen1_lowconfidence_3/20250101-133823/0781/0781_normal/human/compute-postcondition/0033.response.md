The code `a = func_6()` assigns the return value of `func_6()` to the variable `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged because `func_6()` does not directly modify any of the existing variables. 

Therefore, the output state is:
- `i` is 0
- `f` has been updated by incrementing each `f[a[i]]` (for `i` in range `n`) by 1
- `n` is the return value of `func_1()`
- `a` is a list that is sorted in descending order
- `s` is the maximum value in `f` which is `f[a[0]] + n`
- `ans` is `(n - 1) // ((f[a[0]] + n) + 1) + 1`
- `func_13(ans)` has been called with `ans` as an argument
- `a` is now assigned the return value of `func_6()`

Output State: **`i` is 0, `f` has been updated by incrementing each `f[a[i]]` (for `i` in range `n`) by 1, `n` is the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is a list that is sorted in descending order and now holds the return value of `func_6()`, `s` is the maximum value in `f` which is `f[a[0]] + n`, `ans` is `(n - 1) // ((f[a[0]] + n) + 1) + 1`, `func_13(ans)` has been called with `ans` as an argument.**
