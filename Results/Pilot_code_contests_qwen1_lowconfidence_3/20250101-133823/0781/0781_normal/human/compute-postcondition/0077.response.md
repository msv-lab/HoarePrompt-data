The function `func_13(0)` is called with an argument of 0. However, since no specific implementation of `func_13` is provided, we cannot determine what changes this function might make to the variables. Given the initial state and without knowing the exact behavior of `func_13`, we can only say that the function call may modify the state of the variables within `func_13`.

The variables `n`, `f`, `a`, `s`, and `ans` are listed in the initial state, and their values are not altered directly by the given function call. The condition `s == n` remains true.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where one element is `n` and all others are 0, `a` is a list of indices sorted in descending order, `s` is `n`, `ans` is equal to `(n - 1) // (n + 1) + 1`, the condition `s == n` is true, and the function `func_13(0)` has been called.**
