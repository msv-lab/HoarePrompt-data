`at_start` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `T`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `sep`, and `file` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer representing the number of bags, for each bag `n` is a positive integer representing the number of patty-cakes in the bag, and a list of `n` positive integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` represents the filling of the i-th patty-cake. `sep` is set to ' ', `file` is set to `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `True`.**
