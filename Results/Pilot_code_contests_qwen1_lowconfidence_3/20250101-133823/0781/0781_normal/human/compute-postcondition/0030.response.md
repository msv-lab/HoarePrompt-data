The function `func_13(ans)` is called with `ans` as an argument, but the function itself does not modify any variables from the initial state. Therefore, the only thing that changes is the fact that `func_13(ans)` has been called, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `f` has been updated by incrementing each `f[a[i]]` (for `i` in range `n`) by 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list that is sorted in descending order, `s` is the maximum value in `f` which is `f[a[0]] + n`, `ans` is `(n - 1) // ((f[a[0]] + n) + 1) + 1`, `func_13(ans)` has been called with `ans` as an argument.**
