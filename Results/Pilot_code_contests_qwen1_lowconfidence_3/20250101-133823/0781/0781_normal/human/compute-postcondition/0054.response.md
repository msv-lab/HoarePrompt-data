The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where each element at index `a[i]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range of `n`, `a` is a list sorted in descending order and holds the return value of `func_6()`, `s` is the maximum value in `f`, `ans` is equal to `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, and `s` is not equal to 2.**
