The function `func_12` accepts no parameters directly. However, based on the constraints, it seems the function might be designed to process data that is not provided as function arguments but rather as input within the function. The functionality described involves processing multiple bags, each containing patty-cakes with various fillings, and determining if each bag meets a specific condition (at least two patty-cakes with the same filling).

Given the constraints and the typical structure of such problems, the function likely takes the number of bags (`T`), the number of patty-cakes in each bag (`n`), and the list of fillings for each patty-cake (`a`) as inputs, though these are not explicitly passed as parameters to the function.

Output: Case_1: The function processes the bags and checks if each bag has at least two patty-cakes with the same filling. If all bags meet this condition, the function returns `True`. 
Case_2: If any bag does not have at least two patty-cakes with the same filling, the function returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_12` is to process multiple bags, each containing patty-cakes with various fillings, and return `True` if every bag has at least two patty-cakes with the same filling, and `False` otherwise.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple bags, each containing patty-cakes with various fillings, and returns `True` if every bag has at least two patty-cakes with the same filling, and `False` otherwise.**
