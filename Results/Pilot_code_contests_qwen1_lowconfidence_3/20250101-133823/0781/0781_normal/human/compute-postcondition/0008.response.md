The code `at_start = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `at_start`. The values of other variables such as `T`, `args`, `sep`, and `file` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer, `args` is a list with at least `T + 1` elements, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `args` is a list with at least `T + 1` elements, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`**
