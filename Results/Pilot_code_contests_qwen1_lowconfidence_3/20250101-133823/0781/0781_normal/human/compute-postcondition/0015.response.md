The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to `file`. The value of `sep` is ' ', which means a space character will be written to `file`. However, the actual content of `file` (in this case, `sys.stdout`) is not explicitly shown in the output state. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `args` is a list with at least `T + 1` elements, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`**
