According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `args`. The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `args`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:
- `T` is a positive integer.
- `args` is a list with at least `T + 2` elements.
- `sep` is ' '.
- `file` is `sys.stdout`.
- `at_start` is `False`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `args` must still have elements remaining. Since the list initially had at least `T + 2` elements and one element has been processed in the previous iteration, the list now has at least `T + 1` elements remaining.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `args` has at least `T + 1` elements remaining.

State: **`T` is a positive integer, `args` is a list with at least `T + 1` elements, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`**
