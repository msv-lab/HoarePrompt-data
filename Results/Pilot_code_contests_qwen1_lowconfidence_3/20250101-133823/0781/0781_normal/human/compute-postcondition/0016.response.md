Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `args` is a list with at least `T + 1` elements, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`. Since the condition `not at_start` is false, the if part does not execute any further operations, so the state of the program remains unchanged.***
