The code `continue` is used within a loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next one. However, since no loop context is provided in the initial state or the code snippet, we assume this `continue` statement is within an implicit loop structure that was established by the call to `func_13(0)`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where each element at index `a[i]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range of `n`.
- `a` is a list sorted in descending order and holds the return value of `func_6()`.
- `s` is the maximum value in `f`.
- `ans` is `0`.
- `func_13(0)` has been called.

Since the `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables outside the loop and only serves to continue to the next iteration of the loop, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where each element at index `a[i]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range of `n`, `a` is a list sorted in descending order and holds the return value of `func_6()`, `s` is the maximum value in `f`, `ans` is `0`, and `func_13(0)` has been called.**
