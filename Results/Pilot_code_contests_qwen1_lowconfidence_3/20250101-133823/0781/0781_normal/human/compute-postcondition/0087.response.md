The function `func_13(ans)` is called, but the function itself is not defined in the provided code snippet. This means that the value of `ans` will be passed to `func_13`, but the actual operation within `func_13` is not specified. Since no operation is performed on the variables within the given code snippet, the only change is that `ans` is passed to `func_13`.

The values of the other variables (`n`, `f`, `a`, `s`) remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is determined based on the conditions provided in the initial state.

Let's summarize the state:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where one element is `n` and all others are 0.
- `a` is a list of indices sorted in descending order.
- `s` is an integer.
- The count of 1's in `f` is `n - s`.
- If `s == 2`, then `ans` is equal to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to \((n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1\).

Since `ans` is passed to `func_13`, its value is determined by the formula based on the value of `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where one element is `n` and all others are 0, `a` is a list of indices sorted in descending order, `s` is an integer, the count of 1's in `f` is `n - s`, and `ans` is either `n - 2` if `s == 2`, or \((n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1\) otherwise. `ans` is passed to `func_13`.**
