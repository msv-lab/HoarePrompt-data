The code `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` removes values from the `kwargs` dictionary and assigns them to the variables `sep` and `file`. However, since the initial state only mentions the variables `T`, `n`, and the list of fillings `a_i`, and these variables are not directly affected by this code, their values remain unchanged. The code also does not return any value, so there are no additional values to include.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer representing the number of bags, for each bag `n` is a positive integer representing the number of patty-cakes in the bag, and a list of `n` positive integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` represents the filling of the i-th patty-cake. `sep` is set to ' ' and `file` is set to `sys.stdout`.**
