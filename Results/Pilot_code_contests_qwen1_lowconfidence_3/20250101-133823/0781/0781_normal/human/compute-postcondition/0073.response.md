Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where one element (at index `a[i]` for all `i` in `range(n)`) is incremented by `n` and all other elements remain 0, `a` is a list of indices sorted in descending order, `s` is the maximum value in `f`, `ans` is equal to `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, and `func_13(ans)` will be called again.**
