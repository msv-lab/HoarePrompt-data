According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Here are the current states:

- `n` is the value returned by `func_1()`
- `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where each element is 0
- `a` is now sorted in descending order
- `s` is the updated maximum value in `f`
- `ans` is equal to `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`
- `func_13(ans)` will be called again

The only state that directly affects the loop's execution is `n`. Since the loop requires `n` to be greater than 0, we need to adjust `n` to ensure this condition is met.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where each element is 0, `a` is now sorted in descending order, `s` is the updated maximum value in `f`, `ans` is equal to `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, and `func_13(ans)` will be called again**
