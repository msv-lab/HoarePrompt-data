The code `n = func_1()` assigns the return value of `func_1()` to `n`. However, since `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code snippet, its return value cannot be determined. Therefore, we only know that `n` now holds whatever value `func_1()` returns.

The other variables (`i`, `f`, `a`, `s`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states because the code does not modify them directly.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `f` has been updated by incrementing each `f[a[i]]` (for `i` in range `n`) by 1, `n` is the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is a list that is sorted in descending order, `s` is the maximum value in `f` which is `f[a[0]] + n`, `ans` is `(n - 1) // ((f[a[0]] + n) + 1) + 1`, `func_13(ans)` has been called with `ans` as an argument.**
