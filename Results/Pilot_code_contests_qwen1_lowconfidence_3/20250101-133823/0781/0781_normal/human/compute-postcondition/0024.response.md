The function `func_13` accepts a parameter `T`. `T` is a positive integer representing the number of bags. Each bag has a positive integer `n` representing the number of patty-cakes in the bag, and a list of `n` positive integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` represents the filling of the i-th patty-cake. It is guaranteed that `2 <= n <= 10^5`, each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling, and the sum of `n` over all bags does not exceed `10^5`.

The function returns whether there is at least one bag containing at least two patty-cakes with the same filling.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_13` is to accept a parameter `T`, and check if any of the bags contain at least two patty-cakes with the same filling, returning `True` if so, and `False` otherwise.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `T`, and returns `True` if any of the bags contain at least two patty-cakes with the same filling, otherwise it returns `False`.**
