The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is ' ') into `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). This operation does not change the values of `T`, `args`, `sep`, `file`, or `at_start`. Therefore, the only change is that `sys.stdout` will have a space written to it.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `args` is a list with at least `T + 2` elements, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`**
