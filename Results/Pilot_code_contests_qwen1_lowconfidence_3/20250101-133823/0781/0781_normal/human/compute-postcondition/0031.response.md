Let's break down the given information and determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `f` has been updated by incrementing each `f[a[i]]` (for `i` in range `n`) by 1
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `a` is a list that is sorted in descending order
   - `s` is the maximum value in `f` which is `f[a[0]] + n`
   - `ans` is `(n - 1) // ((f[a[0]] + n) + 1) + 1`
   - `func_13(ans)` has been called with `ans` as an argument

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(func_1()):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

### Analysis:

1. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `func_1()` times.
   - `func_1()` is a function that returns an integer, representing the number of iterations for the loop.

2. **Adjusting States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`.
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and goes up to `n-1`, if `i` is `n-1`, it means we have completed one full pass through the range `range(n)`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will start from `0` again, and the loop will continue as long as `func_1()` still returns a non-zero value.

3. **Updating States for Next Iteration:**
   - `i` needs to be reset to `0`.
   - `f` remains unchanged since the increment operation happens within the loop body, but it doesn't affect the initial state for the next iteration.
   - `n`, `a`, `s`, `ans`, and the result of `func_13(ans)` remain unchanged.

### Conclusion:

The state needs to be adjusted such that the loop can execute one more time. This means resetting `i` to `0`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`i` is 0, `f` has been updated by incrementing each `f[a[i]]` (for `i` in range `n`) by 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list that is sorted in descending order, `s` is the maximum value in `f` which is `f[a[0]] + n`, `ans` is `(n - 1) // ((f[a[0]] + n) + 1) + 1`, `func_13(ans)` has been called with `ans` as an argument.**
