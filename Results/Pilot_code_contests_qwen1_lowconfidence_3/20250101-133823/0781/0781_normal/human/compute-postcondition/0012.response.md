`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file object `file`. However, the value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, and neither is the value of `file` (which is `sys.stdout`), so the exact output cannot be determined. But we know that `file` has written `str(x)` to itself.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `args` is a list with at least `T + 2` elements, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `sys.stdout` has written `str(x)` to it.**
