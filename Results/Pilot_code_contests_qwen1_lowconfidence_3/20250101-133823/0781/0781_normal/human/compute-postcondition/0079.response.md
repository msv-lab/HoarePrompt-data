Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where one element is `n` and all others are 0, `a` is a list of indices sorted in descending order, `s` is `n`, `ans` is equal to `(n - 1) // (n + 1) + 1`. If the condition `s == n` is true, then `func_13(0)` has been called. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
