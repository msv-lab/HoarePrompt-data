The function `func_13(ans)` is called with the argument `ans`. However, the function `func_13` itself is not defined in the provided code snippet. Since no further operations are performed within the snippet and no return value from `func_13` is captured, the values of the variables `n`, `f`, `a`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where one element is `n` and all others are 0, `a` is a list of indices sorted in descending order, `s` is an integer, `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`**
