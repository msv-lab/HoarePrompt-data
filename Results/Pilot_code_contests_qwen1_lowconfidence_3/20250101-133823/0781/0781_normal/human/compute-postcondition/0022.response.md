`file.flush()` is called, which flushes the write buffer of the file. This operation does not change the value of `kwargs` but ensures that the contents are written to the file immediately. The value of `kwargs` remains unchanged because the code only interacts with the file and does not modify `kwargs`.

Output State: **`kwargs` does not contain 'end' key, or the value of 'end' is '\n' after pop operation, file contains the written string, and the current value of `kwargs` does not include 'flush' key or the value of 'flush' is `False`, and the file write buffer is flushed.**
