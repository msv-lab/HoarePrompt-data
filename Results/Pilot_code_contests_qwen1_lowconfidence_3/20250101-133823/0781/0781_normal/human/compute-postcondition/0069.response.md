According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where each element is 0 (except for one element which is now incremented by 1)
- `a` is now sorted in descending order
- `s` is the new maximum value in `f`
- `ans` is equal to `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`
- `func_13(ans)` will be called again

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be decremented by 1 (since `i` will increment from 0 to 1, reducing `n` by 1). Therefore, `n` must now be greater than 1.

The state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where each element is 0 (except for one element which is now incremented by 1), `a` is now sorted in descending order, `s` is the new maximum value in `f`, `ans` is equal to `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, and `func_13(ans)` will be called again**
