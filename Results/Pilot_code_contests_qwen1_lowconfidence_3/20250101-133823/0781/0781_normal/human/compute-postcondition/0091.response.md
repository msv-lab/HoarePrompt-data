`ans` is incremented by 1. The value of `ans` was previously `(n - 1) // (s + 1)`, so now `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where one element is `n` and all others are 0, `a` is a list of indices sorted in descending order, `s` is an integer, `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`**
