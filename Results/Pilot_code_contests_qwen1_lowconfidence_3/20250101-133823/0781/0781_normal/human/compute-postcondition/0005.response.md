The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is ' ') into `file`. Since `file` is set to `sys.stdout`, this will print a space character. However, no new value is assigned to any variable, and the states of `T`, `args`, `sep`, `file`, and `at_start` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `args` is a list with at least `T + 1` elements, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`**
