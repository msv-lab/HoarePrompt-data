Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where one element is `n` and all others are 0, `a` is a list of indices sorted in descending order, `s` is an integer, and the count of 1's in `f` is `n - s`. If `s == 2`, then `ans` is equal to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to \((n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1\).**
