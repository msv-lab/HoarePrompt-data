Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `f` has been updated by incrementing each `f[a[i]]` (for `i` in range `n`) by 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list that is sorted in descending order, `s` is the maximum value in `f` which is `f[a[0]] + n`. If `f.count(1) == n - s`, then `ans` is either `n - 2` if `s` equals 2, or `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1` if `s` is not equal to 2. In both cases, `func_13(ans)` has been called with `ans` as an argument.***
