The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a list of 100,005 integers where one element is `n` and all others are 0, `a` is a list of indices sorted in descending order, `s` is an integer, the count of 1's in `f` is `n - s`, and `ans` is either `n - 2` if `s == 2`, or \((n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1\) otherwise. `ans` is passed to `func_13`.**
