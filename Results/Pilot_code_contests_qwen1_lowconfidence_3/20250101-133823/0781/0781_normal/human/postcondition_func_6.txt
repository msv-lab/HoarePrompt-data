The function `func_7()` reads input from a file named 'input.txt' and writes output to a file named 'output.txt'. It does not directly process the parameters `T`, `n`, and `a` as described in the annotations; instead, it changes the standard input and output streams. After executing, the program's standard input is redirected to 'input.txt' and standard output is redirected to 'output.txt'. There are no operations performed on the input parameters `T`, `n`, and `a`, and no output is generated based on these parameters. The function does not return any value, and the final state of the program includes the standard input and output streams being redirected to files.
