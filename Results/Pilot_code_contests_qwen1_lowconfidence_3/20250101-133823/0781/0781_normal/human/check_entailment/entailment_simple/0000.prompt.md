You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Pinkie Pie has bought a bag of patty-cakes with different fillings! But it appeared that not all patty-cakes differ from one another with filling. In other words, the bag contains some patty-cakes with the same filling.

Pinkie Pie eats the patty-cakes one-by-one. She likes having fun so she decided not to simply eat the patty-cakes but to try not to eat the patty-cakes with the same filling way too often. To achieve this she wants the minimum distance between the eaten with the same filling to be the largest possible. Herein Pinkie Pie called the distance between two patty-cakes the number of eaten patty-cakes strictly between them.

Pinkie Pie can eat the patty-cakes in any order. She is impatient about eating all the patty-cakes up so she asks you to help her to count the greatest minimum distance between the eaten patty-cakes with the same filling amongst all possible orders of eating!

Pinkie Pie is going to buy more bags of patty-cakes so she asks you to solve this problem for several bags!

Input

The first line contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100): the number of bags for which you need to solve the problem.

The first line of each bag description contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5): the number of patty-cakes in it. The second line of the bag description contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n): the information of patty-cakes' fillings: same fillings are defined as same integers, different fillings are defined as different integers. It is guaranteed that each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all bags does not exceed 10^5.

Output

For each bag print in separate line one single integer: the largest minimum distance between the eaten patty-cakes with the same filling amongst all possible orders of eating for that bag.

Example

Input


4
7
1 7 1 6 4 4 6
8
1 1 4 6 4 6 4 7
3
3 3 3
6
2 5 2 3 1 4


Output


3
2
0
4

Note

For the first bag Pinkie Pie can eat the patty-cakes in the following order (by fillings): 1, 6, 4, 7, 1, 6, 4 (in this way, the minimum distance is equal to 3).

For the second bag Pinkie Pie can eat the patty-cakes in the following order (by fillings): 1, 4, 6, 7, 4, 1, 6, 4 (in this way, the minimum distance is equal to 2).

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
