Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. Specifically, the function `func_12` is intended to calculate the maximum minimum distance between eaten patty-cakes with the same filling, but it does not correctly implement this logic.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Distance:**
   - The function `func_12` attempts to calculate the maximum minimum distance by sorting the patty-cakes and counting occurrences of each filling. However, the logic used to determine the maximum minimum distance is flawed.
   - The current implementation assumes a simple division and addition without considering the optimal arrangement of patty-cakes.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The function does not handle cases where the distribution of patty-cakes is such that no optimal solution can be achieved by simple sorting and counting.
   - For example, consider the input `n = 7` and `a = [1, 7, 1, 6, 4, 4, 6]`. The current implementation might not correctly identify the optimal order to maximize the minimum distance.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
4
7
1 7 1 6 4 4 6
```
- The correct answer should be `3`, as the optimal order could be `1, 6, 4, 7, 1, 6, 4`.
- However, the provided program may fail to produce this result due to its flawed logic.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
