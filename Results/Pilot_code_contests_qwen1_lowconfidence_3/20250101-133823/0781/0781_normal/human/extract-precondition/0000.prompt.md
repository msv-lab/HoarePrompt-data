You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Pinkie Pie has bought a bag of patty-cakes with different fillings! But it appeared that not all patty-cakes differ from one another with filling. In other words, the bag contains some patty-cakes with the same filling.

Pinkie Pie eats the patty-cakes one-by-one. She likes having fun so she decided not to simply eat the patty-cakes but to try not to eat the patty-cakes with the same filling way too often. To achieve this she wants the minimum distance between the eaten with the same filling to be the largest possible. Herein Pinkie Pie called the distance between two patty-cakes the number of eaten patty-cakes strictly between them.

Pinkie Pie can eat the patty-cakes in any order. She is impatient about eating all the patty-cakes up so she asks you to help her to count the greatest minimum distance between the eaten patty-cakes with the same filling amongst all possible orders of eating!

Pinkie Pie is going to buy more bags of patty-cakes so she asks you to solve this problem for several bags!

Input

The first line contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100): the number of bags for which you need to solve the problem.

The first line of each bag description contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5): the number of patty-cakes in it. The second line of the bag description contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n): the information of patty-cakes' fillings: same fillings are defined as same integers, different fillings are defined as different integers. It is guaranteed that each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all bags does not exceed 10^5.

Output

For each bag print in separate line one single integer: the largest minimum distance between the eaten patty-cakes with the same filling amongst all possible orders of eating for that bag.

Example

Output

4

Note

For the first bag Pinkie Pie can eat the patty-cakes in the following order (by fillings): 1, 6, 4, 7, 1, 6, 4 (in this way, the minimum distance is equal to 3).

For the second bag Pinkie Pie can eat the patty-cakes in the following order (by fillings): 1, 4, 6, 7, 4, 1, 6, 4 (in this way, the minimum distance is equal to 2).
Program:
```
def func_13(*args, **kwargs):

    at_start = True
    for x in args:

        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
