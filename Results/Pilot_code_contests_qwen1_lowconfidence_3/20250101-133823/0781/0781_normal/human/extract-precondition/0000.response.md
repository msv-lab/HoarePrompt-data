Precondition: **T is a positive integer representing the number of bags. For each bag, n is a positive integer representing the number of patty-cakes in the bag, and a list of n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i represents the filling of the i-th patty-cake. It is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5, each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling, and the sum of n over all bags does not exceed 10^5.**
