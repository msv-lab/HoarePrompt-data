The function `func_5()` reads a single line of space-separated integers from the user input and returns a map object containing these integers. There are no parameters accepted by the function, and the return type is a map object. The function does not modify any external variables; it only processes the input provided by the user. Potential edge cases include the input being empty (though this would raise a `ValueError` when calling `map(int, input().split())`) or the input containing non-integer values (which would also raise a `ValueError`).
