- If `func_5()` is not defined or if its implementation is incomplete, the function `func_6()` would raise a `NameError` upon execution.
- The annotation mentions that each bag has at least two patty-cakes with the same filling, but it does not specify how `func_5()` handles the case where multiple bags share the same filling. It is possible that `func_6()` might return a flattened list of all duplicate fillings, or it could handle duplicates differently depending on the implementation of `func_5()`.
- The code does not mention handling the case where a filling appears in more than one bag, but if `func_5()` is expected to find all unique duplicate fillings across all bags, then it should be able to handle this scenario.
