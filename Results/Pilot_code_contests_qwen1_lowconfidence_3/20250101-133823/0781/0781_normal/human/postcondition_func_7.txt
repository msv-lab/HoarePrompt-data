The function `func_8` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both positive integers with `x >= y`. It calculates their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop terminates, `x` contains the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is set to 0. The function returns `x` (the GCD) and `y` (which is 0). The function correctly handles the case when `y` becomes 0, which is the termination condition of the loop. There are no apparent missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code.
