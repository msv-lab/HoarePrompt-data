The function processes multiple bags, each containing patty-cakes with various fillings. For each bag, it checks if there are at least two patty-cakes with the same filling. If this condition holds for all bags, the function calls `func_13(True)` and returns `True`. Otherwise, it calculates a value based on the frequency of fillings and calls `func_13()` with this value, returning `False`. The function iterates over all bags, and for each bag, it sorts the fillings in descending order, counts the frequency of each filling, and uses these counts to determine the result.
