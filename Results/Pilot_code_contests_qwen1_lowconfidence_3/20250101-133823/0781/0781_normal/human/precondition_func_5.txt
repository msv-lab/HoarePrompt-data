T is a positive integer such that 1 <= T <= 100. Each bag description starts with an integer n representing the number of patty-cakes (2 <= n <= 10^5), followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n representing the fillings of the patty-cakes (1 <= a_i <= n). It is guaranteed that each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling and the sum of n over all bags does not exceed 10^5.
