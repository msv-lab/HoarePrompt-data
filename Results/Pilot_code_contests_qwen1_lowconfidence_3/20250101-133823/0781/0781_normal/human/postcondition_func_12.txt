The function `func_13()` does not actually check for any condition related to patty-cakes or bags. Instead, it simply prints the elements provided in the `args` parameter, separated by a specified separator (`sep`) and ending with a specified end character (`end`). If the `flush` parameter is set to `True`, it also flushes the output buffer. The function does not return any value and thus cannot fulfill the stated return postconditions. There are no parameters accepted by the function other than the variadic arguments (`args`), `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush`. After the function concludes, the `file` object (defaulting to `sys.stdout`) will contain the printed elements, possibly flushed based on the `flush` parameter.
