T is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 100. For each bag, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n represents the fillings of the patty-cakes. It is guaranteed that each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling, and the sum of n over all bags does not exceed 10^5.
