You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Monocarp and Polycarp are learning new programming techniques. Now they decided to try pair programming.

It's known that they have worked together on the same file for n + m minutes. Every minute exactly one of them made one change to the file. Before they started, there were already k lines written in the file.

Every minute exactly one of them does one of two actions: adds a new line to the end of the file or changes one of its lines.

Monocarp worked in total for n minutes and performed the sequence of actions [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]. If a_i = 0, then he adds a new line to the end of the file. If a_i > 0, then he changes the line with the number a_i. Monocarp performed actions strictly in this order: a_1, then a_2, ..., a_n.

Polycarp worked in total for m minutes and performed the sequence of actions [b_1, b_2, ..., b_m]. If b_j = 0, then he adds a new line to the end of the file. If b_j > 0, then he changes the line with the number b_j. Polycarp performed actions strictly in this order: b_1, then b_2, ..., b_m.

Restore their common sequence of actions of length n + m such that all actions would be correct — there should be no changes to lines that do not yet exist. Keep in mind that in the common sequence Monocarp's actions should form the subsequence [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n] and Polycarp's — subsequence [b_1, b_2, ..., b_m]. They can replace each other at the computer any number of times.

Let's look at an example. Suppose k = 3. Monocarp first changed the line with the number 2 and then added a new line (thus, n = 2, \: a = [2, 0]). Polycarp first added a new line and then changed the line with the number 5 (thus, m = 2, \: b = [0, 5]).

Since the initial length of the file was 3, in order for Polycarp to change line number 5 two new lines must be added beforehand. Examples of correct sequences of changes, in this case, would be [0, 2, 0, 5] and [2, 0, 0, 5]. Changes [0, 0, 5, 2] (wrong order of actions) and [0, 5, 2, 0] (line 5 cannot be edited yet) are not correct.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). Then t test cases follow. Before each test case, there is an empty line.

Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains three integers k, n, m (0 ≤ k ≤ 100, 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the initial number of lines in file and lengths of Monocarp's and Polycarp's sequences of changes respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 300).

The third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (0 ≤ b_j ≤ 300).

Output

For each test case print any correct common sequence of Monocarp's and Polycarp's actions of length n + m or -1 if such sequence doesn't exist.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
