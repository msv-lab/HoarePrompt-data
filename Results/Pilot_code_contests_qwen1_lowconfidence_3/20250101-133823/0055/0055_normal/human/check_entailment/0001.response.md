Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to generate a correct common sequence of actions for Monocarp and Polycarp. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are empty, which means they do not contain any implementation for solving the problem. 

To illustrate, let's consider a simple test case:
- Initial lines: `k = 3`
- Monocarp's actions: `n = 2`, `[2, 0]`
- Polycarp's actions: `m = 2`, `[0, 5]`

The expected output is a sequence like `2 0 0 5` or `0 2 0 5`, but the current program does not generate any sequence. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
