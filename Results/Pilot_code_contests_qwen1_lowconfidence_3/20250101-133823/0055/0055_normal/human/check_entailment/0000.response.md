Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality to generate a correct common sequence of actions for Monocarp and Polycarp. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` defined in the program are not relevant to solving the problem. The main issue is that the program does not handle the logic needed to ensure that changes to lines only occur after those lines have been added to the file.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3 2 2
2 0
0 5
```

Expected output:
```
2 0 0 5
```

However, the provided program will not generate the correct sequence because it does not have the necessary logic to enforce the constraints of the problem. Specifically, it does not check whether a line exists before performing a change operation.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
