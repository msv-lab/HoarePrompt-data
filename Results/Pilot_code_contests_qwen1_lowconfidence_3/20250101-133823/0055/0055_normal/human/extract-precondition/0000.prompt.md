You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Monocarp and Polycarp are learning new programming techniques. Now they decided to try pair programming.

It's known that they have worked together on the same file for n + m minutes. Every minute exactly one of them made one change to the file. Before they started, there were already k lines written in the file.

Every minute exactly one of them does one of two actions: adds a new line to the end of the file or changes one of its lines.

Monocarp worked in total for n minutes and performed the sequence of actions [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]. If a_i = 0, then he adds a new line to the end of the file. If a_i > 0, then he changes the line with the number a_i. Monocarp performed actions strictly in this order: a_1, then a_2, ..., a_n.

Polycarp worked in total for m minutes and performed the sequence of actions [b_1, b_2, ..., b_m]. If b_j = 0, then he adds a new line to the end of the file. If b_j > 0, then he changes the line with the number b_j. Polycarp performed actions strictly in this order: b_1, then b_2, ..., b_m.

Restore their common sequence of actions of length n + m such that all actions would be correct — there should be no changes to lines that do not yet exist. Keep in mind that in the common sequence Monocarp's actions should form the subsequence [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n] and Polycarp's — subsequence [b_1, b_2, ..., b_m]. They can replace each other at the computer any number of times.

Let's look at an example. Suppose k = 3. Monocarp first changed the line with the number 2 and then added a new line (thus, n = 2, \: a = [2, 0]). Polycarp first added a new line and then changed the line with the number 5 (thus, m = 2, \: b = [0, 5]).

Since the initial length of the file was 3, in order for Polycarp to change line number 5 two new lines must be added beforehand. Examples of correct sequences of changes, in this case, would be [0, 2, 0, 5] and [2, 0, 0, 5]. Changes [0, 0, 5, 2] (wrong order of actions) and [0, 5, 2, 0] (line 5 cannot be edited yet) are not correct.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). Then t test cases follow. Before each test case, there is an empty line.

Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains three integers k, n, m (0 ≤ k ≤ 100, 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the initial number of lines in file and lengths of Monocarp's and Polycarp's sequences of changes respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 300).

The third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (0 ≤ b_j ≤ 300).

Output

For each test case print any correct common sequence of Monocarp's and Polycarp's actions of length n + m or -1 if such sequence doesn't exist.
