According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop continues as long as `args` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is `False`, `k` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, and `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least one element.

For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still be a non-empty iterable. Since the loop just consumed one element from `args`, `args` should now be a non-empty iterable with at least one element remaining.

State: **`at_start` is False, `k` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least one element remaining**
