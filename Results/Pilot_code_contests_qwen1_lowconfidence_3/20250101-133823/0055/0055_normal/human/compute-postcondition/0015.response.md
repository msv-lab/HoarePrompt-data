`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is a space `' '` in this case) to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values, but the action of writing a space to the standard output has occurred.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `k` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least one element remaining; a space is written to `sys.stdout`.**
