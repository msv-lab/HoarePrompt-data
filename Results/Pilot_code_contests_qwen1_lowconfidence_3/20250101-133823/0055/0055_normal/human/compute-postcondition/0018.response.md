The variable `at_start` is set to `False`. Since no other variables are affected by this line of code, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the updated value of `at_start`.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `k` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least one element remaining, and a string representation of `x` is written to `sys.stdout.`**
