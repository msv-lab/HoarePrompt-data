The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is a space) to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). This does not change the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `k` is an integer, `n` and `m` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must be a non-empty iterable**
