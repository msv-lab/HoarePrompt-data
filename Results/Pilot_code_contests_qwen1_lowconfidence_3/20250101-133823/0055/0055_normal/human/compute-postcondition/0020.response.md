The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` impacts the program by writing the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to `file`, which is `sys.stdout`. This means that `sys.stdout` will write the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, which defaults to a newline character `\n` if no value is provided in `kwargs`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `k` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, each element of `args` is written to `sys.stdout` with spaces between consecutive elements, `sys.stdout` writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` (defaulting to '\n')**
