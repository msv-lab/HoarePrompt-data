`at_start` is set to `False`. The values of `k`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `sep`, `file`, `args`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `k` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must be a non-empty iterable, `x` is written to `sys.stdout`**
