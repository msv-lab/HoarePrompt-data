The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `k`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`. 
- `k` is an integer representing the initial number of lines in the file.
- `n` is an integer representing the length of Monocarp's sequence of actions.
- `m` is an integer representing the length of Polycarp's sequence of actions.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 300.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer satisfies 0 ≤ `b_j` ≤ 300.

The function may return different outputs based on the logic implemented within it, but based on the given information, there are no explicit return statements provided. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept the parameters `k`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`, and perform some operations based on these parameters, although the specific operations are not detailed here.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `k`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`, where `k` is an integer, `n` and `m` are integers, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers, and performs operations based on these parameters.**
