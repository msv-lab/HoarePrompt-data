Postcondition: ***`at_start` is a boolean, `k` is an integer, `n` and `m` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must be a non-empty iterable. Since the condition `not at_start` is false in the if part, the overall state remains the same as the precondition: `at_start` is True, and all other variables retain their original values.***
