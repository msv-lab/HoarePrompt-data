The variable `at_start` is reassigned to `False`, which was its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is False, `k` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `sys.stdout` has a space written to it.
