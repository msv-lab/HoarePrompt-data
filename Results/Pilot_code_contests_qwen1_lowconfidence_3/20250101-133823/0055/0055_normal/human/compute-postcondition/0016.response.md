Postcondition: ***`at_start` is False, `k` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least one element remaining; if `not at_start` is True, a space is written to `sys.stdout`.***
