`file.flush()` is called, which flushes the output buffer of `file`, which is `sys.stdout`. However, the code does not assign any new value to `file`, `at_start`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `sep`, or `args`. Therefore, the only change is in the state of `sys.stdout`, which is flushed.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `k` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `sys.stdout` is flushed, the current value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` is '\n', the current value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`**
