The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is a space `' '` in this case) to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). This operation does not change the values of any variables but affects the content of `sys.stdout`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `k` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `sys.stdout` has a space written to it**
