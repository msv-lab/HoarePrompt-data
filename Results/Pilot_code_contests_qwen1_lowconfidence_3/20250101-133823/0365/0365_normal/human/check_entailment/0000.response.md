Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple edges with the same weight but different starting and ending vertices. The program only considers the maximum number of edges for each weight category independently, without ensuring that the path formed is valid according to the problem description. For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 1 2
```

In this case, the program should output `3` because the path can be \(1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3\) with weights 1 and 1, followed by \(3 \rightarrow 1\) with weight 2. However, the current implementation will only consider the last weight category (weight 2) and output 1, which is incorrect.
