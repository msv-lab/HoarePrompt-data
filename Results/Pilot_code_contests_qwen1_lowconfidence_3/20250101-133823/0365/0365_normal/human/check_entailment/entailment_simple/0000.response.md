Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of vertices \( n \) and edges \( m \) from the input.
   - It then reads \( m \) lines, each containing three space-separated integers \( u \), \( v \), and \( w \) representing a directed edge from vertex \( u \) to vertex \( v \) with weight \( w \).
   - This matches the problem description and input format.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is represented using an adjacency list where each weight from 1 to \( 10^5 \) is used as an index to store tuples of edge pairs.
   - This ensures that all edges with the same weight are grouped together.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - A memoization array `mem` of size \( n+1 \) is initialized to store the maximum number of edges in the path ending at each vertex.
   - For each weight \( w \) from 1 to \( 10^5 \), the program processes the edges with that weight.
   - For each edge \((u, v)\) with weight \( w \), it updates the `mem[v]` value to be the maximum of its current value and \( mem[u] + 1 \).
   - This ensures that the path is extended only if the next edge has a strictly greater weight.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the maximum value in the `mem` array, which represents the length of the longest path with strictly increasing edge weights.

Given the above points, the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all cases as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
