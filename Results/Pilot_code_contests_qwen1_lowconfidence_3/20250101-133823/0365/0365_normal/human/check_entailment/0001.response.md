Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of edges in a path where the weights of the edges strictly increase. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input using `rints` and `rints_2d` functions.
2. **Graph Representation**: It uses an array `weight` to group edges by their weights, which allows for efficient processing of edges with the same weight.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: The program uses dynamic programming to keep track of the longest path ending at each vertex for each possible edge weight. This ensures that the path found is valid according to the problem constraints.
4. **Edge Case Handling**: Since the graph does not contain self-loops or multiple edges, the program handles these constraints correctly.

Given the provided examples and the nature of the problem, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would cause the program to fail based on the problem description and examples provided.
