Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the code attempts to find the longest path with strictly increasing edge weights, but it does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it seems to attempt to find the longest path in a general sense without considering the strictly increasing weight condition.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
3 3
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

However, the provided code would output `1` because it does not properly account for the strictly increasing weight condition. The code updates the `mem` array based on the presence of edges, but it does not ensure that the weights are strictly increasing along the path.

A correct solution would need to maintain a dynamic programming table that tracks the longest path ending at each vertex for each possible weight. This would involve iterating through the edges and updating the table only if the current edge weight is strictly greater than the previous edge weight in the path.

Since the provided code does not handle the strictly increasing weight condition correctly, the output is incorrect for at least one case, making the program incorrect according to the problem description.
