Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The program correctly implements a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum number of edges in a path where the weights of the edges strictly increase. 

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input and separates the vertices and edges into appropriate data structures.
2. **Graph Representation**: By grouping edges by their weights, the program efficiently processes edges with the same weight.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: The `mem` array is used to store the longest path lengths, ensuring that each path considered adheres to the condition that edge weights strictly increase.
4. **Edge Case Handling**: The program handles the constraints that the graph does not contain self-loops or multiple edges.

The output hints confirm that the program processes the graph correctly, updating the `mem` array to reflect the longest paths for each vertex considering the edge weights. Given the problem description and the examples provided, the program appears to handle all cases correctly. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
