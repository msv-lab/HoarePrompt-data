Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the solution to the described problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input correctly using `stdin`. It first reads two integers `n` and `m`, representing the number of vertices and edges respectively.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing three integers `ui`, `vi`, and `wi`, representing a directed edge from vertex `ui` to vertex `vi` with weight `wi`.

2. **Graph Representation:**
   - The graph is represented using adjacency lists for each possible weight. Specifically, `weight[w]` is a list of tuples representing all unique edge pairs `(u, v)` where `w` is the weight associated with those edges.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The program uses dynamic programming to find the longest path with strictly increasing weights.
   - It initializes an array `mem` where `mem[v]` stores the maximum number of edges in a path ending at vertex `v`.
   - For each possible edge weight `i` from 1 to `10^5`, it constructs a list `all` of tuples `(v, mem[u])` for all edges with weight `i`.
   - It then iterates over these tuples and updates the `mem` array to ensure `mem[v]` is the maximum value between its current value and the sum of `du + 1`, where `du` is the distance from the source vertex to the current vertex.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the maximum value in the `mem` array, which represents the longest path from the starting vertex to any other vertex in the graph.

Given the above points, the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all the specified requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
