Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. The code attempts to find the longest path in a directed graph where each edge's weight strictly increases along the path. However, the implementation does not correctly handle the requirement that each subsequent edge must have a strictly greater weight than the previous one.

The key issue lies in the way the `mem` array is updated. The code updates the `mem` array with the maximum distance considering all edges with the same weight, but it does not ensure that the weights are strictly increasing along the path. Specifically, the code iterates over all edges with a particular weight and updates the `mem` array without checking if the weights are strictly increasing.

Here is an example that highlights the issue:

### Example Input:
```
6 7
1 2 1
3 2 5
2 4 2
2 5 2
2 6 9
5 4 3
4 3 4
```

### Expected Output:
```
6
```

### Actual Output:
The provided code will not produce the correct output for this case. It will likely produce a shorter path because it does not ensure the weights are strictly increasing.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to use dynamic programming or a similar approach to keep track of the maximum path length for each vertex considering the strictly increasing weight constraint.
