The function processes a directed graph represented by `n` vertices and `m` edges, where each edge has a weight between 1 and 10^5. It initializes an array `mem` to store the maximum distance (or path length) from a starting vertex to each vertex. For each possible edge weight, it constructs a list of tuples containing the destination vertex and the distance from the source vertex. It then iterates over these tuples to update the `mem` array, ensuring that `mem[v]` is the maximum value between its current value and the sum of `du + 1`, where `du` is the distance from the source vertex to the current vertex. After processing all possible edge weights, it prints the maximum value in the `mem` array, which represents the longest path from the starting vertex to any other vertex in the graph.
