n and m are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n·(n - 1), 3·10^5). The graph is represented by a list of edges, where each edge is a tuple (ui, vi, wi) indicating a directed edge from vertex ui to vertex vi with weight wi, and there are no self-loops or multiple edges in the graph.
