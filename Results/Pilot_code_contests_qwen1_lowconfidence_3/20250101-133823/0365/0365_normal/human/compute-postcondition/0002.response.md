The code `n, m = rints()` assigns the values read from the input using the function `rints` to the variables `n` and `m`. The values of `n` and `m` are specific integers where `2 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5` and `1 ≤ m ≤ min(n⋅(n - 1), 3⋅10^5)`. The function `rints_2d` is defined separately and is not directly impacted by this line of code. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 3⋅10^5 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and min(`n`⋅(`n` - 1), 3⋅10^5) (inclusive)**
