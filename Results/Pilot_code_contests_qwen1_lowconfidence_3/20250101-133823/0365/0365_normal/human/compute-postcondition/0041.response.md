Functionality: **The function processes a directed graph represented by `n` vertices and `m` edges, where each edge has a weight between 1 and 10^5. It initializes an array `mem` to store the maximum distance (or path length) from a starting vertex to each vertex. For each possible edge weight, it constructs a list of tuples containing the destination vertex and the distance from the source vertex. It then iterates over these tuples to update the `mem` array, ensuring that `mem[v]` is the maximum value between its current value and the sum of `du + 1`, where `du` is the distance from the source vertex to the current vertex. After processing all possible edge weights, it prints the maximum value in the `mem` array, which represents the longest path from the starting vertex to any other vertex in the graph.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the graph is disconnected, the function still computes the longest path within the connected components. However, it does not handle the case where the graph is completely disconnected (no paths exist between some components).
- The function assumes that the graph does not contain self-loops or multiple edges, as stated in the problem description. If such edges were present, the function would not behave as expected, potentially leading to incorrect results.
- The function does not explicitly check for negative weights, though the weights are given to be between 1 and 10^5, indicating non-negative weights. If negative weights were allowed, the function would need additional logic to handle them, such as using a different algorithm like Bellman-Ford.
