Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `weight` is a list of lists where each index corresponds to a weight and contains tuples of edge pairs, `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` that has been fully processed, `all` is a list of tuples `(v, du)` for each tuple `(u, v)` in `weight[m]` and must contain at least one tuple, `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` in `all`.**
