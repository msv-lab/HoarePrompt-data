The code initializes three variables: `mem`, `edges`, and `weight`. 

- `mem` is assigned a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.
- `edges` is assigned the result of a function `rints_2d(m)`, which we assume returns a 2D list of size `m`.
- `weight` is assigned a list of lists, where each sublist has a length of `10 ** 5 + 1`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not specified, we can only describe the structure and contents of these variables in terms of their lengths and types.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 3⋅10^5 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and min(`n`⋅(`n` - 1), 3⋅10^5) (inclusive), `mem` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `edges` is a 2D list of size `m`, `weight` is a list of `10 ** 5 + 1` sublists, each of which is empty**.
