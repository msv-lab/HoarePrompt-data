Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is `m + 2`
   - `m` must be less than 100001
   - `all` must contain at least one tuple
   - `v` is the first value from the next tuple in `all`
   - `du` is the second value from the next tuple in `all`
   - `mem[v]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   The loop iterates over each tuple `(v, du)` in the list `all`.

3. **What Changes?**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are tuples left in `all`.
   - `v` and `du` will be set to the values of the next tuple in `all`.
   - `mem[v]` is updated based on the value of `du`.

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `v` and `du` are already defined and correspond to the first tuple in `all`.
   - `all` should now contain at least one less tuple.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `all` must still contain at least one tuple.
   - `v` will be the first value of the next tuple in `all`.
   - `du` will be the second value of the next tuple in `all`.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - `total` remains 0 because the loop body is omitted.
   - `i` remains `m + 2` because it does not change within the loop.
   - `m` remains less than 100001 because it does not change within the loop.
   - `all` must now contain at least one tuple.
   - `v` will be the first value of the next tuple in `all`.
   - `du` will be the second value of the next tuple in `all`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `m + 2`, `m` must be less than 100001, `all` must contain at least one tuple, `v` is the first value from the next tuple in `all`, `du` is the second value from the next tuple in `all`**.
