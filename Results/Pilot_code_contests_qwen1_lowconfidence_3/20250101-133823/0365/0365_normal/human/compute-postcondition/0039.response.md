The code `print(max(mem))` attempts to print the maximum value from the `mem` list, but since `mem` is not defined in the given initial state, the code will raise a `NameError`. No variables are updated or affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 10**
