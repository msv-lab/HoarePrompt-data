The code updates `mem[v]` to be the maximum between its current value and `du + 1`. Here, `du` is a variable that is not defined in the given initial state, which means it must be defined within the context where this line of code is executed. Since no specific value or definition of `du` is provided, we cannot determine the exact updated value of `mem[v]`. However, we know that `mem[v]` will be set to the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`.

The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `m + 1`, `m` must be at least 1, `weight` is a list of lists where each index corresponds to a weight and contains tuples of edge pairs, `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` that has been fully processed, `all` is a list of tuples `(v, mem[u])` for each tuple `(u, v)` in `weight[i]` and must contain at least one tuple, `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`**.
