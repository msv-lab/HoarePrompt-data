The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it operates on input data that is presumably provided before or through some external means not shown in the function definition. The function processes a graph defined by the number of vertices `n` and the number of directed edges `m`, where each edge is represented by three integers `ui`, `vi`, and `wi`. After processing this graph, the function returns nothing explicitly (i.e., it returns `None`). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a graph defined by the number of vertices `n`, the number of directed edges `m`, and the edges themselves, and it returns nothing.

Functionality: **The function processes a graph defined by the number of vertices `n`, the number of directed edges `m`, and the edges themselves, and it returns nothing.**
