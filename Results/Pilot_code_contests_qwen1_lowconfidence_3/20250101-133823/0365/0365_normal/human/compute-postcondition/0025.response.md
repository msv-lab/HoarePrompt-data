The code snippet updates the value of `mem[v]` to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`. The value of `v` and `du` are not specified in the initial state, but we know that `mem[v]` is updated based on these values.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `m + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `weight` is a list of lists where each index corresponds to a weight and contains tuples of edge pairs, `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` that has been fully processed, `all` is a list of tuples `(v, du)` for each tuple `(u, v)` in `weight[i]` and must contain at least one tuple, `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`**
