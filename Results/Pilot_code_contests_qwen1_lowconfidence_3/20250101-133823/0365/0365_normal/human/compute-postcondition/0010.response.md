Output State: **`edges` is a 2D list of size `m` (or potentially smaller if the loop did not fully iterate over all elements due to list modifications during iteration); `weight[w]` is a list of tuples representing all unique edge pairs `(u, v)` where `w` is the weight associated with those edges, `mem` remains a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` that must have been fully processed if the loop completed successfully, `weight` is a list of lists where each index corresponds to a weight and contains tuples of edge pairs.**
