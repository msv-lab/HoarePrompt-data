Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `m + k` where `k` is the number of iterations of the loop, `m` must be less than 100001, `all` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `v` is the first value from the last tuple processed, `du` is the second value from the last tuple processed, `mem[v]` is the maximum of all values `du + 1` encountered during the loop iterations.**
