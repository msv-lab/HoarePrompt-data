Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is `m + 1`
   - `m` is at least 1
   - `weight` is a list of lists where each index corresponds to a weight and contains tuples of edge pairs
   - `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` that has been fully processed
   - `all` is a list of tuples `(v, du)` for each tuple `(u, v)` in `weight[i]` and must contain at least one tuple
   - `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for (v, du) in all:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `(v, du)` in the list `all`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the list `all` must contain at least one tuple.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `all` is a list of tuples derived from `weight[i]`, and it must contain at least one tuple for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `all` still contains at least one tuple.
   - The variable `i` is `m + 1`, meaning the loop is currently not running because `i` is out of bounds (since `all` is derived from `weight[i]` and `i` is `m + 1`).
   - To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to set `i` back to `m` or lower, ensuring that `all` is non-empty.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - To prepare for the next iteration, `i` should be set to `m` so that `all` is derived from `weight[m]`.
   - The condition for `all` to contain at least one tuple remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `m`, `m` is at least 1, `weight` is a list of lists where each index corresponds to a weight and contains tuples of edge pairs, `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` that has been fully processed, `all` is a list of tuples `(v, du)` for each tuple `(u, v)` in `weight[i]` and must contain at least one tuple, `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`**
