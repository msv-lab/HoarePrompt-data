The code initializes the list `all` by iterating over the `weight[i]` list and creating tuples of `(v, mem[u])` for each tuple `(u, v)` in `weight[i]`. Since `weight[i]` contains tuples of edge pairs, and `mem[v]` is the maximum of its current value and `du + 1` for all tuples `(v, du)` in `all`, the value of `all` is now constructed based on these conditions.

Given that `weight[i]` contains tuples of edge pairs, let's denote a generic tuple from `weight[i]` as `(u, v)`. For each such tuple, `all` will contain the tuple `(v, mem[u])`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `m + 1`, `m` must be at least 1, `weight` is a list of lists where each index corresponds to a weight and contains tuples of edge pairs, `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` that has been fully processed, `all` is a list of tuples `(v, mem[u])` for each tuple `(u, v)` in `weight[i]`, `mem[v]` is the maximum of its current value and `du + 1` for all tuples `(v, du)` in `all`.**
