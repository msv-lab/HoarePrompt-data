Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `10**5 + 1`, `m` is a non-negative integer less than `10**5`, `weight` is a list of lists where each index corresponds to a weight and contains tuples of edge pairs, `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` that has been fully processed, `all` is a list of tuples `(v, du)` for each tuple `(u, v)` in `weight[m]` and must contain all tuples, `mem[v]` is the maximum of all values `du + 1` encountered during the loop iterations for all tuples `(v, du)` in `all`.**

### Explanation:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `10**5 + 1`. This means that if the loop completes successfully, `i` will be `10**5 + 1`.

2. **Value of `i`**: After the loop finishes, `i` will be `10**5 + 1` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `10**5 + 1`.

3. **Value of `m`**: The loop will only complete if `m` is a non-negative integer less than `10**5`. If `m` were greater than or equal to `10**5`, the loop would not complete due to the condition `i < 10**5 + 1`.

4. **State of `weight` and `edges`**: Since the loop processes all elements of `edges` completely, `m` must represent the size of `edges` that was fully processed. The `weight` list remains unchanged as the loop updates `mem` based on its content but does not modify `weight`.

5. **State of `all`**: After processing all tuples in `weight[m]`, `all` will contain all tuples `(v, du)` from `weight[m]`.

6. **State of `mem`**: The variable `mem` is updated such that `mem[v]` becomes the maximum of its current value and `du + 1` for all tuples `(v, du)` in `all`. This update happens for every tuple processed in the loop, ensuring that `mem[v]` contains the maximum path length (or some derived value) up to vertex `v`.

By following these steps and considering the constraints and operations within the loop, we can conclude the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
