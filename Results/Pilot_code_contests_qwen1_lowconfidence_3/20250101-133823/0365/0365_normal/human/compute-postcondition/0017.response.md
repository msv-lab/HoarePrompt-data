Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is 2
   - `m` must be at least 1
   - `weight[1]` must contain at least one tuple
   - `mem` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros
   - `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` that must have been fully processed if the loop completed successfully
   - `all` is a list of tuples generated from the current value of `weight[1]` where each tuple is `(v, mem[u])` for each edge pair `(u, v)` in `weight[1]`
   - `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1` for each tuple `(v, du)` in `all`

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(v, du)` in `all`.

3. **State Adjustment for Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `all`, it means that the current tuple `(v, du)` being processed in the loop is the last tuple in `all`.
   - After processing this tuple, the loop will exit if there are no more tuples in `all`.

4. **Updated States**:
   - The variable `v` and `du` will be the values of the last tuple `(v, du)` in `all`.
   - The list `all` will be empty because the loop will have processed all tuples.

5. **Summary of Updated States**:
   - `total` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` remains 2 as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `m` remains at least 1 unless the loop was unable to process all tuples due to an error or termination condition, but based on the given information, `m` remains valid.
   - `weight[1]` remains the same.
   - `mem` remains the same.
   - `edges` remains the same.
   - `all` becomes an empty list since all tuples have been processed.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `m` must be at least 1, `weight[1]` must contain at least one tuple, `mem` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` that must have been fully processed if the loop completed successfully, `all` is an empty list**.
