Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `m` must be at least 1, `weight` is a list of lists where each index corresponds to a weight and contains tuples of edge pairs, `mem` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` that must have been fully processed if the loop completed successfully, `all` is a list of tuples generated from the current value of `weight[i]` where each tuple is `(v, mem[u])` for each edge pair `(u, v)` in `weight[i]`.**
