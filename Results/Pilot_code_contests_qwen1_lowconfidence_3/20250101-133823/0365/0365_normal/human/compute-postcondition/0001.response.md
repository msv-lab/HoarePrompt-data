The code `rints_2d = lambda n: [rints() for _ in range(n)]` defines a lambda function `rints_2d` that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` tuples, each tuple being the result of calling the `rints` function. The `rints` function is assumed to read two integers (as per the initial state description).

However, the given code does not execute the function or modify any variables outside the scope of this lambda definition. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **The input consists of two integers n and m, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n⋅(n - 1), 3⋅10^5); following these, m lines each contain three space-separated integers ui, vi, and wi, representing a directed edge from vertex ui to vertex vi with weight wi, where 1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 10^5; a function `rints` is defined to read these inputs; a lambda function `rints_2d` is defined which reads n such tuples using `rints` function.**
