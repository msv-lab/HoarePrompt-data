Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Initial State:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is `m`
- `m` must be at least 1
- `weight` is a list of lists where each index corresponds to a weight and contains tuples of edge pairs
- `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` that has been fully processed
- `all` is an empty list
- `mem[v]` is the maximum of its current value and `du + 1` for all tuples `(v, du)` in `all`

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(1, 10 ** 5 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop runs from `1` to `10 ** 5 + 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m`.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- Therefore, `i` will become `m + 1`.

### Adjusted States:
- `total` remains `0` as there is no indication that `total` changes within the loop.
- `i` is updated to `m + 1`.
- `m` must still be at least 1, but this condition does not change since we only updated `i`.
- `weight` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
- `edges` remains a 2D list of size `m` as it is also not involved in the loop.
- `all` remains an empty list as it is not involved in the loop.
- `mem[v]` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.

### Final State:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `m + 1`, `m` must be at least 1, `weight` is a list of lists where each index corresponds to a weight and contains tuples of edge pairs, `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` that has been fully processed, `all` is an empty list, `mem[v]` is the maximum of its current value and `du + 1` for all tuples `(v, du)` in `all`.**
