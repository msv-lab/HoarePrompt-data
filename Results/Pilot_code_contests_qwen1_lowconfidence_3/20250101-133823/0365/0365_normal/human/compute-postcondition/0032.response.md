`mem[v]` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `du + 1`. Since `v` is the first value from the tuple and `du` is the second value from the tuple in the list `all`, the value of `v` and `du` will be taken from one of the tuples in `all`. The other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `i` is `m + 1`, `m` must be less than 100001, `all` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `v` is the first value from the tuple, `du` is the second value from the tuple, and `mem[v]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `m + 1`, `m` must be less than 100001, `all` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `v` is the first value from the tuple, `du` is the second value from the tuple, `mem[v]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`.**
