The code provided is a lambda function named `rints` which reads a line from standard input and splits it into integers. This function does not affect any existing variables but prepares to read input data. Given the initial state includes the number of vertices `n`, the number of edges `m`, and the subsequent lines containing edge details, the `rints` function will be used to read these inputs.

Output State: **The input consists of two integers n and m, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n⋅(n - 1), 3⋅10^5); following these, m lines each contain three space-separated integers ui, vi, and wi, representing a directed edge from vertex ui to vertex vi with weight wi, where 1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 10^5; a function `rints` is defined to read these inputs.**
