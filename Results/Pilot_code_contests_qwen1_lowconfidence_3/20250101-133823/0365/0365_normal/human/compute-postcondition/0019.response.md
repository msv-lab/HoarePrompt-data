Let's analyze the loop and deduce the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `total` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `m` must be at least 1
- `weight` is a list of lists where each index corresponds to a weight and contains tuples of edge pairs
- `mem` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros
- `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` that must have been fully processed if the loop completed successfully
- `all` is a list of tuples generated from the current value of `weight[i]` where each tuple is `(v, mem[u])` for each edge pair `(u, v)` in `weight[i]`

### Loop Code
```python
for v, du in all:
    mem[v] = max(mem[v], du + 1)
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(v, du)` in `all`. For each iteration, it updates the `mem[v]` value to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`.

2. **Variable Values After Loop Completion**:
   - `total`: Remains unchanged at 0 because the loop does not modify `total`.
   - `i`: Will be the last value of `i` when the loop terminates. Since the loop increments `i` at the start of each iteration, `i` will be `m` when the loop completes.
   - `m`: Must be at least 1.
   - `weight`: Unchanged, remains as a list of lists.
   - `edges`: Unchanged, remains as a 2D list of size `m` that has been fully processed.
   - `all`: Will be an empty list after the loop completes because there are no more tuples in `all` to process.
   - `mem`: Each element `mem[v]` will hold the maximum value of `du + 1` for all tuples `(v, du)` in `all`.

### Final State
After the loop completes, the values of the variables will be:
- `total` is 0.
- `i` is `m`.
- `m` must be at least 1.
- `weight` is a list of lists where each index corresponds to a weight and contains tuples of edge pairs.
- `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` that has been fully processed.
- `all` is an empty list.
- `mem[v]` for each `v` in the range `0` to `n` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1` for all tuples `(v, du)` in `all`.

### Output State
Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `m`, `m` must be at least 1, `weight` is a list of lists where each index corresponds to a weight and contains tuples of edge pairs, `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` that has been fully processed, `all` is an empty list, `mem[v]` is the maximum of its current value and `du + 1` for all tuples `(v, du)` in `all`.**
