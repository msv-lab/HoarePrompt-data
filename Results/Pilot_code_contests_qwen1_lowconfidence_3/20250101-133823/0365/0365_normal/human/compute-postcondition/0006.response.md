Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` that must have at least one element.
   - `weight[w]` is a list that now contains an additional tuple `(u, v)`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for (u, v, w) in edges:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `(u, v, w)` in the `edges` list.
   - After each iteration, `edges` loses one tuple.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `edges` still has at least one element (since it had at least one element initially).
   - `weight[w]` now contains an additional tuple `(u, v)`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `edges` must still contain at least one tuple.
   - Therefore, we need to reduce the size of `edges` by one tuple.

6. **Updated States:**
   - `edges` must have at least one element, but it has lost one tuple from the previous iteration, so it now has at least one element minus one tuple.
   - `weight[w]` remains unchanged as the loop body does not modify it.

Based on this reasoning, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`edges` is a 2D list of size `m-1` that must have at least one element; `weight[w]` is a list that now contains an additional tuple `(u, v)`**
