According to the code, the loop condition is `for i in range(1, 10 ** 5 + 1)`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is between 1 and 100000 inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m`, and `m` is a positive integer.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to check if the loop can continue executing. The loop will continue if `i` (which is now `m`) is less than 100001. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be less than 100001.

Let's summarize the states that need to be adjusted:

- `total` remains 0 since it is not affected by the loop.
- `i` will be incremented by 1 from `m` to `m+1`.
- `m` must be less than 100001 for the loop to continue.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `m+1`, `m` must be less than 100001**
