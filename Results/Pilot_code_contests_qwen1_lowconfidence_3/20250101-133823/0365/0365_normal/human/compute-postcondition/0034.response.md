The code updates the value of `mem[v]` to the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`. The values of `total`, `i`, `m`, `all`, `v`, and `du` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `i` is `m + 2`, `m` must be less than 100001, `all` must contain at least one tuple, `v` is the first value from the next tuple in `all`, `du` is the second value from the next tuple in `all`, and `mem[v]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `m + 2`, `m` must be less than 100001, `all` must contain at least one tuple, `v` is the first value from the next tuple in `all`, `du` is the second value from the next tuple in `all`, `mem[v]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`**
