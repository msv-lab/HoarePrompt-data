Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and mod is a positive integer.**

Note: The provided function `func_9` does not seem to relate directly to the problem description. It appears to be calculating factorials modulo `mod`, which is not relevant to finding the minimum possible weakness of the sequence as described. This function seems to be part of a different, unrelated functionality.
