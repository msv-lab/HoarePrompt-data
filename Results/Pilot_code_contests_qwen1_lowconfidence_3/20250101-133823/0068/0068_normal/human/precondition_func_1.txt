None of the variables are explicitly defined or passed within the function signature of `func_2`. However, it is implied that `func_3` is a function that returns a string containing space-separated integers representing the sequence `a1, a2, ..., an`, where `n` is the length of the sequence. The length of the sequence `n` is expected to be read from the first line of input and should satisfy `1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000`. Each element `ai` in the sequence should satisfy `|ai| ≤ 10 000`.
