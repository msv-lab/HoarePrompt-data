The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns a map object. This map object converts each string in the list returned by `func_3().split()` into an integer. There are no additional actions performed beyond this conversion. It is assumed that `func_3()` returns a string containing space-separated integers, and the function `func_1` processes these integers accordingly. If `func_3()` returns an empty string or a string with no space-separated values, the resulting map object will be empty. No further processing or validation of the integers is performed by `func_1`.
