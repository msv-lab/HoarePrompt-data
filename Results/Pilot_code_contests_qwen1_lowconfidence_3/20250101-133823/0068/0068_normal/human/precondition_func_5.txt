n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the length of the sequence; a is a list of n integers where each integer ai satisfies |ai| ≤ 10,000; l and r are integers representing the initial search range for x, set to -100,005 and 100,05 respectively; h is an integer representing the step size for binary search refinement, initially set to 101; ans is a float representing the current best found value for the minimum weakness, initialized to infinity (or a very large number); f is a function that takes a real number x and the list a, and returns the weakness of the sequence a1 - x, a2 - x, ..., an - x.
