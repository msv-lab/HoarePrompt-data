The function `func_7` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns a list `ans` where each element is 2 raised to the power of the index `i` for which the binary representation of `x` has a '1' at that index. 

Here is a detailed breakdown of the function's actions and final state:
1. The function initializes an empty list `v` to store the binary representation of `x`.
2. It then enters a loop where it repeatedly appends the remainder of `x` divided by 2 (i.e., `x % 2`) to `v` and updates `x` to be the integer division of `x` by 2 (i.e., `int(x / 2)`). This process continues until `x` becomes 0. At the end of this loop, `x` is 0 and `v` contains the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order.
3. The function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the result.
4. It iterates over the indices of `v`. For each index `i` where `v[i]` is 1, it appends `2
