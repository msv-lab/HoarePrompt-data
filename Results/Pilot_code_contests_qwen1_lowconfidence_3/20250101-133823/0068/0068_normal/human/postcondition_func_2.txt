The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and prompts the user to enter some input. It then returns the user's input as a string. This function is useful for obtaining user input in a program. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, but it's worth noting that the function does not handle cases where the user might exit the program by entering Ctrl+D (EOFError) or Ctrl+C (KeyboardInterrupt) on systems that support these signals.
