`ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value of `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1. Therefore, `2 ** i` evaluates to `2 ** 1`, which is 2. The list `ans` initially contains the value 1, and after appending 2, it will contain `[1, 2]`. The values of the other variables (`x`, `v`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `v` is "0", `ans` is [1, 2], and `i` is 1**
