The code `r = min(r, rr)` updates the value of `r` to be the minimum of its current value and `rr`. Given the initial conditions:

- `l` is `max(l, ll)`
- `r` is within the range `[l, r]`
- `ll` is within the range `[ll, rr]`
- `rr` is within the range `[l, r]`

Since `r` is within the range `[l, r]` and `rr` is within the range `[l, rr]`, the new value of `r` will be the minimum of `r` and `rr`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`l` is `max(l, ll)`, `r` is the minimum of `r` and `rr`, `ll` is within the range `[ll, rr]`, and `rr` is within the range `[l, r]`**
