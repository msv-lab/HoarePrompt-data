Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies |\( a_i \)| ≤ 10000; `l` is the final left bound after all iterations; `r` is the final right bound after all iterations; `h` is 1; `ans` is the minimum of `p`, `q`, and `i_m` updated to be `min(ans, p, q)`; `m1` is `l + (r - l) / 3`; `m2` is `r - (r - l) / 3`; `p` is the value returned by `f(m1, a)`, `q` is the value returned by `f(m2, a)`**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `h > 0`.
- After each iteration, `h` decreases by 1.
- The values of `l` and `r` are adjusted based on the comparison of `p` and `q`:
  - If `p <= q`, then `r` is updated to `m2`.
  - If `p > q`, then `l` is updated to `m1`.
- Eventually, `h` reaches 0, and the loop terminates.
- At this point, `l` and `r` converge to the optimal interval that minimizes the function `f(x, a)`.
- `ans` holds the minimum value of `p`, `q`, and the initial value `i_m` after all iterations.
