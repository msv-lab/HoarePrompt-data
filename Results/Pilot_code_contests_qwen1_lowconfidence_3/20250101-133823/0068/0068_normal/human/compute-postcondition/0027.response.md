Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies |`ai`| ≤ 10000; `l` is -100005; `r` is 100005; `h` is 99; `ans` is the minimum of `p`, `q`, and `i_m`; `m1` is -33335; `m2` is 33335; `p` is the value returned by `f(m1, a)`, `q` is the value returned by `f(m2, a)`, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `p`, `q`, and `ans`. If `p` is less than or equal to `q`, `l` is updated to 33335 and `r` is updated to 100005; otherwise, `l` is updated to -100005 and `r` is updated to 33335.***
