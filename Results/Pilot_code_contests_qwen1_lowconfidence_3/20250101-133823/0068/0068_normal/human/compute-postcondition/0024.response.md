The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is a non-negative integer. The function returns a list `ans` where each element is 2 raised to the power of the index `i` for which `v[i]` is '1'. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to accept a non-negative integer `x` and return a list where each element corresponds to the power of 2 at the index `i` for which the binary representation of `x` has a '1' at that index.
