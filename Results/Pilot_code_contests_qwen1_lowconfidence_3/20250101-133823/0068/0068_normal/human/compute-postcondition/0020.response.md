The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `2 ** i` equals 1. This value is appended to `ans`, which initially is `[1, 2]`. After appending, `ans` becomes `[1, 2, 1]`. The values of `x`, `v`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `v` is "0", `ans` is [1, 2, 1], `i` is 0**
