The function `func_8` accepts four parameters: `l`, `r`, `ll`, and `rr`. All of these parameters are integers such that `l` <= `r` and `ll` <= `rr`.

- In Case_1, the function returns -1.
- In Case_2, the function returns `max(0, r - l)`, where `r` is the minimum of `r` and `rr`, and `l` is the maximum of `l` and `ll`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_8` is to accept four integer parameters `l`, `r`, `ll`, and `rr`, and return -1 in one case and `max(0, r - l)` in another case based on the conditions provided.
