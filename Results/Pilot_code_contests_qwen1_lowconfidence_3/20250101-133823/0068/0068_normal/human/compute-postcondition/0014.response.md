The code `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value of `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is not defined in the initial state, and there's no prior definition or assignment to `i` within the provided code snippet, `i` retains its default value, which is `0`.

When `i` is `0`, `2 ** i` evaluates to `2 ** 0`, which is `1`. Therefore, the list `ans` will have the value `[1]` after the append operation.

The output state is:
Output State: **`x` is 0, `v` is "0", `ans` is [1]**
