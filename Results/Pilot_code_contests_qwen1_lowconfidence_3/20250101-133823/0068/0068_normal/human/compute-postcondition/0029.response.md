`h` is decreased by 1, so the new value of `h` is `h - 1`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `h` and retains the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies |a_i| ≤ 10000; `l` is -100005; `r` is 100005; `h` is `h - 1`; `ans` is the minimum of p, q, and i_m; `m1` is -33335; `m2` is 33335; `p` is the value returned by f(m1, a); `q` is the value returned by f(m2, a); if p is less than or equal to q, l is updated to 33335 and r is updated to 100005; otherwise, l is updated to -100005 and r is updated to 33335.**
