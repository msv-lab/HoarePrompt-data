Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step by step.

### Initial State
- `x` is a non-negative integer.
- `v` is an empty list.

### Loop Code
```python
while x > 0:
    v.append(int(x % 2))
    x = int(x / 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### After 1 Iteration
- `x` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, now equal to `floor(x / 2)`.
- `v` is appended with `int(x % 2)`, which is either 0 or 1.
- Therefore, `v` contains one element: `0` or `1`.

#### After 2 Iterations
- `x` is now `floor(initial_x / 4)`.
- `v` contains two elements: `int(initial_x % 2)` and `int((initial_x // 2) % 2)`.

#### After 3 Iterations
- `x` is now `floor(initial_x / 8)`.
- `v` contains three elements: `int(initial_x % 2)`, `int((initial_x // 2) % 2)`, and `int((initial_x // 4) % 2)`.

From the above steps, we can generalize the behavior of the loop:
- Each iteration appends the least significant bit (LSB) of `x` to the list `v`.
- After each iteration, `x` is halved (floored).

### Final State
- When the loop terminates, `x` will be 0 because the condition `x > 0` fails.
- At this point, `v` will contain the binary representation of the initial value of `x` in reverse order (since the bits are added from the least significant to the most significant).

### Output State
- `x` is 0.
- `v` contains the binary representation of the initial value of `x` in reverse order.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`x` is 0, `v` contains the binary representation of the initial value of `x` in reverse order**
