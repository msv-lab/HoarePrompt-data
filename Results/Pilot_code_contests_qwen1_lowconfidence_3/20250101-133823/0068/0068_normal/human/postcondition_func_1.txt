The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers. These integers are derived from a space-separated string returned by `func_3()`. The length of the list is determined by the first line of input, which should contain a single integer `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000`). Each integer in the list satisfies `|ai| ≤ 10 000`. The function processes the input string from `func_3()` into a list of integers, ensuring that the constraints on the values are met.
