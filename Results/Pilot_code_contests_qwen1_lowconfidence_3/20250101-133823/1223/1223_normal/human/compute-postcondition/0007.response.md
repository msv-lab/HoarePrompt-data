`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file `file`. Since no specific value for `x` is given, `x` remains as it is, but it is now written to `file`. The precondition that `at_start` is `False` and `args` contains at least one element is maintained, and the state of `sep` is not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length 4, `sep` and `file` are set based on `kwargs` or default values, `x` is unchanged but its string representation is written to `file`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` contains at least one element.**
