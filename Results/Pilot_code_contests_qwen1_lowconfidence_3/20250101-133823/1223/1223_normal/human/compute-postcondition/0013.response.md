The line `at_start = False` simply sets the variable `at_start` to `False`. The value of `S`, `sep`, `file`, `x`, and `args` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `at_start`.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length 4, `sep` and `file` are set based on `kwargs` or default values, `x` is unchanged, `at_start` is False, and `args` contains at least two elements, and the string representation of `x` is written to `file`.**
