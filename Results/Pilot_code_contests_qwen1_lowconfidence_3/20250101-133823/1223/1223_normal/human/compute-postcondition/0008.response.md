The line `at_start = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `at_start`. No other changes are made to the variables `S`, `sep`, `file`, `x`, `args`, or `at_start`. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`S` is a string of length 4, `sep` and `file` are set based on `kwargs` or default values, `x` is unchanged but its string representation is written to `file`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` contains at least one element.**
