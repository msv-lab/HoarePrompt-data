The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` into the file. This operation affects the file content but does not change the values of the other variables. The state of `S`, `x`, `at_start`, and the contents of `args` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length 4, `x` is unchanged, `at_start` is False, and `args` contains at least two elements; if `at_start` is False, `sep` is written into `file`, file now contains `str(x)`**
