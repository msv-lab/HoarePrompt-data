The variable `at_start` is set to `False`. This does not affect the other variables, so the output state is: `S` is a string of length 4, `x` is unchanged, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` contains at least two elements; if `at_start` is `False`, `sep` is written into `file`, file now contains `str(x)`.
