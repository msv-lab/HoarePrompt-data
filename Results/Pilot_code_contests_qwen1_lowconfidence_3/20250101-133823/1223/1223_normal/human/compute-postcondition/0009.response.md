According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop will continue as long as `args` contains at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were true:
- `S` is a string of length 4.
- `sep` and `file` are set based on `kwargs` or default values.
- `x` is unchanged but its string representation is written to `file`.
- `at_start` is `False`.
- `args` contains at least one element.

For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `args` is adjusted to reflect this condition.

State: **`S` is a string of length 4, `sep` and `file` are set based on `kwargs` or default values, `x` is unchanged but its string representation is written to `file`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` contains at least two elements**.
