The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of `S`, `sep`, or `file`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length 4 consisting of uppercase English letters, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` if `'sep'` is in `kwargs` or `' '`, `file` is either the value of `kwargs['file']` if `'file'` is in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`**
