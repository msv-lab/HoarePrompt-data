`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. The value of `x` is unchanged, but now `file` will contain the string representation of `x`. The states of the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length 4, `sep` and `file` are set based on `kwargs` or default values, `x` is unchanged, `at_start` remains `False`, and `args` contains at least two elements, and the string representation of `x` is written to `file`.**
