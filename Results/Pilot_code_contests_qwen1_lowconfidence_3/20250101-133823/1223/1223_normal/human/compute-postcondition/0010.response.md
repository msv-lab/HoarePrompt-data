The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to `file`. The variables `S`, `x`, `at_start`, and `args` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`S` is a string of length 4, `sep` and `file` are set based on `kwargs` or default values, `x` is unchanged but its string representation is written to `file`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` contains at least two elements**
