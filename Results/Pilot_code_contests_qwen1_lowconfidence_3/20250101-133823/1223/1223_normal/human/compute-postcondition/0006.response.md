Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length 4, `sep` and `file` are set based on `kwargs` or default values. If `at_start` is `False` and `args` contains at least one element, `file` now contains the written `sep`. No postcondition is provided for the else part, implying no changes occur in this case.***
