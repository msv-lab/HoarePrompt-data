Functionality: **The function `func_2` takes a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It constructs a string by iterating over the positional arguments, separating them with a specified separator (`sep`), and writes the resulting string to a specified output stream (`file`). If the `end` keyword argument is provided, it appends it to the end of the string before writing. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, it flushes the output buffer. The function does not return any value.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If no positional arguments are provided, the function will not write anything to the output stream.
- If the `end` keyword argument is not provided, a newline character (`\n`) is appended by default.
- If the `flush` keyword argument is not provided, the output buffer is not flushed.
- The function assumes that the `sys` module is available and that `kwargs` is a dictionary-like object. If these assumptions do not hold, the function will raise an error.
- The function does not validate the type of `args`; it will attempt to convert each element to a string, which may fail if the elements are not compatible.
- The function does not modify the original string `S` mentioned in the initial comment; it only uses the `sep` and `file` keyword arguments to construct and write the output string.
