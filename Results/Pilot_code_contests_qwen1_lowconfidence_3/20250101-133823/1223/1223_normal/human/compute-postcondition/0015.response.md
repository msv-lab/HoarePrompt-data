The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` into the file `file`. The other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the value of `sep` is written into the file.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length 4, `x` is unchanged, `at_start` is False, and `args` contains at least two elements; `sep` is written into `file`**
