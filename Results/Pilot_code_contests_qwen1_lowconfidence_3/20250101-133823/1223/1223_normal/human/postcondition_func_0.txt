The function `func_1` takes no explicit parameters and does not return anything. It first counts the occurrences of each character in a 4-character string `s` (consisting of uppercase English letters) and stores these counts in the variable `s`. Then, it calls the function `func_2` with either 'Yes' or 'No' based on whether the counts stored in `s` are exactly `[2, 2]`. If the counts are not `[2, 2]`, `func_2` is called with 'No'. If the counts are `[2, 2]`, `func_2` is called with 'Yes'.
