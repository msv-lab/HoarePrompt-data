Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the 4-character string `S` consists of exactly two kinds of characters which both appear twice in `S`. 

The issue lies in the usage of `Counter(input()).values()` in `func_1()`. This approach checks if the counts of the characters in the string are `[2, 2]`, but it does not ensure that there are exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice. 

For example, consider the input "AAAA":
- The counts of the characters would be `[4]`, which does not match `[2, 2]`.
- Therefore, the program would incorrectly output `No`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that there are exactly two distinct characters and each appears exactly twice. Here is a corrected version:

```python
from collections import Counter

def check_string(s):
    char_counts = Counter(s)
    # Check if there are exactly two distinct characters and each appears exactly twice
    return len(char_counts) == 2 and all(count == 2 for count in char_counts.values())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = input().strip()
    if len(s) != 4 or not s.isupper():
        print("No")
    elif check_string(s):
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")
```

This version correctly checks if the string `S` has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing twice.
