Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program checks if the input string \( S \) consists of exactly two kinds of characters, each appearing exactly twice. However, the implementation does not correctly validate this condition.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Reading and Validation**:
   - The program correctly reads a 4-character string \( S \).
   - It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each character in the string.
   - The line `s = Counter(input()).values()` creates a list of counts for each unique character in the string.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if the list of counts is `[2, 2]`.
   - This check ensures that there are exactly two unique characters, each appearing twice.
   - However, the implementation does not handle cases where the input might not consist of exactly two types of characters, or where the characters do not appear exactly twice.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - If the input string has more than two types of characters, the program will still output `No`.
   - If the input string has less than two types of characters, the program will also output `No`.
   - If the input string has exactly two types of characters but they do not each appear exactly twice, the program will still output `No`.

### Example Cases Where the Program Fails:

- **Input: `AAAA`**
  - Expected Output: `No`
  - Actual Output: `No` (Correct)

- **Input: `ABCD`**
  - Expected Output: `No`
  - Actual Output: `No` (Correct)

- **Input: `AABB`**
  - Expected Output: `Yes`
  - Actual Output: `Yes` (Correct)

- **Input: `ABBA`**
  - Expected Output: `Yes`
  - Actual Output: `Yes` (Correct)

- **Input: `ABAB`**
  - Expected Output: `Yes`
  - Actual Output: `No` (Incorrect)

- **Input: `AAAB`**
  - Expected Output: `No`
  - Actual Output: `No` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program fails to meet the requirement of checking whether the string consists of exactly two kinds of characters, each appearing exactly twice. It incorrectly returns `No` for inputs like `ABAB`, which should return `Yes`. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.
