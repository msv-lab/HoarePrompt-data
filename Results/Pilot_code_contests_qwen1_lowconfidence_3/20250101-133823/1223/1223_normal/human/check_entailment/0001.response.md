Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if the input string `S` consists of exactly two kinds of characters, each appearing twice. Here's the reasoning:

1. The program uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each character in the string.
2. It then checks if the counts of these characters form exactly two groups, each with a count of 2.
3. The function `func_2` prints `Yes` if the condition is met and `No` otherwise.

Given the constraints (the length of `S` is always 4), the only way to satisfy the condition is if there are exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. 

For example:
- `ASSA` has 'A' and 'S', each appearing twice, so it prints `Yes`.
- `STOP` does not have exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice, so it prints `No`.
- `FFEE` has 'F' and 'E', each appearing twice, so it prints `Yes`.
- `FREE` does not have exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice, so it prints `No`.

The provided code handles all potential cases correctly based on the problem description.
