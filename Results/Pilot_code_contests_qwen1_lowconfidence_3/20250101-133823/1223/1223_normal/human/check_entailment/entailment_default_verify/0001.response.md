Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly checks if the input string `S` consists of exactly two kinds of characters, each appearing twice. The function `func_1` uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each character and then checks if the counts form exactly two groups, each with a count of 2. The function `func_2` prints `Yes` if the condition is met and `No` otherwise. Given the constraints and the examples provided, the program behaves as expected and meets the problem description. The output hints for `func_2` confirm that it correctly formats and prints the output string according to the specified parameters. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is valid.
