You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
import os
import sys
from collections import Counter
from io import BytesIO, IOBase
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = Counter(input()).values()
    func_2('Yes' if s == [2, 2] else 'No')

#Function 2:
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if the input string `S` consists of exactly two kinds of characters, each appearing twice. Here's the reasoning:

1. The program uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each character in the string.
2. It then checks if the counts of these characters form exactly two groups, each with a count of 2.
3. The function `func_2` prints `Yes` if the condition is met and `No` otherwise.

Given the constraints (the length of `S` is always 4), the only way to satisfy the condition is if there are exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. 

For example:
- `ASSA` has 'A' and 'S', each appearing twice, so it prints `Yes`.
- `STOP` does not have exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice, so it prints `No`.
- `FFEE` has 'F' and 'E', each appearing twice, so it prints `Yes`.
- `FREE` does not have exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice, so it prints `No`.

The provided code handles all potential cases correctly based on the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` takes a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It constructs a string by iterating over the positional arguments, separating them with a specified separator (`sep`), and writes the resulting string to a specified output stream (`file`). If the `end` keyword argument is provided, it appends it to the end of the string before writing. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, it flushes the output buffer. The function does not return any value.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
