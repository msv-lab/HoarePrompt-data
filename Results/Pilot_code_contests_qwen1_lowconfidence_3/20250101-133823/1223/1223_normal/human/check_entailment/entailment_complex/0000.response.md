Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the code checks if the counts of characters in the string are exactly `[2, 2]`, which is not sufficient to meet the requirement of having exactly two kinds of characters, each appearing twice.

To meet the problem description, the program should check if the string `S` contains exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. However, the current implementation simply checks if the counts of characters are `[2, 2]`, which fails to account for cases where the string might contain more than two distinct characters, or where the characters do not appear exactly twice.

For example, consider the input "ABCD". The code would incorrectly output "Yes" because the counts of characters are `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, which does not match `[2, 2]`. However, according to the problem description, "ABCD" should output "No" because it does not consist of exactly two kinds of characters each appearing twice.

Thus, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case and therefore is incorrect.
