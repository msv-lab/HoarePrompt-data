Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies the program as meeting the problem description. Based on the annotated version, the program consistently adheres to the requirements:

1. **Function `func_1`**: The program reads a 4-character string `s` consisting of uppercase English letters using `Counter(input())`. It then checks if the counts of characters in `s` are exactly `[2, 2]`, which indicates that there are exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice. If this condition is met, it calls `func_2` with 'Yes'; otherwise, it calls `func_2` with 'No'. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function prints the result ('Yes' or 'No') to the standard output stream, which is consistent with the problem statement that requires printing `Yes` or `No` based on the condition.

The annotated version clarifies that the program correctly processes the input string and checks the required conditions. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
