n is an integer representing the number of cities in Byteforces, m is an integer representing the number of cities being attacked, numbers_of_attacked_cities is a list of m distinct integers representing the cities being attacked, and adjacents_list is a list of length n where each element is a list of integers representing the adjacent cities for the corresponding city index. Additionally, pi, heights1, distances1, and distances2 are pre-defined variables used within the program, and num_of_attacked_cities is a list containing the indices of the cities being attacked.
