The function `func_3` takes four parameters: `n` (number of cities), `m` (number of cities being attacked), `numbers_of_attacked_cities` (a list of indices of cities being attacked), and `adjacents_list` (a list of lists representing adjacency information). The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to compute a topological order of cities and updates two height arrays (`heights1` and `heights2`) based on the DFS traversal. Specifically, it sets `heights1[pi[v]]` and `heights2[pi[v]]` to the maximum height from the predecessor to `v` considering certain constraints. The function modifies the `visited` list to mark all cities as visited and clears the `adjacents_list` entries for cities that were popped from the stack during the DFS.
