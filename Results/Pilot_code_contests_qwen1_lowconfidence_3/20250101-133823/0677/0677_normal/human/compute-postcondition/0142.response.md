Postcondition: ***`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, and the current value of `u` is unvisited. If `not visited[u]` is `True`, then `pi[u]` is set to `v`, `visited[u]` is set to `True`, `determinate` is either `True` or `False` depending on the conditions, `stack` contains `u`, `distances1[u]` is set to `distances1[v] + 1`, and `distances2[u]` is set to `heights1[u]` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, otherwise `distances2[u]` remains unchanged if `determinate` is `False`. Since there is no else part, the state remains as described above if `not visited[u]` is `False`.***
