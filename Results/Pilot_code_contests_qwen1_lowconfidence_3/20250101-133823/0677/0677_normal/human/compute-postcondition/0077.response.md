The code assigns the value of `heights1[u]` to `distances2[u]`. Given the initial state:

- `len(stack)` is 2
- `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`
- `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one element
- `u` is a node that is now visited
- `pi[u]` is `v`
- `visited[u]` is `True`
- `determinate` is `True`
- `distances1[u]` is greater than `heights1[u] + 1`

After executing the line `distances2[u] = heights1[u]`, the value of `distances2[u]` is set to `heights1[u]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is 2, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one element, `u` is a node that is now visited, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `distances1[u]` is greater than `heights1[u] + 1`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`**
