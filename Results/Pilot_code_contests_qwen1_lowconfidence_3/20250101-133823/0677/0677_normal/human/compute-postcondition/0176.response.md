Output State: **`len(stack)` is 0, for every node `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`: `pi[u]` is the node from which `u` was visited, `visited[u]` is `True`, `distances1[u]` is the shortest distance from any `numbers_of_attacked_cities[i]` to city `u` considering the height constraints, and `distances2[u]` is the alternative shortest distance from any `numbers_of_attacked_cities[i]` to city `u` considering the height constraints.**
