`visited[u]` is set to `True`. The value of `len(adjacents_list[v])` remains greater than 0, and the condition that at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited still holds. The current value of `u` remains unvisited (`visited[u]` is now `True`), `pi[u]` remains set to `v`, and the states of `determinate`, `stack`, `distances1[u]`, and `distances2[u]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, the current value of `u` is visited (`visited[u]` is True), `pi[u]` is set to `v`, and the states of `determinate`, `stack`, `distances1[u]`, and `distances2[u]` remain as per the initial conditions.**
