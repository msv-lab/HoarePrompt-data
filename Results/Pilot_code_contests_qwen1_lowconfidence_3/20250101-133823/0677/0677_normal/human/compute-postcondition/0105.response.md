The code `determinate = False` assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `determinate`. This is the only change made to the variables. The other variables (`len(stack)`, `v`, `adjacents_list[v]`, `u`, `pi[u]`, and `visited[u]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is 3, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node, `u` is the next unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `False`.**
