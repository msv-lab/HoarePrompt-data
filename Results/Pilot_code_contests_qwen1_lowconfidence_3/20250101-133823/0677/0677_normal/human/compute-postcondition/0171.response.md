The code `distances1[u] = distances1[v] + 1` updates the value of `distances1[u]` to `distances1[v] + 1`. Given the initial conditions, we know that:

- `len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0.
- At least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited.
- The current value of `u` is visited (`visited[u]` is True).
- `pi[u]` is set to `v`.
- The states of `stack`, `distances1[u]`, `distances2[u]`, and `heights1[u]` remain as per the initial conditions.

After the execution of the code:

- The value of `distances1[u]` is updated to `distances1[v] + 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.

Therefore, the Output State is: `len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, the current value of `u` is visited (`visited[u]` is True), `pi[u]` is set to `v`, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, the states of `stack`, `distances2[u]`, and `heights1[u]` remain as per the initial conditions, and `determinate` remains unchanged if its value was determined before.

Output State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, the current value of `u` is visited (`visited[u]` is True), `pi[u]` is set to `v`, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, the states of `stack`, `distances2[u]`, and `heights1[u]` remain as per the initial conditions, and `determinate` remains unchanged if its value was determined before.**
