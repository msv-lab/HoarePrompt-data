`q` is a list that contains `u_next`. The code appends `u` to the list `q`, so `q` will now contain both `u_next` and `u`. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`, and `q` contains both `u_next` and `u`.**
