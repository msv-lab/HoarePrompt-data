Postcondition: **`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `distance[u]` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` is set to `distance[v] + 1`, `q` contains all elements except the first one (i.e., `len(q) >= 0`), `v` is the first element that was removed from `q`. For any `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`, the current value of `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`. The if condition is met with `distance[u] == -1` for some `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`**
