The code snippet `q.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the deque `q`. The value of `u` is not specified in the initial state, but it is known that `u` is an element from `adjacents_list[v]` and has not been processed yet.

The initial state includes:
- `s` is an integer such that \(1 \leq s \leq n\)
- `distance` is a list where the element at index `s-1` is `0` and all other elements are `-1` except `distance[u]` which is `0`
- `adjacents_list` is unchanged
- `q` is a deque containing the remaining elements (after removing `s`)
- `v` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q`
- `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element that hasn't been processed yet

After executing `q.append(u)`, the deque `q` now contains its previous elements plus the new element `u`.

Output State: **`s` is an integer such that \(1 \leq s \leq n\); `distance` is a list where the element at index `s-1` is `0` and all other elements are `-1` except `distance[u]` which is `0`; `adjacents_list` is unchanged; `q` is a deque containing the remaining elements (after removing `s`) plus `u`; `v` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q`; `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element that hasn't been processed yet**
