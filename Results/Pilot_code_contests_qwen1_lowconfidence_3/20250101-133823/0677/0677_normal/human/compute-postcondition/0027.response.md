According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `u` and the list `adjacents_list[v]`. At the end of the last iteration, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `distance[u]` is set to 0, and `q` contains `u`.

At the start of the current iteration, `u` is an element from `adjacents_list[v]`. For the loop to execute again, `adjacents_list[v]` must still contain at least one element (since it must contain at least one element to enter the loop), and `u` will be the next adjacent node.

Given that `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element to enter the loop, it means there is at least one more element in the list after the last iteration. Let's denote this next element as `u_next`. Therefore, the list `adjacents_list[v]` will still contain at least one element, and `u` will be set to `u_next`.

Additionally, `distance[u]` will be set to 0, and `q` will contain `u_next`.

State: **`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `distance[u]` is set to 0, and `q` contains `u_next`**
