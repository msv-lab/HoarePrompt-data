The code snippet assigns the value of `heights1[u]` to `distances2[u]`. Given that `u` is the next unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`, and assuming `heights1[u]` is a specific value (since it is not specified, we will denote it as `h_u`), `distances2[u]` will take this value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is 4, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node, `u` is the next unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`.**
