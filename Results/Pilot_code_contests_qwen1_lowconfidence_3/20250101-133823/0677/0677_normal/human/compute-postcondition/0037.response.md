`v` is assigned the value of the first element in `q` using `popleft()`. This removes the first element from `q`. The values of `adjacents_list[v]`, `distance[u]` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`, and `q` are unchanged. 

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` is empty, `distance[u]` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` is set to `distance[v] + 1`, `q` contains all elements except the first one (i.e., `len(q) >= 0`), `v` is the first element that was removed from `q`.**
