The line `determinate = False` assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `determinate`. This does not affect the values of `len(adjacents_list[v])`, the unvisited nodes in `adjacents_list[v]`, the value of `u`, `pi[u]`, or `visited[u]`.

Output State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, and the current value of `u` is unvisited; `pi[u]` is `v`; `visited[u]` is `True`; `determinate` is `False`**
