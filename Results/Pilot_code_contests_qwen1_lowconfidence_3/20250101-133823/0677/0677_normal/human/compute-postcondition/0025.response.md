`q.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `q`. The variable `adjacents_list[v]` and `distance[u]` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `distance[u]` is 0, and `q` contains at least the element `u`.

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `distance[u]` is 0, `q` contains `u`**
