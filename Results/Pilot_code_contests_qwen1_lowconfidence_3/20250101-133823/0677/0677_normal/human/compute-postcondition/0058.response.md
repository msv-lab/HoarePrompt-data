The code `distances2[u] = heights1[u]` assigns the value of `heights1[u]` to `distances2[u]`. This changes the value of `distances2[u]` but does not affect any other variables. The initial conditions for the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `numbers_of_attacked_cities` is a list of `m` distinct integers, `adjacents_list` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list of integers, `v` is equal to `numbers_of_attacked_cities[0]`, `pi[u]` is updated to `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, `determinate` remains `False`, `distances2[u]` is now equal to `heights1[u]`.**
