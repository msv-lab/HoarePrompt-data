The code snippet appends `u` to the list `q`. Based on the initial state, `u` is an element from `adjacents_list[v]`, which means `distance[u]` is set to `distance[v] + 1` for those where `distance[u]` was `-1`. The variable `q` loses its first element, and now includes `u` at the end. The variable `v` remains unchanged as it is only mentioned as the first element that was removed from `q`.

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `distance[u]` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` is set to `distance[v] + 1` for those where `distance[u]` was `-1`, `q` contains all elements except the first one and now includes `u`, `v` is the first element that was removed from `q`**.
