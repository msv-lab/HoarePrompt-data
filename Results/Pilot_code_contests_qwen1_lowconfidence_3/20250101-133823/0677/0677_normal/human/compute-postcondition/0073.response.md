The code updates `distances1[u]` to be the maximum of `heights1[u]` and `distances2[v] + 1`. Given the conditions:

- `heights1[u] + 1` equals `distances2[v]`
- `heights1[u] + 1` is greater than `distances2[v]`

We know that `heights1[u] + 1` is the value of `distances2[v]` and also that it is greater than `distances2[v]`, which implies this condition holds true.

So, `distances1[u]` will be set to `heights1[u] + 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state:
- `len(stack)` is 2
- `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`
- `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one element
- `u` is a node that is now visited
- `pi[u]` is `v`
- `visited[u]` is `True`
- `determinate` is `True`

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`len(stack)` is 2, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one element, `u` is a node that is now visited, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `distances1[u]` is `heights1[u] + 1`**
