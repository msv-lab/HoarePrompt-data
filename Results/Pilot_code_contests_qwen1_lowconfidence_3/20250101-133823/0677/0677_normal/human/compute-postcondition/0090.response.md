The code `stack.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the `stack`. The value of `u` is an unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is 3, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node, `u` is an unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`**
