The code `distances2[u] = heights1[u]` assigns the value of `heights1[u]` to `distances2[u]`. Given the initial conditions, `heights1[u]` is a specific value and `distances2[u]` now holds this value.

- `len(stack)` remains unchanged as the code does not affect the stack.
- `v` remains the value of the previously top element in `stack`.
- `adjacents_list[v]` still has at least one unvisited node.
- `u` remains an unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`.
- `pi[u]` remains `v`.
- `visited[u]` remains `True`.
- `determinate` remains `True`.
- `distances1[u]` remains `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is 3, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node, `u` is an unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `distances1[u]` is `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`**
