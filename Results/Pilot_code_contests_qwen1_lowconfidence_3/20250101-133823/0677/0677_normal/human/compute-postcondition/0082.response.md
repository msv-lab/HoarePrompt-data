The code updates the value of `distances1[u]` to `distances1[v] + 1`. Given the initial state, we know that `distances1[v]` is the distance from the starting point to node `v`, and adding 1 to this value gives the distance to node `u`.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is 2, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one element, `u` is a node that is now visited, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`.**
