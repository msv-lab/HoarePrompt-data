`pi[u]` is assigned the value `v`. This means that the parent of node `u` (`pi[u]`) is now set to `v`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, the current value of `u` is unvisited (`visited[u]` is False), `pi[u]` is set to `v`, and the states of `determinate`, `stack`, `distances1[u]`, and `distances2[u]` remain as per the initial conditions.**
