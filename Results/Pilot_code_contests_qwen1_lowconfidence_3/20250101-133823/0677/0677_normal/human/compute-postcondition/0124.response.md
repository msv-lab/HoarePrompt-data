The code `visited[u] = True` sets the value of `visited[u]` to `True`. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `visited[u]`, and the rest of the conditions remain valid.

Output State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, and the current value of `u` is unvisited; `pi[u]` is `v`; `visited[u]` is `True`**
