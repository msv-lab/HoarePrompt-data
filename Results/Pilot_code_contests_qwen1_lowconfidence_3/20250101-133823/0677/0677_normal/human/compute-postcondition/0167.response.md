The code updates `distances2[u]` to be equal to `heights1[u]`. This means that the previous value of `distances2[u]` is replaced by the value of `heights1[u]`.

Output State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, the current value of `u` is visited (`visited[u]` is True), `pi[u]` is set to `v`, `determinate` is True, the states of `stack`, `distances1[u]`, `distances2[u]`, and `heights1[u]` remain as per the initial conditions; `distances2[u]` is now equal to `heights1[u]`**
