The code `distances2[u] = heights1[u]` assigns the value of `heights1[u]` to `distances2[u]`. Given the initial conditions:

- `len(stack)` is 3
- `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`
- `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node
- `u` is an unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`
- `pi[u]` is `v`
- `visited[u]` is `True`
- `determinate` is `True`
- `distances1[u]` is `heights1[u] + 2`
- `distances2[u]` remains unchanged
- `heights1[u]` remains unchanged
- `distances2[v]` remains unchanged

After executing the line of code, `distances2[u]` is updated to be equal to `heights1[u]`. All other variables remain in their initial or unchanged states.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is 3, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node, `u` is an unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `True`; `distances1[u]` is `heights1[u] + 2`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`, and `distances2[v]` remains unchanged.**
