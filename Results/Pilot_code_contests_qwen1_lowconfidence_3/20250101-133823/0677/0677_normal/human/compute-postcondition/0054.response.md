The function `func_6` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ n, representing a city in Byteforces. The function returns a list named `distance` where the element at index `s-1` is 0 and all other elements are set to their shortest path distances from city `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_6` is to accept an integer `s` and return a list `distance` where the distance from city `s` to itself is 0, and the distances from city `s` to all other cities are their shortest path distances.
