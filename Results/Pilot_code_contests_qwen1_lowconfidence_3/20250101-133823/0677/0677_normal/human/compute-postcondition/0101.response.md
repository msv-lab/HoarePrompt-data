Postcondition: ***`len(stack)` is 3, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node, `u` is an unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`, `pi[u]` is `v`, and `visited[u]` is `True`. Additionally, if `not determinate`, the values of `distances1[u]` and `distances2[u]` are updated such that `distances1[u] = heights1[u] + 2` and `distances2[u] = heights1[u]`. Otherwise, `distances1[u]` and `distances2[u]` retain their previous values.***
