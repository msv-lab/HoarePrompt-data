`visited[u]` is assigned the value `True`. This means the node `u` has been marked as visited. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is 2, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node, `u` is an unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`**
