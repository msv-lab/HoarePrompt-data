The code updates the value of `distances1[u]` to be the maximum of `heights1[u]` and `distances2[v] + 1`. Given the initial conditions:

- `len(stack)` is 4,
- `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`,
- `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node,
- `u` is the next unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`,
- `pi[u]` is `v`,
- `visited[u]` is `True`,
- and `determinate` is `True`.

After executing the line `distances1[u] = max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`, the variable `distances1[u]` is updated with the calculated value.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is 4, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node, `u` is the next unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, and `distances1[u]` is `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`**.
