Postcondition: ***`len(stack)` is 3, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node, `u` is an unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `True`. If `not determinate`, then the value of `distances1[u]` is `heights1[u] + 2`, and `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`. Otherwise, the values of `distances1[u]` and `distances2[u]` remain unchanged as per the initial conditions or previous computations.***
