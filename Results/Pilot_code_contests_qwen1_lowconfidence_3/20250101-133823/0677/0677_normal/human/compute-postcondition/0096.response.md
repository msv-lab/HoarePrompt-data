Postcondition: ***`len(stack)` is 3, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node, `u` is an unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `True`. The value of `distances1[u]` is `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`, and `distances2[u]` is either `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])` or `heights1[u]` depending on whether `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]` or not.***
