Output State: **`len(stack)` is 0, for every node `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`: `pi[u]` is the node from which `u` was visited, `visited[u]` is `True`, `distances1[u]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to `u` considering the height constraints, and `distances2[u]` is the alternative shortest distance from the starting node to `u` considering the height constraints.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to visit adjacent nodes until all nodes connected to `v` have been visited. This means that once a node is visited, it will not be revisited.
- After the loop finishes executing, `stack` will be empty because all nodes adjacent to `v` have been processed.
- For each node `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`:
  - `pi[u]` will be set to the node `v` from which `u` was visited.
  - `visited[u]` will be `True` indicating that `u` has been visited.
  - `distances1[u]` will be the shortest distance from the starting node to `u` considering the height constraints.
  - `distances2[u]` will be the alternative shortest distance from the starting node to `u` considering the height constraints.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `len(adjacents_list[v])` is 0), then the values of the variables will remain as they were in the initial state:
- `len(stack)` will be 0.
- For every node `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`, the values of `pi[u]`, `visited[u]`, `distances1[u]`, and `distances2[u]` will remain as they were initially.
