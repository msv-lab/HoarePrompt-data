The code `distance[u] = distance[v] + 1` updates the value of `distance[u]` to be one more than the current value of `distance[v]`. Given that `distance[u]` was initially set to 0, and assuming `v` is a neighbor of `u_next` (since `q` contains `u_next`), the value of `distance[v]` is already known and must be at least 0. However, without the exact value of `distance[v]`, we can express the new value of `distance[u]` as `distance[v] + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is: `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `distance[u]` is now `distance[v] + 1`, and `q` contains `u_next`.

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`, and `q` contains `u_next`**
