Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the initial state step by step:

The `while` loop condition is `len(q) > 0`. This means the loop will continue as long as the deque `q` is not empty.

The initial state before the loop is:
- `s` is an integer such that \(1 \leq s \leq n\).
- `distance` is a list of \(n\) elements where the element at index `s-1` is `0` and all other elements are `-1`.
- `adjacents_list` is unchanged.
- `q` is a deque containing `s`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `q` must contain at least one element, which is `s` initially. The condition `len(q) > 0` is satisfied since `q` contains `s`.

Since `q` already contains `s` and is not empty, no adjustments to the state are necessary to ensure the loop executes at least once.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

State: **`s` is an integer such that \(1 \leq s \leq n\), `distance` is a list of \(n\) elements where the element at index `s-1` is `0` and all other elements are `-1`, `adjacents_list` is unchanged, `q` is a deque containing `s`**
