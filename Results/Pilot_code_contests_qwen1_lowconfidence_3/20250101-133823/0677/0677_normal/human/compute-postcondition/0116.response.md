Postcondition: ***`len(stack)` is 4, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node, `u` is the next unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`. If `not determinate`, then `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1` and `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`.***
