According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `adjacents_list[v]`. The loop will execute again as long as there are elements left in `adjacents_list[v]`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element.
- `distance[u]` is either `distance[v] + 1` if `distance[u]` was initially `-1`, and `q` contains both `u_next` and `u`.
- There is no change in `distance[u]` if `distance[u]` was not `-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element that has not yet been processed.

Since `u` is being iterated over from `adjacents_list[v]`, the loop will execute again if there are still unprocessed elements in `adjacents_list[v]`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `adjacents_list[v]` still contains at least one element, and the other states remain the same since they do not change within the loop.

State: **`adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, `distance[u]` is either `distance[v] + 1` if `distance[u]` was initially `-1`, and `q` contains both `u_next` and `u`. There is no change in `distance[u]` if `distance[u]` was not `-1`.**
