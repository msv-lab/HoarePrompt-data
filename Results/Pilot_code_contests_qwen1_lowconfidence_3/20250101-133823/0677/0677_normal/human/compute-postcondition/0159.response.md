Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0.
- At least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited.
- The current value of `u` is visited (`visited[u]` is True).
- If `not visited[u]` is `True`, then `pi[u]` is set to `v`, `determinate` is either `True` or `False` depending on the conditions, `stack` contains `u` and the previously existing elements.
- If `not determinate`, then `distances1[u]` is updated to `distances1[v] + 1` and `distances2[u]` is set to `heights1[u]`.
- The state remains as described above if `not visited[u]` is `False`.

### Loop Iteration Conditions:
- The loop iterates over each `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`.

### Key Points for Next Iteration:
- For the loop to continue, `u` must be an unvisited node in `adjacents_list[v]`.
- Since `u` is visited, it needs to change to an unvisited state for the loop to execute again.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Identify the Next `u`**: The next `u` should be an unvisited node in `adjacents_list[v]`.
2. **Adjust States**: Ensure `visited[u]` is `False` for the next iteration.
3. **Update Other Variables**: Depending on the conditions, update other relevant variables such as `pi[u]`, `determinate`, `stack`, `distances1[u]`, and `distances2[u]`.

### New State:
Given that we need `u` to be unvisited for the loop to continue, let's assume `u` is the first unvisited node in `adjacents_list[v]` (as per the initial condition).

- `len(adjacents_list[v])` remains greater than 0.
- Now, `u` must be unvisited, so `visited[u]` is `False`.
- `pi[u]` is set to `v`.
- `determinate` is either `True` or `False` depending on the conditions.
- `stack` now includes `u` along with the previously existing elements.
- If `not determinate`, then `distances1[u]` is updated to `distances1[v] + 1` and `distances2[u]` is set to `heights1[u]`.

### Final State:
State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, and the current value of `u` is unvisited (`visited[u]` is False). If `not visited[u]` is `True`, then `pi[u]` is set to `v`, `determinate` is either `True` or `False` depending on the conditions, `stack` contains `u` and the previously existing elements. If `not determinate`, then `distances1[u]` is updated to `distances1[v] + 1` and `distances2[u]` is set to `heights1[u]`**.
