The code `determinate = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `determinate`. None of the other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `determinate` being set to `False`.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is greater than 1, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one element, `u` is a node that is now visited, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`**
