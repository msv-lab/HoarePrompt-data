`s` is assigned the value of `0`, and `distance[s]` is set to `0`. The value of `distance[s]` is updated, but the value of `s` itself is not changed from its initial state since `s` was an integer such that `1 ≤ s ≤ n`. The value of `adjacents_list` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ n, `distance` is a list of n elements where the element at index `s-1` is `0` and all other elements are `-1`, `adjacents_list` is unchanged.**
