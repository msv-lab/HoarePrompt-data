Postcondition: ***`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element for which `distance[u]` is `-1`. For all such elements `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`, `distance[u]` is set to `distance[v] + 1`. `q` now contains all elements except the first one and now includes `u`. `v` is the first element that was removed from `q`.***
