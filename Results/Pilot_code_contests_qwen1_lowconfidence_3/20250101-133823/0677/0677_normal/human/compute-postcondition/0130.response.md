The code updates the value of `distances1[u]` to be the maximum of `heights1[u]` and `distances2[v] + 1`. Given the initial conditions, `heights1[u] + 1` equals `distances1[v]` and `heights1[u] + 1` is greater than `distances2[v]`. This means:

- `distances1[u]` is updated to be the maximum of `heights1[u]` and `distances2[v] + 1`.
- Since `heights1[u] + 1` is greater than `distances2[v]`, `distances1[u]` will be set to `heights1[u]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, and the current value of `u` is unvisited; `pi[u]` is `v`; `visited[u]` is `True`; `determinate` is `True`; `stack` contains `u`; `heights1[u] + 1` equals `distances1[v]`; `heights1[u]` equals `distances1[u]; `heights1[u] + 1` is greater than `distances2[v]`**.
