The code `stack.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the stack. Since `u` is already visited (`visited[u]` is True) and is part of the adjacency list of `v`, the only change is in the `stack` variable, which now includes `u`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, the current value of `u` is visited (`visited[u]` is True), `pi[u]` is set to `v`, and `determinate` is False, and the states of `stack`, `distances1[u]`, and `distances2[u]` remain as per the initial conditions; `stack` now includes `u`.**
