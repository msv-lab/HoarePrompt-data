The code assigns the value of `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)` to `distances1[u]`. Given the initial conditions, `distances2[v]` is a specific value since `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, and `heights1[u]` is a specific value for the node `u`.

The Output State is:

**`len(stack)` is 3, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node, `u` is an unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `distances1[u]` is `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`**
