The code sets `determinate` to `True`. This changes the value of `determinate` from `False` to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is 2, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one element, `u` is a node that is now visited, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `heights1[u] + 1` equals `distances1[v]`, and `heights1[u] + 1` is greater than `distances2[v]`.**
