Postcondition: ***`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, and the current value of `u` is unvisited; `pi[u]` is `v`; `visited[u]` is `True`; `determinate` is `True`; `stack` contains `u`; `heights1[u] + 1` equals `distances1[v]`; `heights1[u]` equals `distances1[u]; `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]` and `distances2[u]` equals `distances2[v] + 1` if `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]`, otherwise `distances2[u]` equals `heights1[u]`.***
