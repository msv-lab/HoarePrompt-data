You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of cities in Byteforces, m is an integer representing the number of cities being attacked, numbers_of_attacked_cities is a list of m distinct integers representing the cities being attacked, and adjacents_list is a list of length n where each element is a list of integers representing the adjacent cities for the corresponding city index. Additionally, pi, heights1, distances1, and distances2 are pre-defined variables used within the program, and num_of_attacked_cities is a list containing the indices of the cities being attacked.
def func_5():
    visited = [(False) for x in range(n)]
    visited[numbers_of_attacked_cities[0]] = True
    stack = []
    stack.append(numbers_of_attacked_cities[0])
    func_4(numbers_of_attacked_cities[0])
    while len(stack) > 0:
        v = stack.pop()
        
        for u in adjacents_list[v]:
            if not visited[u]:
                pi[u] = v
                visited[u] = True
                determinate = False
                stack.append(u)
                if heights1[u] + 1 == distances1[v]:
                    if heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]:
                        determinate = True
                        distances1[u] = max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)
                        if distances1[u] == heights1[u]:
                            distances2[u] = max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])
                        else:
                            distances2[u] = heights1[u]
                if not determinate:
                    distances1[u] = distances1[v] + 1
                    distances2[u] = heights1[u]
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `len(stack)` is 0, for every node `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`: `pi[u]` is the node from which `u` was visited, `visited[u]` is `True`, `distances1[u]` is the shortest distance from any `numbers_of_attacked_cities[i]` to city `u` considering the height constraints, and `distances2[u]` is the alternative shortest distance from any `numbers_of_attacked_cities[i]` to city `u` considering the height constraints.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `numbers_of_attacked_cities`, `adjacents_list`, `pi`, `heights1`, `distances1`, `distances2`, and `num_of_attacked_cities`.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
