The code `stack.append(u)` appends the node `u` to the stack. Based on the initial state, the length of `stack` was greater than 1, `v` was the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` had at least one element, `u` is a node that is now visited, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `False`. After appending `u` to the stack, the length of `stack` increases by 1.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is 2 (since it was greater than 1 and we added 1 more), `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one element, `u` is a node that is now visited, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`**
