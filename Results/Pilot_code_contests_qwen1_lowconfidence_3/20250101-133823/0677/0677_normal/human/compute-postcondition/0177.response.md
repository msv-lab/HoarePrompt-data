The function `func_5` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: An integer representing the number of cities in Byteforces.
- `m`: An integer representing the number of cities being attacked.
- `numbers_of_attacked_cities`: A list of `m` distinct integers representing the cities being attacked.
- `adjacents_list`: A list of length `n` where each element is a list of integers representing the adjacent cities for the corresponding city index.
- `pi`, `heights1`, `distances1`, `distances2`: Pre-defined variables used within the program.
- `num_of_attacked_cities`: A list containing the indices of the cities being attacked.

The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided information, but it likely performs some operations based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `numbers_of_attacked_cities`, `adjacents_list`, `pi`, `heights1`, `distances1`, `distances2`, and `num_of_attacked_cities`.**
