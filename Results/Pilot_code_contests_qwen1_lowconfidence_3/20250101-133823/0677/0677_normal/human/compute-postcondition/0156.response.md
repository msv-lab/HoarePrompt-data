Output State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, the current value of `u` is visited (`visited[u]` is True), `pi[u]` is set to `v`, `determinate` is either `True` or `False` depending on the condition, `stack` contains `u` and the previously existing elements, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`**
