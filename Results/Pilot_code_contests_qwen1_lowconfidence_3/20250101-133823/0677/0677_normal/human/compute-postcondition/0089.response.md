The code `determinate = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `determinate`. This does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that `determinate` is now `False`.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is 2, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node, `u` is an unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`**
