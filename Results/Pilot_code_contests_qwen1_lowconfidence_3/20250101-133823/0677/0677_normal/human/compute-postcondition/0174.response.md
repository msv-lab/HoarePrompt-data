Postcondition: ***`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, and the current value of `u` is unvisited (`visited[u]` is False). If `not visited[u]` is `True`, then `pi[u]` is set to `v`, and the states of `stack`, `distances1[u]`, `distances2[u]`, `heights1[u]`, and `determinate` are updated as follows: if `not determinate`, then `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`, and `determinate` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the states remain as per the initial conditions. Since there is no else part, these conditions hold true regardless of the outcome of the if condition.***
