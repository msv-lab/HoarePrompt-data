Let's break down the given information and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
1. `s` is an integer such that \(1 \leq s \leq n\).
2. `distance` is a list of \(n\) elements where the element at index `s-1` is `0` and all other elements are `-1`.
3. `adjacents_list` is unchanged.
4. `q` is a deque containing the remaining elements (after removing `s`).
5. `v` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q`.

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `adjacents_list[v]`.
- For the loop to execute, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element. This ensures there is at least one adjacent element to iterate over.

### Steps:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `s` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq s \leq n\).
   - `distance` has an element at index `s-1` set to `0`, and all other elements are `-1`.
   - `q` is a deque containing the remaining elements after removing `s`.
   - `v` is the value of the element at the front of `q`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element.

### Adjusted States:
- Since the loop depends on `adjacents_list[v]` having at least one element, we need to ensure this condition is met.

### Final Answer:
State: **`s` is an integer such that \(1 \leq s \leq n\), `distance` is a list of \(n\) elements where the element at index `s-1` is `0` and all other elements are `-1`, `adjacents_list` is unchanged, `q` is a deque containing the remaining elements (after removing `s`), `v` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q`, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element**
