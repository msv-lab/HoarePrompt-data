The code updates `distances2[u]` to the maximum of `distances2[v] + 1` and `heights2[u]`. Given the initial state:

- `len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0
- At least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited
- `visited[u]` is True
- `pi[u]` is set to `v`
- `determinate` is `True`
- `stack` contains `u` and the previously existing elements
- `distances1[u]` is set to `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`
- `distances2[u]` is set to `heights1[u]` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, otherwise `distances2[u]` remains unchanged.

Let's consider the updated value of `distances2[u]`:

- If `distances2[v] + 1 > heights2[u]`, then `distances2[u]` remains unchanged from its previous value, which was set to `heights1[u]` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`.
- If `distances2[v] + 1 <= heights2[u]`, then `distances2[u]` is updated to `distances2[v] + 1`.

Since `distances2[u]` was initially set to `heights1[u]` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, the new value of `distances2[u]` depends on the comparison between `distances2[v] + 1` and `heights2[u]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, the current value of `u` is visited (`visited[u]` is True), `pi[u]` is set to `v`, `determinate` is `True`, `stack` contains `u` and the previously existing elements, `distances1[u]` is set to `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`, `distances2[u]` is updated to `distances2[v] + 1` if `distances2[v] + 1 > heights2[u]`, otherwise `distances2[u]` remains `heights1[u]` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`**.
