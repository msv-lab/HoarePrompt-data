The code `pi[u] = v` assigns the value of `v` to `pi[u]`. Given the initial conditions, the value of `pi[u]` changes to `v`, while all other conditions remain the same.

Output State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, the current value of `u` is visited (`visited[u]` is True), `pi[u]` is set to `v`, `determinate` is either `True` or `False` depending on the conditions, `stack` contains `u`, `distances1[u]` is set to `distances1[v] + 1`, and `distances2[u]` is set to `heights1[u]` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, otherwise `distances2[u]` remains unchanged if `determinate` is `False`.**
