`visited[u]` is assigned the value `True`, indicating that node `u` has been visited. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `len(stack)` is greater than 1, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one element, `u` is a node that is not visited (now visited), `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`.
