Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `numbers_of_attacked_cities` is a list of `m` distinct integers, `adjacents_list` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list of integers, `v` is equal to `numbers_of_attacked_cities[0]`, `pi[u]` is updated to `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` remains `False`. If `heights1[u] + 1 == distances1[v]`, then `distances1[v]` is updated to `max(heights1[v], distances2[v] + 1)` and `distances2[u]` is updated to `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])`. Otherwise, `distances1[v]` is updated to `max(heights1[v], distances2[v] + 1)` and `distances2[u]` is equal to `heights1[u]`. All other variables remain unchanged.**
