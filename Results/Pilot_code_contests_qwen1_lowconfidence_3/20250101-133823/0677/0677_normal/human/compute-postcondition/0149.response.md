The code updates the value of `distances1[u]` to the maximum of `heights1[u]` and `distances2[v] + 1`. Given the initial conditions, let's break down the impact:

1. `len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0.
2. At least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited.
3. The current value of `u` is visited (`visited[u]` is True).
4. `pi[u]` is set to `v`.
5. `determinate` is `True`.
6. `stack` contains `u` and the previously existing elements.
7. `distances1[u]` is set to `distances1[v] + 1`.
8. `distances2[u]` is set to `heights1[u]` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, otherwise `distances2[u]` remains unchanged.

Given these conditions, the updated value of `distances1[u]` will be:

\[ \text{distances1[u]} = \max(\text{heights1[u]}, \text{distances2[v]} + 1) \]

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, the current value of `u` is visited (`visited[u]` is True), `pi[u]` is set to `v`, `determinate` is `True`, `stack` contains `u` and the previously existing elements, `distances1[u]` is set to `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`, and `distances2[u]` is set to `heights1[u]` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, otherwise `distances2[u]` remains unchanged.**
