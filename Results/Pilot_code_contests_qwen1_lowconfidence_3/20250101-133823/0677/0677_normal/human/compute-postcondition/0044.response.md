The code `distance[u] = distance[v] + 1` updates the value of `distance[u]` to be `distance[v] + 1`. For the elements `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` where `distance[u]` was `-1`, this condition will be satisfied. The value of `distance[u]` for these elements is now updated. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element for which `distance[u]` is `-1`, `distance[u]` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` is set to `distance[v] + 1` for those where `distance[u]` was `-1`, `q` contains all elements except the first one and now includes `u`, `v` is the first element that was removed from `q`, `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` where `distance[u]` was `-1`.**
