`v` is assigned the value of the element at the front of `q`, which is obtained by calling `q.popleft()`. This operation removes the first element from the deque `q` and assigns it to `v`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is an integer such that \(1 \leq s \leq n\), `distance` is a list of \(n\) elements where the element at index `s-1` is `0` and all other elements are `-1`, `adjacents_list` is unchanged, `q` is a deque containing the remaining elements (after removing `s`), `v` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q`**
