According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the queue `q`. If the length of `q` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows:

- `adjacents_list[v]` is empty
- `distance[u]` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` is set to `distance[v] + 1`
- `q` contains all nodes that are at a distance of `distance[v] + 1` from `s`

For the loop to be executed one more time, the length of `q` must be greater than 0. Since `q` contains nodes at a distance of `distance[v] + 1` from `s`, we don't need to adjust any other states.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `len(q) > 0`.

State: **`adjacents_list[v]` is empty, `distance[u]` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` is set to `distance[v] + 1`, and `q` must contain at least one node (i.e., `len(q) > 0`)**
