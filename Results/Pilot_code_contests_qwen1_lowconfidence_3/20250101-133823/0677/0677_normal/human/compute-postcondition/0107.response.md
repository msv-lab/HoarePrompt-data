The variable `determinate` is assigned the value `True`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `len(stack)` is 4, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node, `u` is the next unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `True`.
