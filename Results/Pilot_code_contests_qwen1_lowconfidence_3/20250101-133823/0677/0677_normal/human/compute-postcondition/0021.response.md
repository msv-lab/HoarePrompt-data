`v` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `q` using the `popleft()` method, which removes and returns the leftmost element of the queue `q`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`s` is an integer such that \(1 \leq s \leq n\); `distance` is a list where the element at index `s-1` is `0` and all other elements are set according to the shortest path distances from `s`; `adjacents_list` is unchanged; `q` does not contain the element that was removed (now stored in `v`); `v` is the value of the first element that was removed from `q`; `adjacents_list[v]` is empty or contains no elements that haven't been processed.**
