Output State: **`s` is an integer such that \(1 \leq s \leq n\); `distance` is a list where the element at index `s-1` is `0` and all other elements are set according to the shortest path distances from `s`; `adjacents_list` is unchanged; `q` is an empty deque; `v` is the value of the last element that was processed; `adjacents_list[v]` is empty or contains no elements that haven't been processed.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to process adjacent nodes until there are no more unprocessed adjacent nodes.
- Initially, only the starting node `s` has a distance of `0`, and all other nodes have a distance of `-1`.
- During each iteration, the loop processes nodes that have not yet been assigned a shortest path distance.
- Each time an adjacent node `u` is processed, its distance is updated to `distance[v] + 1`.
- The node `u` is added to the deque `q` for further processing.
- The loop continues to execute until there are no more nodes to process, meaning `q` becomes empty and all nodes in `distance` have been updated to their shortest path distances from `s`.

Since the loop stops when all nodes are processed, the final state will be where `q` is empty, and all nodes in `distance` are updated correctly.
