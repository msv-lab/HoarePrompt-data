`distances2[u]` is assigned the value of `heights1[u]`. The value of `u` is a node that is now visited, and `heights1[u]` is a specific value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `len(stack)` is 2, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one element, `u` is a node that is now visited, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is 2, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one element, `u` is a node that is now visited, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`**
