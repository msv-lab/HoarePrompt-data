Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` is empty, `distance[u]` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` is set to `distance[v] + 1`, and `q` contains all nodes that are at a distance of `distance[v] + 1` from `s`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `distance[s-1]` is `0`, and `distance[u]` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` is either `-1` or `distance[v] + 1`.
- The loop continues to run as long as there are unprocessed nodes in `adjacents_list[v]`.
- Each time the loop runs, it processes each adjacent node `u` of `v` and updates its distance to `distance[v] + 1` if it was previously unprocessed (`distance[u] == -1`).
- The node `u` is added to the queue `q` for further processing.
- Once all nodes directly connected to `v` are processed, the process repeats until there are no more nodes left to process.
- When `adjacents_list[v]` becomes empty, it means all reachable nodes from `s` have been processed, and their distances have been correctly set.
- Therefore, after the loop completes, `q` will contain all nodes that are exactly `distance[v] + 1` away from `s`, and `adjacents_list[v]` will be empty. All relevant `distance[u]` values will be correctly set to the shortest path distance from `s`.
