The code updates `distances2[u]` to the maximum of `distances2[v] + 1` and `heights2[u]`. Given that `distances2[v]` is a value from the initial state and `heights2[u]` is also a value from the initial state, we can directly compute the new value of `distances2[u]`.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `distances2[v]` and `heights2[u]`, we keep them as their general forms.

Output State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, the current value of `u` is visited (`visited[u]` is True), `pi[u]` is set to `v`, `determinate` is True, and the states of `stack`, `distances1[u]`, `distances2[u]`, and `heights1[u]` remain as per the initial conditions; `distances2[u]` is updated to `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])**
