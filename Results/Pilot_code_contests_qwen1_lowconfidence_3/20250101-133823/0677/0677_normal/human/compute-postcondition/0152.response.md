Postcondition: ***`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, the current value of `u` is visited (`visited[u]` is True), `pi[u]` is set to `v`, `determinate` is `True`, `stack` contains `u` and the previously existing elements, `distances1[u]` is set to `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`, and `distances2[u]` is updated as follows: if `distances1[u] == heights1[u]`, then `distances2[u]` is updated to `distances2[v] + 1` if `distances2[v] + 1 > heights2[u]`, otherwise `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`; if `distances1[u] != heights1[u]`, then `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`.***
