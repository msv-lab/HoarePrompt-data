The code assigns the value of `v` to `pi[u]`. The variable `v` represents the value of the previously top element in `stack`, and `u` is a node that is not visited. After executing the line `pi[u] = v`, the value of `pi[u]` is updated to `v`.

The output state is:

Output State: **`len(stack)` is greater than 1, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one element, `u` is a node that is not visited, `pi[u]` is `v`**
