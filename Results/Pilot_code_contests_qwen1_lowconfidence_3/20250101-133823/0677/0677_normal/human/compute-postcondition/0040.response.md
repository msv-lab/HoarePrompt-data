The code snippet sets the value of `distance[u]` to `distance[v] + 1` for each `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` where `distance[u]` was previously `-1`. This means that for any `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`, if `distance[u]` was `-1`, it is now updated to `distance[v] + 1`. The other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `distance[u]` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` is set to `distance[v] + 1` for those where `distance[u]` was `-1`, `q` contains all elements except the first one (i.e., `len(q) >= 0`), `v` is the first element that was removed from `q`.**
