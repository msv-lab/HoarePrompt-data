The code `distances1[u] = distances1[v] + 1` updates the value of `distances1[u]` to be `distances1[v] + 1`. According to the precondition, `distances1[v]` is equal to `heights1[u] + 1` because `heights1[u] + 1 == distances1[v]`. Therefore, the new value of `distances1[u]` is `heights1[u] + 1 + 1 = heights1[u] + 2`.

The other variables are not affected by this line of code. So, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the updated value of `distances1[u]`.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is 3, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node, `u` is an unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `True`; `distances1[u]` is `heights1[u] + 2`, and the values of `distances2[u]`, `heights1[u]`, and `distances2[v]` remain unchanged.**
