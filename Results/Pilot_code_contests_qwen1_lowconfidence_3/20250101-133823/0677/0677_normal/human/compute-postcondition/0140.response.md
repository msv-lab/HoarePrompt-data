The code sets `distances2[u]` to `heights1[u]`. Given the initial conditions:

- `len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0
- At least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited
- The current value of `u` is unvisited
- `pi[u]` is `v`
- `visited[u]` is `True`
- `determinate` is `False`
- `stack` contains `u`
- `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`
- If `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, then `heights1[u]` equals `distances1[u]` and `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]`, and `distances2[u]` equals `distances2[v] + 1` if `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]`, otherwise `distances2[u]` equals `heights1[u]`; otherwise, the values of `determinate`, `heights1[u]`, `distances1[u]`, and `distances2[u]` remain unchanged.

After setting `distances2[u]` to `heights1[u]`, the updated state is:

- `len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0
- At least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited
- The current value of `u` is unvisited
- `pi[u]` is `v`
- `visited[u]` is `True`
- `determinate` is `False`
- `stack` contains `u`
- `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`
- `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`

Output State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0; at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited; the current value of `u` is unvisited; `pi[u]` is `v`; `visited[u]` is `True`; `determinate` is `False`; `stack` contains `u`; `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`; `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`**
