The code `visited[u] = True` changes the value of the `visited[u]` variable from `True` to `True`. This means that the value of `visited[u]` remains `True`, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is 3, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node, `u` is the next unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`, `pi[u]` is `v`, and `visited[u]` is `True`.**
