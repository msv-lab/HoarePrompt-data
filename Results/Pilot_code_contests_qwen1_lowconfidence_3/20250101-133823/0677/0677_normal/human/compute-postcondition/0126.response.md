`u` is appended to the stack. The length of `adjacents_list[v]` remains greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is still unvisited, the current value of `u` remains unvisited, `pi[u]` remains `v`, `visited[u]` remains `True`, and `determinate` remains `False`. 

Output State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, and the current value of `u` is unvisited; `pi[u]` is `v`; `visited[u]` is `True`; `determinate` is `False`; `stack` contains `u`**
