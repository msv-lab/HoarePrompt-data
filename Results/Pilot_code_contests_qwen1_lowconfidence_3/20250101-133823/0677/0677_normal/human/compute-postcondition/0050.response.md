Postcondition: **`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element for which `distance[u]` is `-1`. For all such elements `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`, `distance[u]` is set to `distance[v] + 1`. `q` now contains at least one element `u` for which `distance[u]` is `-1`, and the first element of `q` is not `v`. If `distance[u]` is `-1`, then `distance[u]` is updated to `distance[v] + 1`.**
