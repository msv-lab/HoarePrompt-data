The code sets `distances2[u]` to `heights1[u]`. Previously, `distances2[u]` was set to `heights1[u]` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, otherwise it remained unchanged. Now, regardless of the condition, `distances2[u]` is explicitly set to `heights1[u]`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, the current value of `u` is visited (`visited[u]` is True), `pi[u]` is set to `v`, `determinate` is `True`, `stack` contains `u` and the previously existing elements, `distances1[u]` is set to `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`, and `distances2[u]` is now `heights1[u]`.**
