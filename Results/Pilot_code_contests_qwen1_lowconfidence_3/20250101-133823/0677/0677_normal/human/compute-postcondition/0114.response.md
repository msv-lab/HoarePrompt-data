The code `distances1[u] = distances1[v] + 1` updates the value of `distances1[u]` to be the value of `distances1[v]` plus 1. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `len(stack)` is 4
- `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`
- `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node
- `u` is the next unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`
- `pi[u]` is `v`
- `visited[u]` is `True`
- If `heights1[u] + 1 == distances1[v]`, then `determinate` is `True` and `distances2[u]` is either `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])` or `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)` depending on whether `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]` or not. Otherwise, `determinate` remains `False`.

After executing the line of code, the value of `distances1[u]` is updated, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is 4, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node, `u` is the next unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, and the condition for `determinate` remains as described.**
