The code updates `distances2[u]` to `heights1[u]`. Given the initial conditions:

- `len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0
- At least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited
- The current value of `u` is unvisited
- `pi[u]` is `v`
- `visited[u]` is `True`
- `determinate` is `True`
- `stack` contains `u`
- `heights1[u] + 1` equals `distances1[v]`
- `heights1[u]` equals `distances1[u]`
- `heights1[u] + 1` is less than or equal to `distances2[v]`

After the code executes:

- `distances2[u]` is updated to `heights1[u]`

The output state is:

Output State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, and the current value of `u` is unvisited; `pi[u]` is `v`; `visited[u]` is `True`; `determinate` is `True`; `stack` contains `u`; `heights1[u] + 1` equals `distances1[v]`; `heights1[u]` equals `distances1[u]`; `heights1[u] + 1` is less than or equal to `distances2[v]`; `distances2[u]` equals `heights1[u]`**
