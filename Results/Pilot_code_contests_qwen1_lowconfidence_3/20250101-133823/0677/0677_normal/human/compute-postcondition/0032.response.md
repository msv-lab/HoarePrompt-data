The code updates the value of `distance[u]` to `distance[v] + 1`, where `distance[v]` was previously either `-1` or some other value. Since `distance[u]` was initially `-1`, it is now set to `distance[v] + 1`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, `distance[u]` is now `distance[v] + 1`, and `q` contains both `u_next` and `u`.**
