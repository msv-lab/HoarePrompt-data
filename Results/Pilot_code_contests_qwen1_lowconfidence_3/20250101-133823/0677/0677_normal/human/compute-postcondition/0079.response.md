Postcondition: ***`len(stack)` is 2, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one element, `u` is a node that is now visited, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`. If `distances1[u]` is equal to `heights1[u]`, then `distances2[u]` is `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])`. If `distances1[u]` is greater than `heights1[u] + 1`, then `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`. Otherwise, `distances2[u]` remains unchanged.***
