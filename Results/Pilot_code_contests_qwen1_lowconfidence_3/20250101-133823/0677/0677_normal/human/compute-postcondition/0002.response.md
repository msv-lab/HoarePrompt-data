The code initializes a deque object named `q`. A deque (double-ended queue) is a list-like container that allows appending and popping elements from both ends. However, the initial state of `q` is empty since no elements are added to it in this snippet.

The values of `s`, `distance`, and `adjacents_list` remain unchanged as the code snippet does not modify these variables.

Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ n, `distance` is a list of n elements where the element at index `s-1` is `0` and all other elements are `-1`, `adjacents_list` is unchanged, `q` is an empty deque.**
