The code initializes a list called `distance` with `-1` for each index ranging from `0` to `n-1`. This means that each element in the `distance` list is set to `-1`. The variable `s` remains unchanged, and the `adjacents_list` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ n, `distance` is a list of n elements where each element is -1, `adjacents_list` is unchanged.**
