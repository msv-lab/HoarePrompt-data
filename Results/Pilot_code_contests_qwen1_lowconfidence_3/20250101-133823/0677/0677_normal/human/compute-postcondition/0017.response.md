The code `q.append(u)` appends the value `u` to the deque `q`. This operation does not affect any other variables. 

Output State: **`s` is an integer such that \(1 \leq s \leq n\); `distance` is a list where the element at index `u-1` is now `distance[v] + 1` and all other elements are `-1` unless `distance[u]` was `-1`, in which case it is updated to `0`; `adjacents_list` is unchanged; `q` is a deque containing the remaining elements (after removing `s`) plus `u`; `v` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q`; `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element that hasn't been processed yet.**
