Postcondition: ***`len(stack)` is 2, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one element, `u` is a node that is now visited, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`. If `not visited[u]` is `False`, then:
- If `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]`, `distances2[u]` is updated to `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])`.
- If `distances1[u]` is greater than `heights1[u] + 1`, `distances2[u]` is updated to `heights1[u]`.
- Otherwise, `distances2[u]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `distances2[u]` is set to `heights1[u]`.***
