The code snippet appends `u` to the list `q`. The previous value of `q` contained both `u_next` and `u`, so after appending `u` to `q`, `q` will contain `u_next`, `u`, and `u` again.

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, `distance[u]` is now `distance[v] + 1`, and `q` contains `u_next`, `u`, `u`.**
