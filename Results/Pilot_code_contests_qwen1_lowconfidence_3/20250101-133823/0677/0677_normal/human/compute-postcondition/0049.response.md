`q` is a queue or list where `u` is appended to the end of it. The value of `u` is determined by the condition that for all elements `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`, `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`. The first element of `q` was not `v` before the append operation, and now it includes `u`. The variable `adjacents_list[v]` remains unchanged, and `distance[u]` is set to `distance[v] + 1`.

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element for which `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`; `q` now contains all its previous elements and `u`; `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`.**
