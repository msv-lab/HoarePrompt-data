The code updates the value of `distances1[u]` to be the maximum of `heights1[u]` and `distances2[v] + 1`. Given the initial conditions:

- `len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0
- At least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited
- The current value of `u` is visited (`visited[u]` is True)
- `pi[u]` is set to `v`
- `determinate` is True
- The states of `stack`, `distances1[u]`, and `distances2[u]` remain as per the initial conditions
- `stack` now includes `u`

After executing the line:
```python
distances1[u] = max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)
```

The variable `distances1[u]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `distances2[v] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.

Output State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, the current value of `u` is visited (`visited[u]` is True), `pi[u]` is set to `v`, `determinate` is True, and the states of `stack`, `distances1[u]`, `distances2[u]`, and `heights1[u]` remain as per the initial conditions; `distances1[u]` is updated to the maximum of `heights1[u]` and `distances2[v] + 1**, `stack` now includes `u`.
