The code snippet `distance[u] = distance[v] + 1` updates the value of `distance[u]` to be `distance[v] + 1`. This means that for all elements `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` for which `distance[u]` was initially `-1`, the distance is now updated.

Given the initial state:
- `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element for which `distance[u]` is `-1`.
- For all such elements `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`, `distance[u]` is set to `distance[v] + 1`.
- `q` now contains all elements except the first one and now includes `u`.
- `v` is the first element that was removed from `q`.

After executing the code `distance[u] = distance[v] + 1`:
- The value of `distance[u]` for each `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` for which `distance[u]` was `-1` is now updated to `distance[v] + 1`.

The state of `adjacents_list[v]` and `q` remains unchanged in terms of their structure, but the values within `distance` have been updated.

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element for which `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`. For all such elements `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`, `distance[u]` is set to `distance[v] + 1`. `q` now contains all elements except the first one and now includes `u`, and the first element of `q` is not `v`.**
