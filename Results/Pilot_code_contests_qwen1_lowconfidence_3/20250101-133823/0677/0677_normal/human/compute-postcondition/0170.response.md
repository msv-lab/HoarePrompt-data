Postcondition: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, the current value of `u` is visited (`visited[u]` is True), `pi[u]` is set to `v`, and the states of `stack`, `distances1[u]`, `distances2[u]`, and `heights1[u]` remain as per the initial conditions. If `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, then `determinate` is set to True. If `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]`, then `distances2[u]` is updated to `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])`. Otherwise, `distances2[u]` is updated to `heights1[u]`.**
