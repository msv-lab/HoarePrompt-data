`distances2[u]` is assigned the value of `heights1[u]`. Given the initial conditions, the value of `distances2[u]` will now be equal to `heights1[u]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, the current value of `u` is visited (`visited[u]` is True), `pi[u]` is set to `v`, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`, the states of `stack`, `heights1[u]`, and `determinate` remain as per the initial conditions.**
