The code `q.append(u)` appends the value `u` to the deque `q`. The value of `u` is the adjacent node of the node previously at the front of `q`, which is `v`. Since `v` was at the front of `q`, `u` must be an element in `adjacents_list[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state includes `q` having an additional element `u` appended to it, while the other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`s` is an integer such that \(1 \leq s \leq n\); `distance` is a list where the element at index `s-1` is `0` and all other elements are `-1`; `adjacents_list` is unchanged; `q` is a deque containing the remaining elements (after removing `s`) with an additional element `u` appended to it; `v` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q`; `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element; `distance[u]` is `0`.**
