Postcondition: ***`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0; at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited; the current value of `u` is unvisited; `pi[u]` is `v`; `visited[u]` is `True`; `determinate` is either `True` or `False` depending on the conditions; `stack` contains `u`; `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`; `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, otherwise `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]` remains unchanged if `determinate` is `False`.***
