Postcondition: ***`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `distance[u]` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` is set to `distance[v] + 1` for those where `distance[u]` was `-1`, `q` contains all elements except the first one and now includes `u`, `v` is the first element that was removed from `q`. If `distance[u]` equals `-1`, `distance[u]` is updated to `distance[v] + 1`, and `u` is added to `q`. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
