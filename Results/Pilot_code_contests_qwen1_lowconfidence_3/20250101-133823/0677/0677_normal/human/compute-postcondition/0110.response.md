The code snippet assigns the value of `heights1[u]` to `distances2[u]`. Given the initial state, `distances2[u]` was previously equal to `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`. Now, it will be updated to `heights1[u]`.

- `len(stack)` remains 4.
- `v` remains the value of the previously top element in `stack`.
- `adjacents_list[v]` still has at least one unvisited node.
- `u` remains the next unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`.
- `pi[u]` remains `v`.
- `visited[u]` remains `True`.
- `determinate` remains `True`.
- `distances2[u]` is now `heights1[u]`.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is 4, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node, `u` is the next unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, and `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`.**
