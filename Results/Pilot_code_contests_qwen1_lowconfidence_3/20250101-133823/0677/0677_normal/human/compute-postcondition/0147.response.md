The code snippet `stack.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the `stack`. This operation does not affect the values of other variables, except for updating the `stack` to include the new value of `u`.

Output State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, the current value of `u` is visited (`visited[u]` is True), `pi[u]` is set to `v`, `determinate` is `False`, `stack` contains `u` and the previously existing elements, `distances1[u]` is set to `distances1[v] + 1`, and `distances2[u]` is set to `heights1[u]` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, otherwise `distances2[u]` remains unchanged.**
