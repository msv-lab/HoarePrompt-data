The variable `determinate` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, the current value of `u` is visited (`visited[u]` is True), `pi[u]` is set to `v`, and `determinate` is False, and the states of `stack`, `distances1[u]`, and `distances2[u]` remain as per the initial conditions.**
