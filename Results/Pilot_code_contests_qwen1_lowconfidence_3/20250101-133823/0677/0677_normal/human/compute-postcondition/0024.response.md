`distance[u]` is assigned the value `distance[v] + 1`. The value of `distance[v]` is -1 according to the initial state, so `distance[u]` becomes -1 + 1, which is 0. The precondition that `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element remains unchanged.

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `distance[u]` is 0.**
