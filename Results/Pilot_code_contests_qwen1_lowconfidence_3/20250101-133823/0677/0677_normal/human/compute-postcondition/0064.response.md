According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `adjacents_list[v]`. The loop will execute if there are at least one element in `adjacents_list[v]`. 

Before the loop starts, we know that `len(stack)` is greater than 1, which ensures that the stack is not empty and has more than one element. Additionally, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`.

For the loop to execute, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this condition.

State: **`len(stack)` is greater than 1, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element**
