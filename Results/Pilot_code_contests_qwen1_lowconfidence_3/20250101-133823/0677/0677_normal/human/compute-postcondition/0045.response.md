The code snippet appends `u` to the list `q`. Based on the initial state, `u` is the last element that was removed from `q`, and `v` is the first element that was removed from `q`. The distance of `u` from the starting point is already updated to `distance[v] + 1`.

The output state after appending `u` to `q` is as follows:

- `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element for which `distance[u]` is `-1`
- `distance[u]` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` is set to `distance[v] + 1` for those where `distance[u]` was `-1`
- `q` now contains all elements except the first one and now includes `u`
- `v` is the first element that was removed from `q`
- `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` where `distance[u]` was `-1`

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element for which `distance[u]` is `-1`, `distance[u]` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` is set to `distance[v] + 1` for those where `distance[u]` was `-1`, `q` now contains all elements except the first one and now includes `u`, `v` is the first element that was removed from `q`, `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` where `distance[u]` was `-1`**
