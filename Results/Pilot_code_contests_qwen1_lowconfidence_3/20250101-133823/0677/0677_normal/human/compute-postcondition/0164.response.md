`determinate` is assigned the value `True`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`len(adjacents_list[v])` is greater than 0, at least one node in `adjacents_list[v]` is unvisited, the current value of `u` is visited (`visited[u]` is True), `pi[u]` is set to `v`, `determinate` is True, and the states of `stack`, `distances1[u]`, and `distances2[u]` remain as per the initial conditions; `stack` now includes `u`.**
