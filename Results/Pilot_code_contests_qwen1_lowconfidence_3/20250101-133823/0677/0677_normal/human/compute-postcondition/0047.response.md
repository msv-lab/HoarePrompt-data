Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element for which `distance[u]` is `-1`.
   - For all such elements `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`, `distance[u]` is set to `distance[v] + 1`.
   - `q` now contains all elements except the first one and now includes `u`.
   - `v` is the first element that was removed from `q`.

2. **Analyze the loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`.

3. **Determine what needs to change for the loop to execute one more time:**
   - For the loop to continue, there must be at least one `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` for which `distance[u]` is still `-1`. This ensures that the condition for the loop to run is met.
   - After processing each `u`, `u` is added to `q`. Therefore, `q` must include at least one new element that wasn't in `q` before the loop started.

4. **Adjust the states:**
   - Since `v` was removed from `q` and `u` is being added to `q`, we need to ensure that `v` is no longer the first element of `q` (it has been removed).
   - We also need to ensure that `q` contains at least one element `u` that satisfies the condition where `distance[u]` is `-1`.

Given these points, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

- `adjacents_list[v]` must still contain at least one element for which `distance[u]` is `-1`.
- `q` must now contain at least one element `u` that satisfies the condition where `distance[u]` is `-1` and the first element of `q` should not be `v`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element for which `distance[u]` is `-1`. For all such elements `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`, `distance[u]` is set to `distance[v] + 1`. `q` now contains at least one element `u` for which `distance[u]` is `-1`, and the first element of `q` is not `v`.**
