The code snippet appends the value of `u` to the `stack`. The value of `u` is the next unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`.

The initial conditions are:
- `len(stack)` is 3
- `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`
- `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node
- `u` is the next unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`
- `pi[u]` is `v`
- `visited[u]` is `True`
- `determinate` is `False`

After executing the code `stack.append(u)`, the length of `stack` increases by 1, and `u` is appended to the end of the stack.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is 4, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` has at least one unvisited node, `u` is the next unvisited node from `adjacents_list[v]`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `False`.**
