Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` is processed completely, for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` where `distance[u]` was `-1`, `distance[u]` is set to `distance[v] + 1`, `q` contains all elements except the first one (i.e., `len(q) >= 0`), and the first element of `q` is the next unprocessed vertex. If no elements in `adjacents_list[v]` had `distance[u]` as `-1`, then `distance[u]` remains unchanged and `q` does not change. Initially, `adjacents_list[v]` is empty and `distance[u]` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` is set to `distance[v] + 1` if `distance[u]` was `-1`. If the loop does not execute at all, then `adjacents_list[v]` is empty, `distance[u]` remains unchanged, and `q` remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop processes each element `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` and updates the distance of `u` if its distance was initially `-1`.
2. **Processing Completion**: After processing all elements in `adjacents_list[v]`, `q` will contain all remaining vertices to be processed, excluding the current vertex `v` (the first element removed from `q`).
3. **No Change**: If no elements in `adjacents_list[v]` had `distance[u]` as `-1`, then no changes are made to the distances or the queue `q`.

### Summary:
- If the loop completes, `adjacents_list[v]` is fully processed, and `distance[u]` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` where `distance[u]` was `-1` is updated to `distance[v] + 1`.
- If the loop does not execute, `adjacents_list[v]` remains empty, `distance[u]` remains unchanged, and `q` remains unchanged.
