`q` is appended with the value of `s`. The value of `s` remains unchanged, `distance` remains unchanged, `adjacents_list` remains unchanged, and `q` is now a deque containing the integer `s`. 

Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ n, `distance` is a list of n elements where the element at index `s-1` is `0` and all other elements are `-1`, `adjacents_list` is unchanged, `q` is a deque containing `s`.**
