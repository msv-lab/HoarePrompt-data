Output State: **`len(stack)` is at most 1 more than the number of nodes visited, `v` is the value of the previously top element in `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` is empty or all nodes in it have been visited, for every node `u` visited: `pi[u]` is the node `v` from which `u` was visited, `visited[u]` is `True`, `distances1[u]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to `u` considering the height constraints, and `distances2[u]` is the alternative shortest distance from the starting node to `u` considering the height constraints.**
