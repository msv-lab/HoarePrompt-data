Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that \(1 \leq s \leq n\); `distance` is a list where the element at index `s-1` is `0` and all other elements are `-1`; `adjacents_list` is unchanged; `q` is a deque containing the remaining elements (after removing `s`); `v` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q`; `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element; `distance[u]` is updated to `0` if `distance[u]` was `-1`.***
