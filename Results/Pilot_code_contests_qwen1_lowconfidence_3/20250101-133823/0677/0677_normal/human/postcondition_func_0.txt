The function `func_1()` accepts a parameter `stdin`, which is expected to be an object providing a `readline` method for reading input data. It reads the first line of input, splits it into two space-separated integers, converts them to integers using the `map` function, and returns a map object containing these integer values. The function does not perform any error handling for invalid input formats or missing data, so it assumes the input is correctly formatted as specified. If the input does not meet the expected format (e.g., more than two integers, non-integer values), the behavior is undefined and could lead to incorrect results or errors.
