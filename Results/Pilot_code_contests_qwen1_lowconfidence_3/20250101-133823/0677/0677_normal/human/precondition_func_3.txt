`adjacents_list` is a dictionary where keys are city numbers and values are lists of adjacent city numbers. `heights1` is a list of integers representing the height of each city, corresponding to the keys in `adjacents_list`. `distances1` and `distances2` are lists of integers initialized to a large value (e.g., infinity or a value larger than the maximum possible distance), and they represent the distances to be updated for the current city `s`.
