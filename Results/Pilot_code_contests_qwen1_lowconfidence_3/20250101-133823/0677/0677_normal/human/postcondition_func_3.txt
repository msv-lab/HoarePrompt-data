The function `func_4` accepts a city number `s` and updates the `distances1` and `distances2` lists based on the adjacency and height information stored in `adjacents_list` and `heights1`. Specifically, for each adjacent city `v` of `s`, it checks if the height of `v` plus one is greater than the current value in `distances1` or `distances2` for city `s`. If true, it updates `distances1` to reflect the new shortest path through `v` and sets `distances2` to the updated `distances1`. However, the current annotation is incomplete because it does not correctly reflect the intended logic. The correct postconditions should be: `distances1[s]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `heights1[v] + 1` for all `v` in `adjacents_list[s]`, and `distances2[s]` is updated to reflect the same minimum value but ensuring it is not less than the updated `distances1[s]`. An edge case to consider is when `adjacents_list[s]` is empty; in this case, no changes will be made to `distances1` or `distances2`. Additionally, the current annotation suggests that `distances2[s]` is reassigned to `distances1`, which is incorrect since `distances2` should store the updated shortest path.
