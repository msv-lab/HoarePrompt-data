k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Each sequence is represented as a pair of lines, where the first line contains an integer n_i (1 ≤ n_i < 2 ⋅ 10^5) indicating the length of the i-th sequence, and the second line contains a list of n_i integers a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, ..., a_{i, n_i} representing the elements of the sequence. The elements of the sequences are integers ranging from -10^4 to 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all given sequences does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
