The code `s = sum(arr)` calculates the sum of the elements in the list `arr` and assigns it to the variable `s`. The previous value of `s` was the sum of the elements in `sk`, but now it is updated to the sum of the elements in `arr`.

Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with pairs (i - s, (l, arr.index(i) + 1)) for each unique i in sk where i - s appears more than once, 'jam' is [arr, arr], `flag` is 0, `l` is `k`, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr`**
