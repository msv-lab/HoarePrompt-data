According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the set `sk`. If `i` is within the set `sk`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the state of `tk` is such that it contains a key `i - s` with a value containing more than one element, specifically `[ (l, arr.index(i) + 1) ]` as one of its elements, and no other changes to `tk`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be an element of `sk`. Since the only information we have about the current state of `tk` is the structure of its contents, we know that `i - s` must be a key in `tk` and that the value associated with this key must include the specified element `[ (l, arr.index(i) + 1) ]`.

Therefore, for the loop to continue, `i` must be in `sk` and the conditions related to `tk` should remain the same.

State: **`tk` is a dictionary with key `i - s` that has a value containing more than one element, specifically `[ (l, arr.index(i) + 1) ]` as one of its elements, and no other changes to `tk`. The condition evaluates to true if `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`. Additionally, `i` must be an element of `sk`.**
