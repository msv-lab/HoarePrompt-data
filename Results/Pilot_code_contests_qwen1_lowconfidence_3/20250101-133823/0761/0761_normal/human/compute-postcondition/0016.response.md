The code prints the sum of the first element of the tuple in `tk[i - s][0]` and 1, followed by a space, and then the second element of the tuple in `tk[i - s][0]`.

Given the initial state:
- `tk` is a dictionary with a key `i - s` that has a value containing more than one element, specifically `[ (l, arr.index(i) + 1) ]` as one of its elements.
- `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`.

Let's denote the first element of the tuple in `tk[i - s][0]` as `a` and the second element as `b`. Since `tk[i - s][0]` is explicitly given as `[ (l, arr.index(i) + 1) ]`, we know that:
- `a = l`
- `b = arr.index(i) + 1`

Therefore, the code will print:
- The sum of `l` and 1, which is `l + 1`
- Followed by `arr.index(i) + 1`

The output of the print statement will be:
```
(l + 1) (arr.index(i) + 1)
```

Since the print function does not change the values of the variables, the only thing that happens is that the values of `a` and `b` are used to construct the string printed.

Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with a key `i - s` that has a value containing more than one element, specifically `[ (l, arr.index(i) + 1) ]` as one of its elements, and no other changes to `tk`; `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`; the output of the print statement is `(l + 1) (arr.index(i) + 1)`**
