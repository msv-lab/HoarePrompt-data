Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variable and Collection**: The loop variable is `i` and it iterates over `sk`, which is a list of unique integers from the list `arr`.

2. **Determine Necessary Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `sk` must contain at least one element. If `sk` is empty, the loop will not execute.

3. **Current State**:
   - `k` is between 2 and 2⋅10^5.
   - `tk` is an empty dictionary `{}`.
   - `jam` is `[arr]`.
   - `flag` is 0.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `ni` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is a list of integers from the input string.
   - `s` is the sum of `arr`.
   - `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `sk` is not empty. Since `sk` contains unique integers from `arr`, and `arr` is a list of integers, `sk` will only be non-empty if `arr` contains at least one unique integer.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - Ensure `sk` is not empty. This means there must be at least one unique integer in `arr`.

State: **`k` is between 2 and 2⋅10^5, `tk` is an empty dictionary `{}`, `jam` is `[arr]`, `flag` is 0, `l` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`, `sk` must contain at least one unique integer from `arr`**
