The code `exit(0)` causes the program to terminate immediately with a status code of 0. Since the program terminates, no further actions are taken, and all variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`; prints `l + 1` `arr.index(i) + 1`**
