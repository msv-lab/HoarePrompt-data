The code appends a tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to the list `tk[i - s]`. Based on the initial state, `tk[i - s]` is `[(k, arr.index(i) + 1)]`. Therefore, after executing the code, `tk[i - s]` will become `[(k, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`.

All other variables remain unchanged:
- `jam` remains `[arr, arr]`
- `flag` remains `0`
- `l` remains `k`
- `ni` remains an input integer
- `arr` remains a new list of integers from the input string
- `s` remains the sum of `arr`
- `sk` remains a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element
- `i` remains the next unique integer in `sk`

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is `[(k, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`, `jam` is `[arr, arr]`, `flag` is 0, `l` is `k`, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a new list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element, `i` is the next unique integer in `sk`**
