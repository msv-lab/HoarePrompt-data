`jam` appends the list `arr` to itself. This means that `jam` now contains two elements: the original `arr` and the new `arr`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with pairs (i - s, (l, arr.index(i) + 1)) for each unique i in sk where i - s appears more than once, 'jam' is [arr, arr], `flag` is 0, `l` is `k`, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr`**
