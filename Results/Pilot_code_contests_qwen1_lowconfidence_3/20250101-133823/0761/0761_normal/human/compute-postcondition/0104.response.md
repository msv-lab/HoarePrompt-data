`tk[i - s]` is a list containing the tuple `(a + 1, b)`. The value of `i` is updated to the original value of `i` plus 2. The code appends a new tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to the list `tk[i - s]`. Since `arr.index(i) + 1` is calculated using the updated value of `i`, the new tuple will be appended.

To determine the exact values, let's assume some specific values for clarity (since the actual values of `a`, `b`, `l`, `s`, and `arr` are not provided):

- Let's say `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `l = 3`, `s = 0`, and `i` was originally `1`.
- Then `i` is now `1 + 2 = 3`.
- So `tk[3 - 0]` is a list containing the tuple `(1 + 1, 2)`, which is `(2, 2)`.
- The code appends `(3, arr.index(3) + 1)` to this list.
- Assuming `arr` is such that `arr.index(3) = 2` (for example, if `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]`), then `arr.index(3) + 1 = 3`.

Thus, the new tuple is `(3, 3)`, and it is appended to `tk[3]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `sk` remains a non-empty dictionary.
- `tk[i - s]` now contains the tuple `(2, 2)` and the new tuple `(3, 3)`.
- `i` is now `3`.

Output State: **`sk` is a non-empty dictionary, `tk[i - s]` contains the tuples `(2, 2)` and `(3, 3)`, `i` is 3**.
