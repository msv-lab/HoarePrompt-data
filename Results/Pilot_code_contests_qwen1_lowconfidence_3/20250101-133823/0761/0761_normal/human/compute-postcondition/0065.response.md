Postcondition: ***`tk[i - s]` is `[(k, arr.index(i) + 1)]`, `jam` is `[arr, arr]`, `flag` is 0, `l` is `k`, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a new list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element, `i` is the next unique integer in `sk`, and if `len(tk[i - s]) > 1` and `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, the program prints `str(arr.index(i) + 1) + ' ' + str(arr.index(i) + 1)`. Otherwise, the program does not print anything.***
