The code `exit(0)` is used to terminate the program immediately with a status code of 0. This means that no further instructions in the program will be executed. Therefore, the variables `sk`, `tk[i - s]`, `i`, and `tk` remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`sk` is not an empty dictionary, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the new tuple `(a + 1, b)`, `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1, `tk` contains other keys and values as before.**
