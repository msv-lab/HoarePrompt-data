State: **`k` is between 2 and 2â‹…10^5, `tk` is an empty dictionary {}, `jam` is an empty list [], `flag` is 0, `l` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop iterates over the range of `k`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be greater than 0 (since `range(k)` will start from 0).
3. Before the loop starts, `l` should be initialized to 0, as it is the starting index of the range.
4. The values of `tk`, `jam`, and `flag` do not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `l` is set to 0.
- `k` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes at least once.
