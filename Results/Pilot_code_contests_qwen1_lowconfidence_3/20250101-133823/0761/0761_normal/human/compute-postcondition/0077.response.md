`ni` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `tk` is a dictionary with keys as unique differences between elements in `sk` and `s`, and values as lists of tuples containing the index of the element in `arr` and its value from `arr` such that there are at least two elements in `arr` whose difference is the key, `jam` is `[arr, arr]`, `flag` is 0, `l` is `k + 1`, `ni` is the integer input, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr`.
