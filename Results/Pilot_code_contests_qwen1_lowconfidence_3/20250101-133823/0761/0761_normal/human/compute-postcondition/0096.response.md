The code `print('YES')` does not change any variable values or states; it only prints the string 'YES'. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`sk` is not an empty dictionary, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the new tuple `(l, arr.index(i + 1) + 1)`, `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1, `tk` contains other keys and values as before.**
