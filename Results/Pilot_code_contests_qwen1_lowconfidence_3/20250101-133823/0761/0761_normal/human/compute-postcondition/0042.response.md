The code snippet reads a list of integers from the input and converts it into a list using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This means the `arr` variable is updated with the new list of integers. The other variables (`tk`, `jam`, `flag`, `l`, `ni`, `s`, and `sk`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with pairs (i - s, (l, arr.index(i) + 1)) for each unique i in sk where i - s appears more than once, 'jam' is [arr], `flag` is 0, `l` is `k`, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr`**.
