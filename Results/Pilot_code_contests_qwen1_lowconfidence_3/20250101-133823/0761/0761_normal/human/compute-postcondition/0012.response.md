`tk[i - s]` is accessed and appended with a tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`. Given the initial state, `tk` is a dictionary with a key `i - s` set to an empty list. This means `tk[i - s]` exists and is an empty list. After appending the tuple, `tk[i - s]` will contain this single tuple.

Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with key `i - s` having the value `[ (l, arr.index(i) + 1) ]`, `tk` contains no other changes.**
