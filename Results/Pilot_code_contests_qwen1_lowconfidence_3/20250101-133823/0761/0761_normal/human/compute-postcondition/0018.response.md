The code `exit(0)` causes the program to terminate immediately without further execution of any subsequent code. Since the code does not modify any variables or perform any operations, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with a key `i - s` that has a value containing more than one element, specifically `[ (l, arr.index(i) + 1) ]` as one of its elements, and no other changes to `tk`; `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`**
