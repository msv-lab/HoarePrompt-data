The code assigns the value of `tk.get(i - s, [])` to `tk[i - s]`. Given the initial state, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing a new tuple `(a + 1, b)`. Since `tk.get(i - s, [])` will return the current value of `tk[i - s]`, which is `[a + 1, b]`, the value of `tk[i - s]` remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`sk` is a non-empty dictionary, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the tuple `(a + 1, b)`, `i` is the original value of `i` plus 2, and `tk` contains other keys and values as before.**
