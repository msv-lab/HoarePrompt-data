`s` is assigned the value of the sum of the list `arr`. The sum function calculates the sum of all elements in the list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is between 2 and 2⋅10^5, `tk` is an empty dictionary {}, `jam` is `[arr]`, `flag` is 0, `l` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`.
