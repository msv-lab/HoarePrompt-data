`k` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state of `k` was that it is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. After executing the code, `k` will now hold the specific integer value entered by the user within the specified range.

Output State: **2 ≤ `k` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5**
