`tk[i - s]` is assigned the value of `tk.get(i - s, [])`. Here, `i - s` is evaluated using the current values of `i` and `s`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1. However, the exact value of `s` is not specified in the initial state, so we keep it as `s`.

- If `i - s` already exists in `tk`, its value remains unchanged and is now a list (possibly the same list as before if no other operations were performed on it).
- If `i - s` does not exist in `tk`, `tk[i - s]` is set to `[]` (an empty list).

Given that `sk` is not an empty dictionary and `tk` contains other keys and values as before, these variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`sk` is not an empty dictionary, `tk[i - s]` is either a list (if `i - s` was in `tk`) or an empty list (if `i - s` was not in `tk`), `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1, `tk` contains other keys and values as before.**
