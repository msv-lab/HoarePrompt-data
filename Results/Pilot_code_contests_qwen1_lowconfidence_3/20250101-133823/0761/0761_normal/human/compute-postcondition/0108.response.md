The code `exit(0)` terminates the program immediately without further execution of any subsequent statements. Therefore, no changes are made to the variables. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`sk` is a non-empty dictionary, `tk[i - s]` contains the tuples `(2, 2)` and `(3, 3)`, `i` is 3, the printed output is '4 3'**
