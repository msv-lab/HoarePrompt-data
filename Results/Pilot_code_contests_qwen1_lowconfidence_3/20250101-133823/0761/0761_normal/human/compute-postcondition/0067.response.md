The code `tk[i - s] = tk.get(i - s, [])` checks if the key `i - s` exists in the dictionary `tk`. If it does, it assigns the existing value to `tk[i - s]`. If it doesn't, it assigns an empty list to `tk[i - s]`.

Given the initial state:
- `tk[i - s]` is `[(k, arr.index(i) + 1)]`
- `jam` is `[arr, arr]`
- `flag` is 0
- `l` is `k`
- `ni` is an input integer
- `arr` is a new list of integers from the input string
- `s` is the sum of `arr`
- `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element
- `i` is the next unique integer in `sk`

Since `tk[i - s]` is already defined and not `None`, the code `tk[i - s] = tk.get(i - s, [])` will simply assign the existing value to itself, which is `[(k, arr.index(i) + 1)]`.

Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is `[(k, arr.index(i) + 1)]`, `jam` is `[arr, arr]`, `flag` is 0, `l` is `k`, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a new list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element, `i` is the next unique integer in `sk`**
