The code `sk = list(set(arr))` removes duplicates from the list `arr` and stores the result in `sk`. Since `arr` is a list of integers from the input string, `sk` will contain the unique integers from `arr`.

Output State: **`k` is between 2 and 2â‹…10^5, `tk` is an empty dictionary {}, `jam` is `[arr]`, `flag` is 0, `l` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr`**
