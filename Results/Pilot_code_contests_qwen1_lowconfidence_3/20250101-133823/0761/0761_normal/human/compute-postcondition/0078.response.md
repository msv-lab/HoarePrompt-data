The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to an integer type using `map(int, ...)` and then assigns the resulting list to `arr`. The variables `tk`, `jam`, `flag`, `l`, `ni`, `s`, `sk` remain unchanged from their previous states.

- `tk` is a dictionary with keys as unique differences between elements in `sk` and `s`, and values as lists of tuples containing the index of the element in `arr` and its value from `arr` such that there are at least two elements in `arr` whose difference is the key.
- `jam` is `[arr, arr]`.
- `flag` is 0.
- `l` is `k + 1`.
- `ni` is the integer input.
- `arr` is updated to the list of integers from the input string.
- `s` is the sum of `arr`.
- `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr`.

The output state is as follows:

Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with keys as unique differences between elements in `sk` and `s`, and values as lists of tuples containing the index of the element in `arr` and its value from `arr` such that there are at least two elements in `arr` whose difference is the key; `jam` is `[arr, arr]; `flag` is 0; `l` is `k + 1`; `ni` is the integer input; `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string; `s` is the sum of `arr`; `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr`.**
