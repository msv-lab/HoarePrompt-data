The code appends a tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to the list `tk[i - s]`. Since `tk[i - s]` is a new list if `i - s` is not already a key in `tk`, and given that `sk` must not be an empty dictionary, `tk` is not empty and `i - s` is a key in `tk`. The value of `tk[i - s]` is updated by appending the tuple. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sk` is not an empty dictionary; `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the appended tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`; `tk` contains other keys and values as before.**
