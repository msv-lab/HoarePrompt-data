`tk[i - s]` has an existing list of tuples, specifically `[ (l, arr.index(i) + 1) ]`. The code appends another tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to this list. Since `arr.index(i) + 1` is already known from the initial state, appending this tuple does not change its value.

Therefore, the updated list in `tk[i - s]` remains `[ (l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1) ]`.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is [ (l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1) ]**
