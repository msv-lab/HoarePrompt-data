The code `s = sum(arr)` calculates the sum of the elements in the list `arr` and assigns it to the variable `s`. This impacts the variable `s` by updating its value to the sum of the elements in `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `tk` is a dictionary with keys as unique differences between elements in `sk` and `s`, and values as lists of tuples containing the index of the element in `arr` and its value from `arr` such that there are at least two elements in `arr` whose difference is the key.
- `jam` is `[arr, arr, arr]`.
- `flag` is 0.
- `l` is `k + 1`.
- `ni` is the integer input.
- `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string.
- `s` is the sum of `arr`.
- `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr`.

After executing the code, the value of `s` is updated to the sum of the elements in `arr`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with keys as unique differences between elements in `sk` and the sum of `arr`, and values as lists of tuples containing the index of the element in `arr` and its value from `arr` such that there are at least two elements in `arr` whose difference is the key; `jam` is `[arr, arr, arr]`; `flag` is 0; `l` is `k + 1`; `ni` is the integer input; `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string; `s` is the sum of `arr`; `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr`.**
