Postcondition: ***`sk` is a non-empty dictionary and `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the new tuple `(a + 1, b)`. `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1, and `tk` contains other keys and values as before. If `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, then the condition holds true and `sk` remains unchanged. Otherwise, no change is made to the dictionary `sk`.***
