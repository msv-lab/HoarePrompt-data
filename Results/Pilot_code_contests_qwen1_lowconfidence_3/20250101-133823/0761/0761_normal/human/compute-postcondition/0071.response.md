The code prints the values from `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]`. Based on the initial state, `tk[i - s]` is `[(k, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`, so `tk[i - s][1][0]` is `arr.index(i) + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]` is also `arr.index(i) + 1`.

Therefore, the print statement outputs `(arr.index(i) + 1) (arr.index(i) + 1)`.

The output state remains unchanged except for the printed values. The values of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is `[(k, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`, `jam` is `[arr, arr]`, `flag` is 0, `l` is `k`, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a new list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element, `i` is the next unique integer in `sk`, printed output is `(arr.index(i) + 1) (arr.index(i) + 1)`**
