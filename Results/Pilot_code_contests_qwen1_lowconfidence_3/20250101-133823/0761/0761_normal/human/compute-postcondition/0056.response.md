Postcondition: ***`tk` is updated with the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` appended to the list `tk[i - s]` if `i - s` exists in `tk`, otherwise `tk[i - s]` is initialized to an empty list and the tuple is appended; `jam` is `[arr, arr]`; `flag` is 0; `l` is `k`; `ni` is an input integer; `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string; `s` is the sum of `arr`; `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element; if `len(tk[i - s]) > 1` and `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, the output is `str(tk[i - s][0][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][0][1])`; otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.***
