The code `exit(0)` terminates the program immediately without changing any variable values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`sk` is not an empty dictionary, `tk` contains other keys and values as before, `tk[i - s][0][0]` is equal to `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]`, `tk[i - s][1][0]` is `a`, `tk[i - s][1][1]` is `b`, and the program exits.**
