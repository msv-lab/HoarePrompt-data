The code prints the sum of the second elements of the tuple in `tk[i - s][1]` plus 1, followed by the second element itself. Given the initial state, `tk[i - s][1][0]` is `arr.index(i) + 1`, and `tk[i - s][1][1]` is also `arr.index(i) + 1`. Therefore, the printed output will be `(arr.index(i) + 1) + 1` followed by `arr.index(i) + 1`.

Since the code only involves printing and does not assign any new values to variables, the values of `tk` and `jam` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with a key `i - s` that has a value containing more than one element, specifically `[ (l, arr.index(i) + 1) ]` as one of its elements, and no other changes to `tk`; `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`; the output of the print statement is `(arr.index(i) + 1 + 1) (arr.index(i) + 1)`**
