The code `print('YES')` simply prints 'YES' to the console and does not affect any variable values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is [(l, arr.index(i) + 1)], `jam` is [arr, arr], `flag` is 0, `l` is `k`, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a new list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element, `i` is the next unique integer in `sk`.**
