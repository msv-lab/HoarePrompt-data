The code `sk = list(set(arr))` creates a new list `sk` containing unique elements from `arr`. Since `arr` is already defined as the new list of integers from the input string, the set operation removes any duplicate elements, and the list conversion ensures that `sk` contains only the unique elements in their original order from `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `tk` is a dictionary with pairs (i - s, (l, arr.index(i) + 1)) for each unique i in sk where i - s appears more than once,
- `jam` is `[arr, arr]`,
- `flag` is 0,
- `l` is `k`,
- `ni` is an input integer,
- `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string,
- `s` is the sum of `arr`,
- `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr`.

After executing the code `sk = list(set(arr))`, the value of `sk` is updated to contain the unique elements from `arr`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with pairs (i - s, (l, arr.index(i) + 1)) for each unique i in sk where i - s appears more than once, `jam` is [arr, arr], `flag` is 0, `l` is `k`, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr`**.
