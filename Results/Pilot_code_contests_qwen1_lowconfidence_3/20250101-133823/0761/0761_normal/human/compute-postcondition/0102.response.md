To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop modifies the variables and conditions based on the given information.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `sk` is a non-empty dictionary.
   - `tk[i - s]` is a list containing a new tuple `(a + 1, b)`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its original value.
   - `tk` contains other keys and values as before.
   - The condition `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]` must hold true for no changes to be made to `sk`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each key `i` in the dictionary `sk`.
   - Inside the loop, the tuple `(a + 1, b)` is added to the list `tk[i - s]`.
   - The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
   - The condition `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]` is checked.
     - If this condition holds true, no changes are made to `sk`.
     - If the condition does not hold true, the loop terminates early without modifying `sk`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `sk` is a non-empty dictionary.
   - `tk[i - s]` is a list containing a new tuple `(a + 1, b)`.
   - `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1.
   - `tk` contains other keys and values as before.
   - The condition `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]` must hold true.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the loop, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]` must still hold true for the next iteration.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `sk` is a non-empty dictionary (unchanged).
- `tk[i - s]` is a list containing a new tuple `(a + 1, b)` (unchanged).
- `i` is the original value of `i` plus 2 (since it was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration).
- `tk` contains other keys and values as before.
- The condition `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]` must hold true.

### Final Answer:
State: **`sk` is a non-empty dictionary, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing a new tuple `(a + 1, b)`, `i` is the original value of `i` plus 2, and `tk` contains other keys and values as before. The condition `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]` must hold true.**
