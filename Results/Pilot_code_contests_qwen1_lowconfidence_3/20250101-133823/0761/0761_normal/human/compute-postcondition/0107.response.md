The code prints the sum of the first elements of the second tuple in the list `tk[i - s]` plus one, and the second element of the same tuple. Given that `tk[i - s]` contains the tuples `(2, 2)` and `(3, 3)`, and considering `i` is 3, the relevant tuple is `(3, 3)`. 

1. `tk[i - s][1][0]` refers to the first element of the second tuple in `tk[i - s]`, which is `3`.
2. `tk[i - s][1][1]` refers to the second element of the same tuple, which is also `3`.

The expression inside the print statement becomes `str(3 + 1) + ' ' + str(3)`, which evaluates to `'4 3'`.

Since the print statement executes and outputs the result, the output state will include the printed value and the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`sk` is a non-empty dictionary, `tk[i - s]` contains the tuples `(2, 2)` and `(3, 3)`, `i` is 3, the printed output is '4 3'**
