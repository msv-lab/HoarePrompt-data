Postcondition: ***`tk` is a dictionary with key `i - s` that has a value containing more than one element, specifically `[ (l, arr.index(i) + 1) ]` as one of its elements, and no other changes to `tk`; if `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, the condition holds true. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged regardless of the if condition's evaluation.***
