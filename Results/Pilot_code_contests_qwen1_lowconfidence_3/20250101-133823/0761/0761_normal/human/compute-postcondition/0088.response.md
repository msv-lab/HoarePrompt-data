The code prints the sum of `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][0][1]` as a string. This does not modify the values of any variables; it only outputs them. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sk` is not an empty dictionary, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing at least two tuples, each tuple has the form `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `tk` contains other keys and values as before, and `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`; the output is the string representation of `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` followed by a space and then the string representation of `tk[i - s][0][1]`.**
