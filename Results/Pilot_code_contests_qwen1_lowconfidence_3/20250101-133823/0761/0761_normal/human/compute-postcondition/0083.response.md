The code snippet updates the dictionary `tk` by assigning a new list to the key `i - s` if that key does not already exist in the dictionary. However, the values of `i` and `s` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of the key `i - s`.

Given the initial state that `sk` must not be an empty dictionary, this condition remains unchanged because the code only affects the dictionary `tk`.

Output State: **`sk` must not be an empty dictionary; `tk[i - s]` is a new list if `i - s` is not already a key in `tk`, otherwise `tk[i - s]` retains its previous value**
