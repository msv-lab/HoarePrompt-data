The code `sk = list(set(arr))` removes duplicate elements from `arr` and stores them in `sk`. This means that `sk` will contain unique integers from `arr`.

- `arr` remains unchanged.
- `sk` is updated to contain the unique elements of `arr`.
- The other variables (`jam`, `flag`, `l`, `ni`, `s`, `tk`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with keys as unique differences between elements in `sk` and the sum of `arr`, and values as lists of tuples containing the index of the element in `arr` and its value from `arr` such that there are at least two elements in `arr` whose difference is the key; `jam` is `[arr, arr, arr]`; `flag` is 0; `l` is `k + 1`; `ni` is the integer input; `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string; `s` is the sum of `arr`; `sk` contains the unique integers from `arr`.**
