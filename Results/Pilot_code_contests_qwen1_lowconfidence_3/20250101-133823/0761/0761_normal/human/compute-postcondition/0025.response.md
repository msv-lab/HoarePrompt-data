The code prints the sum of the first element of the tuple in `tk[i - s][0]` plus 1, followed by the second element of the same tuple. Given the initial state, `tk[i - s]` is `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`. This means both tuples in the list are identical.

Let's break down the calculation:

- The first element of the tuple `tk[i - s][0]` is `l`.
- The second element of the tuple `tk[i - s][0]` is `arr.index(i) + 1`.

The code will print:
- The first part: `str(tk[i - s][0][0] + 1)` which is `str(l + 1)`.
- The second part: `str(tk[i - s][0][1])` which is `str(arr.index(i) + 1)`.

Therefore, the output will be: `(l + 1) (arr.index(i) + 1)`.

Since the code only prints the values and does not assign them to any variable, the values of `tk`, `i`, `s`, `l`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is [(l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]; prints (l + 1) (arr.index(i) + 1)**
