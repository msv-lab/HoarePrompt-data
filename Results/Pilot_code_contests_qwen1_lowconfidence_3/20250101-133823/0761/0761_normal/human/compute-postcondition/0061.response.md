The code snippet prints the sum of `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][0][1]`. Given the initial state:

- `tk[i - s]` is `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`
- `jam` is `[arr, arr]`
- `flag` is 0
- `l` is `k`
- `ni` is an input integer
- `arr` is a new list of integers from the input string
- `s` is the sum of `arr`
- `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element
- `i` is the next unique integer in `sk`

From the initial state, we know:
- `tk[i - s]` contains a tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`
- `tk[i - s][0][0]` is `l`
- `tk[i - s][0][1]` is `arr.index(i) + 1`

Since `l` is `k` and `i` is the next unique integer in `sk`, the values of `tk[i - s][0][0]` and `tk[i - s][0][1]` remain unchanged.

After the code is executed, the following values are printed:
- `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` which is `k + 1`
- `tk[i - s][0][1]` which is `arr.index(i) + 1`

The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is [(k, arr.index(i) + 1)], `jam` is `[arr, arr]`, `flag` is 0, `l` is `k`, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a new list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element, `i` is the next unique integer in `sk`, and the print statement outputs `str(k + 1) + ' ' + str(arr.index(i) + 1)`**
