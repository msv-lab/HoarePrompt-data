The code snippet updates the print statement based on the value stored in `tk[i - s]`. Let's break down the steps:

1. The initial state is given as `tk[i - s]` is `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`.
2. The code prints the value of `str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1])`.

Given `tk[i - s]` is `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`, we can see that `tk[i - s][1]` is `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`. So, the expression `tk[i - s][1][0]` refers to `l` and `tk[i - s][1][1]` refers to `arr.index(i) + 1`.

Therefore, the print statement will evaluate to:
- `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` which is `l + 1`
- `tk[i - s][1][1]` which is `arr.index(i) + 1`

So, the print statement will output `l + 1` followed by a space and then `arr.index(i) + 1`.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`; prints `l + 1` `arr.index(i) + 1`**
