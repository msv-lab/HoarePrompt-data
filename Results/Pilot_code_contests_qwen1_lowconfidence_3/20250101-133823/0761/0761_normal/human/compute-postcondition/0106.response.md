The code accesses the elements in the tuple `tk[i - s][0]`, which is `(2, 2)`, and adds 1 to the first element. It then prints the result of this operation. The second element of the tuple is not used in the print statement.

- `tk[i - s][0]` is `(2, 2)`.
- Adding 1 to the first element of the tuple gives `2 + 1 = 3`.

After executing the print statement, the variables `sk`, `tk`, and `i` remain unchanged. The output of the print statement is `3 2`.

Output State: **`sk` is a non-empty dictionary, `tk[i - s]` contains the tuples `(2, 2)` and `(3, 3)`, `i` is 3, the printed output is `3 2`**
