Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with keys as unique differences between elements in `sk` and `s`, and values as lists of tuples containing the index of the element in `arr` and its value from `arr` such that there are at least two elements in `arr` whose difference is the key, `jam` is `[arr, arr]`, `flag` is 0, `l` is `k`, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr`. The loop continues to iterate over each unique integer in `sk` until either a pair of indices satisfying the condition is found and printed, or all unique integers in `sk` are processed. If the loop completes without finding such a pair, the program exits without printing anything.**
