The code snippet updates the dictionary `tk` by appending a tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to the list `tk[i - s]`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The initial state of `tk` is defined as a dictionary with pairs (i - s, (l, arr.index(i) + 1)) for each unique i in `sk` where i - s appears more than once, and for all other cases `tk[i - s]` is an empty list.
2. The code snippet `tk[i - s].append((l, arr.index(i) + 1))` appends the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to the list `tk[i - s]`.

Since the initial state of `tk` is defined such that for each unique `i` in `sk`, if `i - s` appears more than once, `tk[i - s]` contains the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` for each occurrence. For all other cases, `tk[i - s]` is an empty list.

Given the code snippet, we append `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to the existing list in `tk[i - s]` if `i - s` exists in `tk`. If it doesn't exist, it gets initialized to an empty list and then the tuple is appended.

Therefore, the output state will include the updated `tk` with the additional tuple, while keeping all other variables in their original states except for `tk` which will now have the updated list.

Output State: **`tk` is updated with the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` appended to the list `tk[i - s]` if `i - s` exists in `tk`, otherwise `tk[i - s]` is initialized to an empty list and the tuple is appended; `jam` is `[arr, arr]; `flag` is 0; `l` is `k`; `ni` is an input integer; `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string; `s` is the sum of `arr`; `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element.**
