The code appends a tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to the list `tk[i - s]`. Given the initial state:

- `tk[i - s]` is an empty list.
- `jam` is `[arr, arr]`.
- `flag` is 0.
- `l` is `k`.
- `ni` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a new list of integers from the input string.
- `s` is the sum of `arr`.
- `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element.
- `i` is the next unique integer in `sk`.

After executing the line `tk[i - s].append((l, arr.index(i) + 1))`:

- `tk[i - s]` will now be a list containing one element, which is the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is [(l, arr.index(i) + 1)], `jam` is [arr, arr], `flag` is 0, `l` is `k`, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a new list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element, `i` is the next unique integer in `sk`.**
