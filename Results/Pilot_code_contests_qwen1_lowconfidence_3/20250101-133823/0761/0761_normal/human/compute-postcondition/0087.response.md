The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. This does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`sk` is not an empty dictionary, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing at least two tuples, each tuple has the form `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `tk` contains other keys and values as before, and `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`**
