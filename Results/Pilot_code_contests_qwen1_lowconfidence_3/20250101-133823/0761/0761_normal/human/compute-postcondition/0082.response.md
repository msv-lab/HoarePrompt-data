Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Variable and Condition:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in sk:`.
   - This means that the loop will iterate over each key in the dictionary `sk`.

2. **Determine the Requirement for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, the variable `sk` must contain at least one key. If `sk` is empty, the loop will not execute.

3. **List of Variables Involved:**
   - `tk`: A dictionary that is not directly relevant to the loop condition.
   - `jam`: A list that is not directly relevant to the loop condition.
   - `flag`: An integer that is not directly relevant to the loop condition.
   - `l`: An integer that is not directly relevant to the loop condition.
   - `ni`: The integer input, which is not directly relevant to the loop condition.
   - `arr`: The new list of integers from the input string, which is not directly relevant to the loop condition.
   - `s`: The sum of `arr`, which is not directly relevant to the loop condition.
   - `sk`: A dictionary containing unique differences between elements in `arr` and the sum of `arr`, and values as lists of tuples containing the index of the element in `arr` and its value from `arr`.

4. **Ensure `sk` is Not Empty:**
   - Since the loop depends on the keys in `sk`, we need to ensure that `sk` is not an empty dictionary.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `sk` is not an empty dictionary.

### Final Answer:
State: **`sk` must not be an empty dictionary**
