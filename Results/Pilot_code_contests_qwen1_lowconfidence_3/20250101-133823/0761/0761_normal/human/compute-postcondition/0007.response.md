The code `jam.append(arr)` appends the list `arr` to the list `jam`. The value of `arr` is obtained from an input string, but its specific values are not given in the initial state. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is between 2 and 2⋅10^5, `tk` is an empty dictionary {}, `jam` is now a list containing `[arr]`, `flag` is 0, `l` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input string.
