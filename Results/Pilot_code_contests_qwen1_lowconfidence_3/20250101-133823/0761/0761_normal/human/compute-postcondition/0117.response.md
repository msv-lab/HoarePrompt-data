Functionality: **The function processes a series of sequences, each defined by a pair of lines: the first line contains an integer \( n_i \) indicating the length of the sequence, and the second line contains \( n_i \) integers. For each sequence, the function calculates the sum of the integers and identifies unique elements. It then checks if there exist two unique elements within the same sequence whose difference equals another element in the sequence. If such a pair is found, the function prints "YES" along with the indices of these elements and exits. If no such pair is found after processing all sequences, the function prints "NO". The function handles up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \) sequences, with each sequence containing up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \) integers, and the integers in each sequence range from \(-10^4\) to \(10^4\).**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If all elements in a sequence are the same, the function will correctly identify this and print "NO".
- If the input data does not conform to the specified constraints (e.g., the length of sequences exceeds \( 2 \times 10^5 \)), the function may encounter errors, though this is beyond the scope of the provided code and annotations.
- If the function is interrupted or if the input stream ends prematurely, the function will still process the sequences up to that point before printing "NO".

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not explicitly handle invalid inputs, such as non-integer values for sequence lengths or sequence elements, which could lead to runtime errors.
- There is no check for the maximum allowed number of sequences or the maximum length of sequences, which could cause the function to fail or produce incorrect results if the constraints are exceeded.
