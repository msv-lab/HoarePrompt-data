Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as `tk[i - s]` is `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`. This means that `tk[i - s]` contains two elements, both of which are tuples `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `sk`. The loop body is omitted, but we need to focus on the condition that triggers printing. Specifically, if `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i[i - s][1][0]]]`, then the function prints `l + 1` and `arr.index(i) + 1`.

3. **Determine the state change**: For the loop to continue, the condition `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]` must evaluate to `False`. This means that `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` must be equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`.

4. **Update the state**: Since the state does not change unless the condition is false, the state remains the same as the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`tk[i - s]` is `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`**
