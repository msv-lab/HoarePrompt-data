The code `print('YES')` does not affect any variable values; it only prints a string to the console. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with key `i - s` having the value containing more than one element, specifically `[ (l, arr.index(i) + 1) ]` as one of its elements, and no other changes to `tk`. The current value of `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`**
