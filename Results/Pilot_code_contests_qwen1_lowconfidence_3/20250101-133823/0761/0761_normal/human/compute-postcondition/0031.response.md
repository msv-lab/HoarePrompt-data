The code `tk[i - s] = tk.get(i - s, [])` checks if the key `i - s` exists in the dictionary `tk`. If it does, `tk[i - s]` remains unchanged and is still `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`. If it does not exist, `tk[i - s]` is set to an empty list `[]`.

Given the initial state, `tk[i - s]` is `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`. Since the code does not specify that `i - s` does not exist in `tk`, we assume it does exist.

Therefore, the value of `tk[i - s]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`**
