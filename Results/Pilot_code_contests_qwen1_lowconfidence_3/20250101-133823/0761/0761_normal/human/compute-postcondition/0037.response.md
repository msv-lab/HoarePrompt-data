Postcondition: ***`tk[i - s]` is `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`. If `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, we print `l + 1 arr.index(i) + 1`. Otherwise, no specific action is taken (i.e., the program continues as usual without modifying `tk[i - s]`).***
