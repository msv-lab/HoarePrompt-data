Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**: The for loop iterates over the list `sk`, which contains unique integers from `arr`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `tk` is a dictionary with pairs \((i - s, (l, arr.index(i) + 1))\) for each unique \(i\) in `sk` where \(i - s\) appears more than once.
   - `jam` is a list containing two copies of `arr`.
   - `flag` is 0.
   - `l` is `k`.
   - `ni` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string.
   - `s` is the sum of `arr`.
   - `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr`.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `sk` is not empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `sk` contains at least one element.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `tk`, `jam`, `flag`, `l`, `ni`, `arr`, `s`, and `sk` are all derived or initialized based on the input and do not directly affect the loop condition, we only need to ensure that `sk` is non-empty for the loop to execute.

5. **Final Adjusted State**:
   - We need to adjust the state such that `sk` contains at least one unique integer.

State: **`tk` is a dictionary with pairs (i - s, (l, arr.index(i) + 1)) for each unique i in sk where i - s appears more than once, `jam` is [arr, arr], `flag` is 0, `l` is `k`, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element**.
