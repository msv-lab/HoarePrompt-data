The code snippet prints the sum of 1 and the first element of the tuple in `tk[i - s][0]` followed by the second element of the same tuple. Let's break this down:

1. `tk[i - s][0]` refers to the first tuple in the list `tk[i - s]`.
2. `tk[i - s][0][0]` refers to the first element of that tuple.
3. `tk[i - s][0][1]` refers to the second element of that tuple.

Given the initial state: `tk[i - s]` is `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`.

- The first tuple in `tk[i - s]` is `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`.
- Therefore, `tk[i - s][0][0]` is `l`.
- And `tk[i - s][0][1]` is `arr.index(i) + 1`.

The code then prints the string representation of these two values concatenated together, which results in `"l+1 arr.index(i) + 1"`.

Since the print statement only affects the output and not the variables themselves, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`; prints "l+1 arr.index(i) + 1"**
