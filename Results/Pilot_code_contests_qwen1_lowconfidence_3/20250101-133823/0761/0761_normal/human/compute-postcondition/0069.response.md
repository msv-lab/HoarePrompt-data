The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console and does not change any variable values. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is `[(k, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`, `jam` is `[arr, arr]`, `flag` is 0, `l` is `k`, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a new list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element, `i` is the next unique integer in `sk`**
