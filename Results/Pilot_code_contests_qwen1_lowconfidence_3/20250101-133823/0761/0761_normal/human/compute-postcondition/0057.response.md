Let's break down the given state and the for loop step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:
- `tk` is updated with the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` appended to the list `tk[i - s]` if `i - s` exists in `tk`, otherwise `tk[i - s]` is initialized to an empty list and the tuple is appended.
- `jam` is `[arr, arr]`.
- `flag` is 0.
- `l` is `k`.
- `ni` is an input integer.
- `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string.
- `s` is the sum of `arr`.
- `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element.
- If `len(tk[i - s]) > 1` and `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, the output is `str(tk[i - s][0][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][0][1])`; otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in sk:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each `i` in `sk`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `tk` is updated based on the current `i`.
   - `jam` remains `[arr, arr]`.
   - `flag` remains 0.
   - `l` remains `k`.
   - `ni` remains the input integer.
   - `arr` is updated to a new list of integers from the input string.
   - `s` is the sum of `arr`.
   - `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element.

3. **What Changes?**:
   - `tk` might change as tuples are appended based on the condition.
   - `tk[i - s]` could be updated or initialized with new tuples.
   - `jam` remains unchanged.
   - `flag`, `l`, `ni`, `arr`, `s`, and `sk` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

### Adjusted States for Next Iteration:
For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `i` in the next iteration is the next unique integer in `sk`.

Since `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr`, and it is not explicitly modified within the loop body (assuming no changes to `sk`), the next value of `i` should be the next integer in the sorted order of `sk`.

Given that `i` is the current integer being processed, the next `i` will be the next unique integer in `sk`.

### Final State for Next Iteration:
State: **`tk` is updated with the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` appended to the list `tk[i - s]` if `i - s` exists in `tk`, otherwise `tk[i - s]` is initialized to an empty list and the tuple is appended; `jam` is `[arr, arr]`; `flag` is 0; `l` is `k`; `ni` is an input integer; `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string; `s` is the sum of `arr`; `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element; `i` is the next unique integer in `sk`.**

Note: The exact value of `i` cannot be determined without knowing the contents of `sk`, but we know it will be the next unique integer in the sorted order of `sk`.

State: **`tk` is updated with the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` appended to the list `tk[i - s]` if `i - s` exists in `tk`, otherwise `tk[i - s]` is initialized to an empty list and the tuple is appended; `jam` is `[arr, arr]`; `flag` is 0; `l` is `k`; `ni` is an input integer; `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string; `s` is the sum of `arr`; `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element; `i` is the next unique integer in `sk`.**
