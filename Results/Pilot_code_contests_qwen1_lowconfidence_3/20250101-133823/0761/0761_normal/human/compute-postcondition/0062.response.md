The code snippet prints `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]`. Given the initial state:

- `tk[i - s]` is `[(k, arr.index(i) + 1)]`
- `jam` is `[arr, arr]`
- `flag` is 0
- `l` is `k`
- `ni` is an input integer
- `arr` is a new list of integers from the input string
- `s` is the sum of `arr`
- `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element
- `i` is the next unique integer in `sk`

From `tk[i - s]`: `tk[i - s][1][0]` is `arr.index(i) + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]` is also `arr.index(i) + 1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
```
str(arr.index(i) + 1) + ' ' + str(arr.index(i) + 1)
```

This means the output will be two identical numbers separated by a space.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is `[(k, arr.index(i) + 1)]`, `jam` is `[arr, arr]`, `flag` is 0, `l` is `k`, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a new list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element, `i` is the next unique integer in `sk`, and the print statement outputs `str(arr.index(i) + 1) + ' ' + str(arr.index(i) + 1)`**.
