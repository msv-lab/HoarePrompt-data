Let's analyze the loop step by step and determine the final state of the variables after the loop has finished executing.

### Initial State
- `k` is between 2 and \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `tk` is an empty dictionary `{}`.
- `jam` is `[arr]`.
- `flag` is 0.
- `l` is 0.
- `ni` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input string.
- `s` is the sum of `arr`.
- `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr`.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over each unique integer `i` in `sk` and updates the dictionary `tk` with key `i - s`. It appends a tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to the list corresponding to the key `i - s`. If the length of the list corresponding to the key `i - s` exceeds 1, it checks if the values of `jam` at the positions specified by the tuples in `tk[i - s]` are different. If they are different, it prints the indices and exits the program.

### Key Observations
- The dictionary `tk` will store pairs of the form `(index, position)` where `index` is `i - s` and `position` is `l`.
- The list `sk` contains unique elements from `arr`.
- The variable `l` increments with each iteration of the loop.
- The condition inside the loop only triggers when there are at least two entries for the same key in `tk` and the corresponding `jam` values are different.

### Final State After Loop Execution
If the loop does not execute even once, the final state of the variables will be:
- `tk` remains `{}`.
- `jam` remains `[arr]`.
- `flag` remains 0.
- `l` remains 0.
- `ni` remains the input integer.
- `arr` remains the list of integers from the input string.
- `s` remains the sum of `arr`.
- `sk` remains a list of unique integers from `arr`.

If the loop executes at least once, the final state of the variables will be:
- `tk` will contain pairs `(i - s, (l, arr.index(i) + 1))` for each unique `i` in `sk` where `i - s` appears more than once.
- `jam` remains `[arr]`.
- `flag` remains 0.
- `l` will be the last index used in the loop.
- `ni` remains the input integer.
- `arr` remains the list of integers from the input string.
- `s` remains the sum of `arr`.
- `sk` remains a list of unique integers from `arr`.

However, if the condition inside the loop is met, the program will print indices and exit, thus the final state will not reflect the loop execution properly as it would stop.

### Conclusion
The final output state will be based on whether the loop executes at least once and meets the condition inside the loop.

**Output State:**
- If the loop does not execute, the output state is:
  ```
  tk is {} , 'jam' is [arr], flag is 0, l is 0, ni is the input integer, arr is the list of integers from the input string, s is the sum of arr, sk is a list of unique integers from arr.
  ```

- If the loop executes at least once and the condition inside the loop is met, the output state is:
  ```
  tk is a dictionary with pairs (i - s, (l, arr.index(i) + 1)) for each unique i in sk where i - s appears more than once, 'jam' is [arr], flag is 0, l is the last index used in the loop, ni is the input integer, arr is the list of integers from the input string, s is the sum of arr, sk is a list of unique integers from arr.
  ```

Thus, the overall output state can be summarized as follows:
```
tk is a dictionary with pairs (i - s, (l, arr.index(i) + 1)) for each unique i in sk where i - s appears more than once, 'jam' is [arr], flag is 0, l is the last index used in the loop, ni is the input integer, arr is the list of integers from the input string, s is the sum of arr, sk is a list of unique integers from arr.
