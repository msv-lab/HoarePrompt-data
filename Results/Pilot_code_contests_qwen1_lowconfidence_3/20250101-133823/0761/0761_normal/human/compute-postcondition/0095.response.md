`tk[i - s]` is appended with a tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`. Given the initial state, `tk[i - s]` is either a list or an empty list depending on whether `i - s` exists in `tk`. Since `i` is now `i + 1`, the new value being appended is `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, which translates to `(l, arr.index(i + 1) + 1)`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `tk[i - s]` is updated to include the new tuple `(l, arr.index(i + 1) + 1)`.
- `i` is now `i + 1`.

Output State: **`sk` is not an empty dictionary, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the new tuple `(l, arr.index(i + 1) + 1)`, `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1, `tk` contains other keys and values as before.**
