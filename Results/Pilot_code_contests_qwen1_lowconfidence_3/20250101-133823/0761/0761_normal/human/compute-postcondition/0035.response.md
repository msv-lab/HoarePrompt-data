The code `print(str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1]))` accesses elements of the list `tk[i - s]`. Given the initial state, `tk[i - s]` is `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`.

The code retrieves the second element of the list `tk[i - s]`, which is `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, and then adds 1 to the first element of this tuple. The second element of the tuple remains unchanged.

- The first element of the tuple is `l`, so `l + 1` is printed.
- The second element of the tuple is `arr.index(i) + 1`, so `arr.index(i) + 1` is printed.

Therefore, the output is `l + 1` followed by a space, followed by `arr.index(i) + 1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`, and we print `l + 1 arr.index(i) + 1`**
