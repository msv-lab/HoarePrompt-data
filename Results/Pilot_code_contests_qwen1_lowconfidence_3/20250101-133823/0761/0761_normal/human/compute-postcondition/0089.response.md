The code prints the string representation of `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` followed by a space and then the string representation of `tk[i - s][1][1]`. The values of `tk[i - s][1][0]` and `tk[i - s][1][1]` are taken from the dictionary `tk`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Since the exact values of `tk[i - s][1][0]` and `tk[i - s][1][1]` are not specified, let's denote them as `a` and `b` respectively. Thus, the code will print `str(a + 1) + ' ' + str(b)`, which is a string concatenation of the value of `a + 1` and `b`.

Output State: **`sk` is not an empty dictionary, `tk` contains other keys and values as before, `tk[i - s][0][0]` is equal to `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]`, `tk[i - s][1][0]` is `a`, `tk[i - s][1][1]` is `b`, and the output is the string `str(a + 1) + ' ' + str(b)`**.
