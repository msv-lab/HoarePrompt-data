The code prints the values of `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][0][1]`. Since the initial state specifies that `tk[i - s]` is a list containing tuples and its length is greater than 1, and `tk[i - s][0][0]` and `tk[i - s][0][1]` exist, the code will print these values.

However, the values of `tk[i - s][0][0]` and `tk[i - s][0][1]` are not provided explicitly. Therefore, we will denote them as `a` and `b` respectively. The output will be `a + 1` and `b`.

The other variables (`jam`, `flag`, `l`, `ni`, `arr`, `s`, `sk`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their initial states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tk[i - s][0][0]` is `a`, `tk[i - s][0][1]` is `b`, and the output is `str(a + 1) + ' ' + str(b)`; `jam` is `[arr, arr]`, `flag` is 0, `l` is `k`, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element.**
