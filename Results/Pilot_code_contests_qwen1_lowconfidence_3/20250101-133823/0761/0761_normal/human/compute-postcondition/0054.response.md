The code `exit(0)` causes the program to terminate immediately without further execution of the subsequent lines of code. This means that no variables are modified, and the program does not proceed to any further statements.

Output State: **`tk[i - s][0][0]` is `a`, `tk[i - s][0][1]` is `b`, the output is `str(a + 1) + ' ' + str(b)'; `jam` is `[arr, arr]`, `flag` is 0, `l` is `k`, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element**
