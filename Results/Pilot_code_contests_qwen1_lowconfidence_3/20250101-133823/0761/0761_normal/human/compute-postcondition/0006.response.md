The code `arr = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from input and converts each element to an integer, storing them in the list `arr`. The previous values of `k`, `tk`, `jam`, `flag`, `l`, and `ni` remain unchanged.

Since the input is read from the user, let's denote the input as `input_string`. After executing the code, `arr` will contain the integers from `input_string`.

Output State: **`k` is between 2 and 2â‹…10^5, `tk` is an empty dictionary {}, `jam` is an empty list [], `flag` is 0, `l` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input string**
