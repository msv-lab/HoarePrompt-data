The code `tk[i - s] = tk.get(i - s, [])` updates the dictionary `tk` by adding the key `i - s` with an empty list as its value if it doesn't already exist. The value of `tk[i - s]` is set to an empty list if `i - s` is not already a key in `tk`.

Given the initial state:
- `tk` is a dictionary with pairs (i - s, (l, arr.index(i) + 1)) for each unique i in `sk` where i - s appears more than once.
- `jam` is `[arr, arr]`.
- `flag` is `0`.
- `l` is `k`.
- `ni` is an input integer.
- `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string.
- `s` is the sum of `arr`.
- `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element.

Since the code only updates the dictionary `tk` by ensuring `tk[i - s]` is an empty list if it's not already defined, the output state will include this update:

Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with pairs (i - s, (l, arr.index(i) + 1)) for each unique i in `sk` where i - s appears more than once, and for all other cases `tk[i - s]` is an empty list; `jam` is `[arr, arr]; `flag` is 0; `l` is `k`; `ni` is an input integer; `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string; `s` is the sum of `arr`; `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element.**
