The `exit(0)` function call terminates the program immediately without further execution of the remaining code. Since the program stops executing right away, no changes are made to any variables. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is `[(k, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`, `jam` is `[arr, arr]`, `flag` is 0, `l` is `k`, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a new list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` that must contain at least one element, `i` is the next unique integer in `sk`, printed output is `(arr.index(i) + 1) (arr.index(i) + 1)`**
