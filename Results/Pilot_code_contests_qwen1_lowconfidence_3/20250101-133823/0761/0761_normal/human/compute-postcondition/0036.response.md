The code `exit(0)` causes the program to terminate immediately without further execution of the subsequent lines. This means no changes are made to any variables, and the only information from the initial state that remains is what was printed before the exit.

Given the initial state: `tk[i - s]` is `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`, and we print `l + 1 arr.index(i) + 1`.

Since the program exits immediately after printing, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the print statement executed.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`, and we print `l + 1 arr.index(i) + 1`.**
