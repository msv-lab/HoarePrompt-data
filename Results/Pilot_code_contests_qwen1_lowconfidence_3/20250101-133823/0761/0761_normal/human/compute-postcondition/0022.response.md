The code `tk[i - s] = tk.get(i - s, [])` checks if the key `i - s` exists in the dictionary `tk`. Since the initial state specifies that `tk[i - s]` already exists and contains `[ (l, arr.index(i) + 1) ]` as one of its elements, the `get` method will not add a new list to `tk[i - s]` because the key `i - s` already has a value. Therefore, the value of `tk[i - s]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with key `i - s` that has a value containing more than one element, specifically `[ (l, arr.index(i) + 1) ]` as one of its elements, and no other changes to `tk`.**
