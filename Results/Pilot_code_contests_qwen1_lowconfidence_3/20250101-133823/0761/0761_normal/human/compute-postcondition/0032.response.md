The initial state is `tk[i - s]` is `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`. The code snippet `tk[i - s].append((l, arr.index(i) + 1))` appends a new tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to the list `tk[i - s]`.

Given the initial state:
- `tk[i - s]` is currently `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`.

After executing the code, the list `tk[i - s]` will have one more element appended to it. Therefore, the updated list will be:
- `tk[i - s]` is now `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1), (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`**
