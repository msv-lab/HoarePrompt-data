The code `jam.append(arr)` appends the list `arr` to the list `jam`. Since `jam` was initially `[arr, arr]`, after appending `arr` again, `jam` will be `[arr, arr, arr]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with keys as unique differences between elements in `sk` and `s`, and values as lists of tuples containing the index of the element in `arr` and its value from `arr` such that there are at least two elements in `arr` whose difference is the key; `jam` is `[arr, arr, arr]`; `flag` is 0; `l` is `k + 1`; `ni` is the integer input; `arr` is the new list of integers from the input string; `s` is the sum of `arr`; `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr`.**
