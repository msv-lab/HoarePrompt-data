The code `ni = int(raw_input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `ni`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with pairs (i - s, (l, arr.index(i) + 1)) for each unique i in sk where i - s appears more than once, 'jam' is [arr], flag is 0, l is k, `ni` is an input integer, arr is the list of integers from the input string, s is the sum of arr, sk is a list of unique integers from arr.**
