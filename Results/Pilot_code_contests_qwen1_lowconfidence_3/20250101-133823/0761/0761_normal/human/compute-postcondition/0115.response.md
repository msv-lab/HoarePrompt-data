Postcondition: ***`tk` is a dictionary with keys as unique differences between elements in `sk` and `s`, and values as lists of tuples containing the index of the element in `arr` and its value from `arr` such that there are at least two elements in `arr` whose difference is the key, `jam` is a list of `k` copies of `arr`, `flag` is 0, `l` is `k`, `ni` is the input integer, `arr` is the list of integers from the input string, `s` is the sum of `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr`, and the output is 'NO'.***
