Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find two sequences and indices such that removing one element from each results in equal sums. Hereâ€™s why:

1. The program iterates through each sequence and calculates its sum.
2. For each unique element in the sequence, it calculates the difference between the element and the sum of the sequence. This difference represents what the remaining sum would be if that element were removed.
3. It stores these differences and their corresponding sequence and index in a dictionary.
4. If it finds two different sequences that have the same difference for an element, it prints "YES" along with the required indices and exits.
5. If no such pair is found after checking all sequences, it prints "NO".

This approach ensures that the program checks all possible pairs of sequences and indices, which aligns with the problem description. Since the program covers all necessary steps and conditions, it should work correctly for all valid inputs as per the problem statement.
