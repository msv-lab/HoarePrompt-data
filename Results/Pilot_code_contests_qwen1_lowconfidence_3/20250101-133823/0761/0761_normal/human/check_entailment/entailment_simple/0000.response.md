Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of sequences `k` and processes each sequence.
   - For each sequence, it reads the length `n_i` and the sequence itself.
   - The program handles the input within the specified constraints: \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq n_i < 2 \cdot 10^5\).

2. **Sum Calculation and Matching Elements**:
   - For each sequence, the program calculates the sum `s` of the elements.
   - It then finds unique elements in the sequence and checks if there are any pairs of elements whose difference matches the difference between their sums (i.e., `i - s`).
   - If such a pair is found and they belong to different sequences, it prints "YES" along with the indices of the elements to be removed from each sequence.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - If no such pair is found after processing all sequences, the program prints "NO".

Here is a more detailed step-by-step analysis:

- **Initialization**:
  ```python
  k = int(raw_input())
  tk = dict()
  jam = []
  flag = 0
  ```

- **Processing each sequence**:
  ```python
  for l in range(k):
      ni = int(raw_input())
      arr = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
      jam.append(arr)
      
      s = sum(arr)
      
      sk = list(set(arr))
      
      for i in sk:
          tk[i - s] = tk.get(i - s, [])
          tk[i - s].append((l, arr.index(i) + 1))
          if len(tk[i - s]) > 1:
              if jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]:
                  print('YES')
                  print(str(tk[i - s][0][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][0][1]))
                  print(str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1]))
                  exit(0)
  ```

- **Final Output**:
  ```python
  if (not flag):
      print('NO')
  ```

### Key Points:
- **Correct Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input and processes each sequence according to the problem statement.
- **Sum Calculation and Matching**: The program calculates the sum of each sequence and uses a dictionary to store potential matches, ensuring that the difference between the elements and the sum of the sequence is checked.
- **Output Formatting**: The program prints "YES" with the correct indices when a valid pair is found, and "NO" otherwise.

Since the program follows the exact logic and constraints specified in the problem description, it is correct.
