Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of sequences \( k \) and processes each sequence. Each sequence is read as a list of integers, and the sum of the elements in each sequence is calculated.

2. **Unique Elements and Sum Calculation**: For each sequence, the program calculates the sum \( s \) and identifies unique elements. It then checks if there are any pairs of unique elements \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( i - j \) exists in the sequence and \( i - j = \text{some element in the sequence} \).

3. **Condition Checking**: If such a pair is found, the program prints "YES" along with the indices of the elements and exits. Specifically, it prints the indices of the sequence and the respective elements' positions.

4. **Output Handling**: If no such pair is found after processing all sequences, the program prints "NO".

5. **Correctness of Logic**: The logic ensures that the program checks all possible pairs of unique elements for each sequence, and it correctly identifies if there are two sequences that can be modified to have equal sums by removing one element each.

Given the steps above, the program accurately follows the problem description and meets all the specified requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
