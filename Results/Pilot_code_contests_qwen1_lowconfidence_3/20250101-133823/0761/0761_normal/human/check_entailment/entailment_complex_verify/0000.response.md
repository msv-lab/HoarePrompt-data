Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the provided annotated version of the code and the original assessment, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The program processes each sequence, calculates the sum, and identifies unique elements to check for pairs that satisfy the condition of having equal sums after removing one element from each sequence. 

Here are the key points supporting the correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input and processes each sequence.
2. It calculates the sum of each sequence and identifies unique elements.
3. For each unique element, it computes the difference between the element and the sum of the sequence, storing these differences in a dictionary.
4. If it finds two different sequences with the same difference for an element, it prints "YES" along with the required indices and exits.
5. If no such pair is found, it prints "NO".

The annotated version confirms that the program checks all sequences and indices thoroughly, covering all necessary conditions as outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness remains accurate.
