Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the code is looking for two unique elements within the same sequence whose difference equals another element in the sequence, which is not what the problem requires. The problem requires finding two different sequences such that removing one element from each results in equal sums.

Here is an example that highlights the issue:

### Example:
Input:
```
2
5
2 3 1 3 2
6
1 1 2 2 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
2 6
1 2
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

The code fails to find the correct pairs of sequences. The correct approach would be to:
1. Calculate the sum of each sequence.
2. Store the sums and their corresponding indices.
3. Check if there are two different sequences whose sums minus the removed element are equal.

The current implementation does not check across different sequences, hence it cannot identify the correct pairs as required by the problem statement.
