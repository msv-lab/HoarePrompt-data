Final: **True**

Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find two sequences and indices such that removing one element from each results in equal sums. Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of sequences `k` and then reads each sequence along with its elements, which matches the input format specified in the problem description.
2. **Sum Calculation and Difference Storage**: For each sequence, the program calculates the sum `s` and then iterates over the unique elements to store the difference between each element and the sum in the dictionary `tk`. This helps in identifying pairs of sequences that can have their sums equal after removing one element.
3. **Condition Check**: The program checks if there are two different sequences with the same difference for an element. If such a pair is found, it prints "YES" along with the required indices and exits.
4. **Output Handling**: If no such pair is found after checking all sequences, it prints "NO".

The annotated version confirms that the program follows the described logic step-by-step and handles the input and output as specified. There are no logical errors or omissions in the code that would lead to incorrect behavior under the given constraints. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
