Final: **False**

Reasoning: 

The original assessment states that the program correctly implements the logic to find two sequences and indices such that removing one element from each results in equal sums. However, upon closer inspection and based on the output hints provided, the program has a logical flaw in how it identifies and processes the sequences.

The key issue lies in the following part of the code:
```python
for i in sk:
    tk[i - s] = tk.get(i - s, [])
    tk[i - s].append((l, arr.index(i) + 1))
    if len(tk[i - s]) > 1:
        if jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]:
            print('YES')
            print(str(tk[i - s][0][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][0][1]))
            print(str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1]))
            exit(0)
```

- `sk` is a list of unique elements in the current sequence.
- `tk[i - s]` is used to store the indices of elements in the sequence that have a specific difference with the total sum `s`.
- The condition `if len(tk[i - s]) > 1:` checks if there are more than one element with the same difference. However, this condition only checks within the same sequence and does not compare between different sequences.

The problem requires finding two sequences where removing one element from each makes their sums equal. The provided code only checks for such pairs within the same sequence, which is not sufficient. It fails to identify pairs from different sequences as specified in the problem description.

Given this analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described, hence the final assessment is **False**.
