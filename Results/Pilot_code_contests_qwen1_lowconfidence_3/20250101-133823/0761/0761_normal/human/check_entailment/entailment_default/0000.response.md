Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the code checks for pairs of unique elements within the same sequence to see if their difference exists in the sequence, but it does not compare the sums of two different sequences as required by the problem statement.

The problem requires finding two different sequences such that removing exactly one element from each results in equal sums. However, the code only considers the sums within individual sequences and does not compare sums across different sequences.

Here is an example that demonstrates why the code fails:

Consider the following input:
```
2
3
1 2 3
4
4 1 2 3
```

The correct output should be:
```
YES
1 2
2 3
```

However, the provided code would not produce the correct output because it only checks within each sequence, not between sequences.

Since the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, the correctness is **False**.
