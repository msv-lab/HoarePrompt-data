The function processes a series of sequences, each defined by a pair of lines: the first line contains an integer \( n_i \) indicating the length of the sequence, and the second line contains \( n_i \) integers. For each sequence, the function calculates the sum of the integers and identifies unique elements. It then checks if there exist two unique elements within the same sequence whose difference equals another element in the sequence. If such a pair is found, the function prints "YES" along with the indices of these elements and exits. If no such pair is found after processing all sequences, the function prints "NO". The function handles up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \) sequences, with each sequence containing up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \) integers, and the integers in each sequence range from \(-10^4\) to \(10^4\).
