The function `func_5()` reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input and returns a map object containing those integers. The input line is expected to contain exactly as many integers as specified by the variable `n`, which should be provided as part of the initial program state (though it is not defined within the function). The function does not modify any external state and relies on user input to provide the data it processes. No error handling is included for invalid input or cases where the input format differs from expectations. Potential edge cases include input lines with fewer or more integers than specified by `n`, non-integer values, or empty input.
