The function `func_7()` opens two files, `input.txt` for reading and `output.txt` for writing, but does not perform any operations on the input parameters `n`, `a`, or `b`. As a result, the function does not process the lists `a` and `b` according to their specified properties. Instead, it simply sets up file streams for input and output without utilizing these inputs in any way. The function leaves the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` unchanged and does not produce any output in `output.txt`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the file streams are opened, but no further processing of `a` and `b` occurs.
