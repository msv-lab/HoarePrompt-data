The function `func_8` accepts two integers `x` and `y` (with `y` not being zero). It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `x` with `y` and `y` with `x % y` until `y` becomes zero. At the end of the function, it returns `x` as the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and sets `y` to 0. Potential edge cases include when `x` or `y` is negative; however, the function does not handle these cases, so the GCD computation may not be as expected in such scenarios. The function does not handle the case where both `x` and `y` are zero, which would result in an undefined behavior since `y` cannot be zero at the start.
