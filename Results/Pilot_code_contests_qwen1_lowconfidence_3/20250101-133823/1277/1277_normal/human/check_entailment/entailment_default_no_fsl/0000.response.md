Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided in `func_12` does not handle the case where all elements in `b` are `-1`. In such a scenario, the loop that updates `l` and the subsequent sorting and processing of `l1` would not contribute any value to `ans`. However, the problem description specifies that the maximum possible `ans` should still be calculated based on the operations described, even if all `b_i` are `-1`. The current implementation does not account for this, leading to an incorrect result in cases where all `b_i` are `-1`.
