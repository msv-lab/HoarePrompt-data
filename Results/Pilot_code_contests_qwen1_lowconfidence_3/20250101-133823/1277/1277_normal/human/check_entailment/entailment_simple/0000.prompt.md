You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Captain Fint is involved in another treasure hunt, but have found only one strange problem. The problem may be connected to the treasure's location or may not. That's why captain Flint decided to leave the solving the problem to his crew and offered an absurdly high reward: one day off. The problem itself sounds like this...

There are two arrays a and b of length n. Initially, an ans is equal to 0 and the following operation is defined: 

  1. Choose position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n); 
  2. Add a_i to ans; 
  3. If b_i ≠ -1 then add a_i to a_{b_i}. 



What is the maximum ans you can get by performing the operation on each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) exactly once?

Uncle Bogdan is eager to get the reward, so he is asking your help to find the optimal order of positions to perform the operation on them.

Input

The first line contains the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of arrays a and b.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (−10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ n or b_i = -1).

Additional constraint: it's guaranteed that for any i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) the sequence b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, … is not cyclic, in other words it will always end with -1.

Output

In the first line, print the maximum ans you can get.

In the second line, print the order of operations: n different integers p_1, p_2, …, p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n). The p_i is the position which should be chosen at the i-th step. If there are multiple orders, print any of them.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
