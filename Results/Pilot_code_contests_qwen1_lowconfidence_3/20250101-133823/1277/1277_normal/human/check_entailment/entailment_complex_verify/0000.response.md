Final: **True**

Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the given problem. The original assessment stated that the program is correct, and this assessment is validated by the detailed analysis of the annotated code.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The functions `func_1` and `func_6` correctly read the integer `n` and the lists `a` and `b` from the input. These functions handle the input according to the problem constraints and do not introduce any errors.

2. **Processing Logic**:
   - **List `l` Construction**: The program correctly constructs the list `l` to store intermediate results for each element in `a` based on the corresponding `b` value.
   - **Sorting and Calculation**: The program sorts the list `l` along with their corresponding indices and calculates the maximum possible value of `ans` by ensuring that each element is added to `ans` only once and updating the list `a` accordingly.
   - **Order of Operations**: The program constructs the optimal order of operations by sorting the indices based on the contributions and prints the result along with the order.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**: The program handles the constraints specified in the problem, such as the non-cyclic nature of the sequence defined by `b`. The annotated code confirms that the program adheres to these constraints.

4. **Output**: The program correctly prints the maximum possible value of `ans` and the optimal order of operations as required by the problem description.

Given that the annotated version supports the correctness of the program and there are no evident issues or edge cases that the program fails to handle, the original assessment of the program's correctness remains accurate. Therefore, the final assessment is **True**.
