You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Captain Fint is involved in another treasure hunt, but have found only one strange problem. The problem may be connected to the treasure's location or may not. That's why captain Flint decided to leave the solving the problem to his crew and offered an absurdly high reward: one day off. The problem itself sounds like this...

There are two arrays a and b of length n. Initially, an ans is equal to 0 and the following operation is defined: 

  1. Choose position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n); 
  2. Add a_i to ans; 
  3. If b_i ≠ -1 then add a_i to a_{b_i}. 



What is the maximum ans you can get by performing the operation on each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) exactly once?

Uncle Bogdan is eager to get the reward, so he is asking your help to find the optimal order of positions to perform the operation on them.

Input

The first line contains the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of arrays a and b.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (−10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ n or b_i = -1).

Additional constraint: it's guaranteed that for any i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) the sequence b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, … is not cyclic, in other words it will always end with -1.

Output

In the first line, print the maximum ans you can get.

In the second line, print the order of operations: n different integers p_1, p_2, …, p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n). The p_i is the position which should be chosen at the i-th step. If there are multiple orders, print any of them.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible value of `ans` by performing the defined operation on each position exactly once. The program also outputs the optimal order of positions to perform the operations.

Here’s a brief breakdown of how the program works:
1. It initializes `a` and `b` lists from input.
2. It creates a list `l` to keep track of the contributions from each element in `a`.
3. It iterates through each position `i` and updates the contribution to `l[b[i]-1]` if `b[i]` is not `-1`.
4. It sorts the list `l` along with their corresponding indices.
5. It constructs the optimal order by appending the sorted indices to `l2`.
6. It calculates the total `ans` by summing up the contributions and prints the results.

Given the constraints and the logic, the program handles all cases correctly as per the problem description. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that the program fails to handle. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program waits for user input and returns an integer value
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and waits for user input. It then returns the integer value entered by the user. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling. The function simply takes an integer input from the user and returns it.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of n integers where each integer b_i either equals -1 or is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ n.
def func_2():
    return float(input())
    #The program returns a float input from the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` accepts no parameters and prompts the user to input a float value. Upon receiving the input, it returns the float value to the caller. The function does not modify any external variables and relies solely on user input. Potential edge cases include the user entering non-float values, which would result in undefined behavior since the function does not handle such inputs.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies -10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of n integers where each integer is either a positive integer between 1 and n inclusive or -1.
def func_3():
    return input()
    #The program returns an input provided by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not perform any computation or manipulation on the input lists `a` and `b`. Instead, it simply prompts the user to provide an input and returns that input. The function accepts no parameters and relies on external input from the user. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it is important to note that the function does not utilize the input lists `a` and `b` within its body. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned the input provided by the user.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies -10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, b is a list of n integers where each integer is either a positive integer between 1 and n or -1.
def func_4():

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` takes no explicit parameters and expects input from the standard input in the form of a series of integers separated by spaces. It then converts these integers into strings and returns a map object containing these string values. The function does not modify any external variables and solely operates on the input provided through the standard input. Potential edge cases include input formats that do not follow the expected pattern (e.g., non-integer values, multiple spaces between numbers), which would result in unexpected behavior since the function will attempt to convert everything to strings regardless of the input type.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies −10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of n integers where each b_i is either a positive integer such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ n or -1, and the sequence b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, … is not cyclic and ends with -1 for all i.
def func_5():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object of integers split from input, where each integer comes from the input split by spaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5()` reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input and returns a map object containing those integers. The input line is expected to contain exactly as many integers as specified by the variable `n`, which should be provided as part of the initial program state (though it is not defined within the function). The function does not modify any external state and relies on user input to provide the data it processes. No error handling is included for invalid input or cases where the input format differs from expectations. Potential edge cases include input lines with fewer or more integers than specified by `n`, non-integer values, or empty input.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies -10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of n integers where each integer is either a positive integer between 1 and n or -1. It is also guaranteed that for any index i, the sequence b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, … ends with -1.
def func_6():

    #The program returns the result of `func_5()` which processes the lists `a` and `b` as described in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` takes no parameters directly and returns the result of calling `func_5()`. The function `func_5` processes two lists, `a` and `b`, where `a` is a list of integers ranging from -10^6 to 10^6 and `b` is a list of integers that are either a positive integer between 1 and n or -1. The sequence defined by the elements of `b` eventually leads to -1. After processing, the function returns a list produced by `func_5()`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the sequences defined by `b` do not terminate correctly or where the values in `a` and `b` are at their extreme ranges. If `func_5` fails to handle these edge cases, they should be noted in the postcondition.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies −10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of n integers where each integer is either a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ b_i ≤ n or -1. It is also guaranteed that for any i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) the sequence b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, … ends with -1.
def func_7():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7()` opens two files, `input.txt` for reading and `output.txt` for writing, but does not perform any operations on the input parameters `n`, `a`, or `b`. As a result, the function does not process the lists `a` and `b` according to their specified properties. Instead, it simply sets up file streams for input and output without utilizing these inputs in any way. The function leaves the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` unchanged and does not produce any output in `output.txt`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the file streams are opened, but no further processing of `a` and `b` occurs.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers, and y is not zero (y != 0).
def func_8(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y, and y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts two integers `x` and `y` (with `y` not being zero). It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `x` with `y` and `y` with `x % y` until `y` becomes zero. At the end of the function, it returns `x` as the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and sets `y` to 0. Potential edge cases include when `x` or `y` is negative; however, the function does not handle these cases, so the GCD computation may not be as expected in such scenarios. The function does not handle the case where both `x` and `y` are zero, which would result in an undefined behavior since `y` cannot be zero at the start.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers.
def func_9(x, y):
    return x * y // func_8(x, y)
    #The program returns the integer result of x multiplied by y, then performing integer division by the result of calling the function func_8 with arguments x and y
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes the integer result of `x * y` and then performs integer division of this result by the outcome of calling another function `func_8` with the same arguments `x` and `y`. The function returns the final computed value. 

Potential edge cases include:
- If `func_8(x, y)` returns zero, the function will attempt to perform an integer division by zero, which would raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. Therefore, the function should handle such cases appropriately, either by checking if `func_8(x, y)` is non-zero before performing the division or by handling the exception.

No missing functionality is apparent from the provided code snippet.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is an integer such that 1 < b < 10^6 and gcd(b, m) = 1 (where gcd is the greatest common divisor), and m is an integer such that m > 1.

    g = func_8(b, m)
    if (g != 1) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    else :
        return pow(b, m - 2, m)
        #The program returns pow(b, m - 2, m), where `b` is an integer such that \(1 < b < 10^6\) and \(\gcd(b, m) = 1\), and `m` is an integer such that \(m > 1\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts two parameters `b` and `m`. It first calls another function `func_8(b, m)` to compute some value `g`. If `g` is not equal to 1, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function returns `pow(b, m - 2, m)`. The function ensures that `b` is an integer such that \(1 < b < 10^6\) and \(\gcd(b, m) = 1\), and `m` is an integer such that \(m > 1\). The final state of the program after the function concludes is one of the following:
- If `g` is not equal to 1, the program returns -1.
- If `g` is equal to 1, the program returns `pow(b, m - 2, m)`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `b` is not an integer such that \(1 < b < 10^6\) and \(\gcd(b, m) = 1\), or if `m` is not an integer such that \(m > 1\), the function may behave unpredictably due to the assumptions made in the annotations and the conditions checked in the code. However, the function itself does not handle these cases directly.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing an element from array a, b is an integer representing an element from array b, and m is a positive integer representing the modulus.
def func_11(a, b, m):
    a = a % m
    inv = func_10(b, m)
    if (inv == -1) :
        return -999999999
        #The program returns -999999999
    else :
        return inv * a % m
        #`inv * a` modulo `m`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `m`. `a` is an integer representing an element from array `a`, `b` is an integer representing an element from array `b`, and `m` is a positive integer representing the modulus. 

The function first computes the value of `a` modulo `m`. It then calls another function `func_10` with parameters `b` and `m` to find the modular inverse of `b` modulo `m`. If the modular inverse does not exist (i.e., `func_10(b, m)` returns `-1`), the function returns `-999999999`. Otherwise, it returns the product of the modular inverse of `b` and `a`, all taken modulo `m`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes will be one of two states:
- If the modular inverse of `b` modulo `m` does not exist, the program state will have the value `-999999999`.
- If the modular inverse of `b` modulo `m` exists, the program state will have the value `(inv * a) % m`, where `inv` is the modular inverse of `b` modulo `m`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts no explicit parameters but relies on values derived from `func_1()` and `func_6()`. It processes two lists, `a` and `b`, both of length `n`. After performing several operations, it returns two results: the first is the sum of elements in list `a` at indices specified by positive values in `b` (denoted as `ans`), and the second is a transformed list `l2` where each element is an index adjusted by adding 1. The function achieves this through a series of loops and updates to the lists `l`, `l1`, and `a`. Edge cases include scenarios where `b` might contain `-1` or where `b` might not have any positive values, which do not affect the final outcome.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a variable-length argument list containing integers representing the values of array `a`, and kwargs is a dictionary containing keyword arguments where `sep` is a string used to separate the values when printed, `file` is the output stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), `end` is a string appended after the last value (defaulting to a newline), and `flush` is a boolean indicating whether the output stream is to be flushed.
def func_13():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` must contain at least one integer, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing keyword arguments, `sep` is the original value of `kwargs['sep']` or a space `' '`, `file` is the original value of `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout`, `file` contains the string representation of all integers in `args` separated by `sep`, and `at_start` is `False`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` must contain at least one integer, `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'`, `sep` is the original value of `kwargs['sep']` or a space `' '`, `file` contains the string representation of all integers in `args` separated by `sep`, `at_start` is `False`, and `kwargs` has had its `'flush'` key (with a default value of `False`) popped, resulting in either the removal of the key or its value being `None`.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a variable-length argument list `args` containing integers and a dictionary `kwargs` containing optional keyword arguments `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush`. It prints the integers from `args` separated by the `sep` string, followed by the `end` string, and flushes the output stream based on the `flush` value. After executing, the function ensures that the output stream contains the string representation of all integers in `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `end`. If `args` is empty, no output is generated. The function removes the `'sep'`, `'file'`, `'end'`, and `'flush'` keys from `kwargs` after processing. Edge cases include when `args` is empty or when `kwargs` does not contain the expected keys. If `kwargs` lacks the `'sep'` key, the default separator is a space `' '`. If `kwargs` lacks the `'file'` key, the default output stream is `sys.stdout`. If `kwargs` lacks the `'end'` key, the default end character is a newline `'\n'`. If `kwargs` lacks the `'flush'` key, the output stream is not flushed.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
