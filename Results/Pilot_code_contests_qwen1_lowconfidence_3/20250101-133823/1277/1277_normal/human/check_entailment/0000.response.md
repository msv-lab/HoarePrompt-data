Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible value of `ans` by performing the defined operation on each position exactly once. The program also outputs the optimal order of positions to perform the operations.

Hereâ€™s a brief breakdown of how the program works:
1. It initializes `a` and `b` lists from input.
2. It creates a list `l` to keep track of the contributions from each element in `a`.
3. It iterates through each position `i` and updates the contribution to `l[b[i]-1]` if `b[i]` is not `-1`.
4. It sorts the list `l` along with their corresponding indices.
5. It constructs the optimal order by appending the sorted indices to `l2`.
6. It calculates the total `ans` by summing up the contributions and prints the results.

Given the constraints and the logic, the program handles all cases correctly as per the problem description. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that the program fails to handle. Therefore, the program is correct.
