Final: **True**

### Reasoning:

Based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment of the program's correctness appears to be accurate. Let's summarize the key points:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values for `n`, array `a`, and array `b` as specified.
2. **Logic Implementation**: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically:
   - It initializes an array `l` to store the cumulative sums of values that can be added during the operation.
   - It iterates through the array `b` to update the cumulative sums in `l`.
   - It sorts the array `l` to process the indices in such a way that it maximizes the sum `ans`.
   - It calculates the maximum possible value of `ans` and the order of operations.
3. **Output Generation**: The program prints the maximum possible value of `ans` and the order of operations as required.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the program adheres to the problem description and correctly processes the input according to the specified rules. The logic implemented in the `func_12` function ensures that the operation is performed in an optimal order, and the output is generated as expected.

Since the program correctly implements the logic and produces the expected output without any logical errors or inconsistencies, the original assessment of correctness (`True`) is accurate.
