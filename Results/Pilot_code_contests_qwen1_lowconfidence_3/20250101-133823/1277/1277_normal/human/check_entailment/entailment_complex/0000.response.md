Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle the case where there are no positive values in the `b` array. According to the problem description and the annotations, the sequence `b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, ...` is guaranteed to end with `-1`, meaning that `b` should always contain at least one positive value. However, the code does not account for the scenario where `b` contains only `-1` values. In such a case, the code would still attempt to perform operations, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
1
-1
```

The correct output should be:

```
1
1 
```

However, the current implementation will result in an incorrect output because it does not handle the scenario where `b` contains only `-1` values. This violates the requirement that the program should work for every potential case described in the problem statement.
