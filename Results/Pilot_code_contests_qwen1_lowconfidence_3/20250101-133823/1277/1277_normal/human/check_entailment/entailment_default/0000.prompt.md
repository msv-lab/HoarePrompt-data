You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Captain Fint is involved in another treasure hunt, but have found only one strange problem. The problem may be connected to the treasure's location or may not. That's why captain Flint decided to leave the solving the problem to his crew and offered an absurdly high reward: one day off. The problem itself sounds like this...

There are two arrays a and b of length n. Initially, an ans is equal to 0 and the following operation is defined: 

  1. Choose position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n); 
  2. Add a_i to ans; 
  3. If b_i ≠ -1 then add a_i to a_{b_i}. 



What is the maximum ans you can get by performing the operation on each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) exactly once?

Uncle Bogdan is eager to get the reward, so he is asking your help to find the optimal order of positions to perform the operation on them.

Input

The first line contains the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of arrays a and b.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (−10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ n or b_i = -1).

Additional constraint: it's guaranteed that for any i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) the sequence b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, … is not cyclic, in other words it will always end with -1.

Output

In the first line, print the maximum ans you can get.

In the second line, print the order of operations: n different integers p_1, p_2, …, p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n). The p_i is the position which should be chosen at the i-th step. If there are multiple orders, print any of them.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts no parameters and waits for user input. It then returns the integer value entered by the user. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling. The function simply takes an integer input from the user and returns it.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return float(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2()` accepts no parameters and prompts the user to input a float value. Upon receiving the input, it returns the float value to the caller. The function does not modify any external variables and relies solely on user input. Potential edge cases include the user entering non-float values, which would result in undefined behavior since the function does not handle such inputs.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function does not perform any computation or manipulation on the input lists `a` and `b`. Instead, it simply prompts the user to provide an input and returns that input. The function accepts no parameters and relies on external input from the user. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it is important to note that the function does not utilize the input lists `a` and `b` within its body. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned the input provided by the user.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4()` takes no explicit parameters and expects input from the standard input in the form of a series of integers separated by spaces. It then converts these integers into strings and returns a map object containing these string values. The function does not modify any external variables and solely operates on the input provided through the standard input. Potential edge cases include input formats that do not follow the expected pattern (e.g., non-integer values, multiple spaces between numbers), which would result in unexpected behavior since the function will attempt to convert everything to strings regardless of the input type.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return map(int, input().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5()` reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input and returns a map object containing those integers. The input line is expected to contain exactly as many integers as specified by the variable `n`, which should be provided as part of the initial program state (though it is not defined within the function). The function does not modify any external state and relies on user input to provide the data it processes. No error handling is included for invalid input or cases where the input format differs from expectations. Potential edge cases include input lines with fewer or more integers than specified by `n`, non-integer values, or empty input.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return list(func_5())
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` takes no parameters directly and returns the result of calling `func_5()`. The function `func_5` processes two lists, `a` and `b`, where `a` is a list of integers ranging from -10^6 to 10^6 and `b` is a list of integers that are either a positive integer between 1 and n or -1. The sequence defined by the elements of `b` eventually leads to -1. After processing, the function returns a list produced by `func_5()`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the sequences defined by `b` do not terminate correctly or where the values in `a` and `b` are at their extreme ranges. If `func_5` fails to handle these edge cases, they should be noted in the postcondition.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7()` opens two files, `input.txt` for reading and `output.txt` for writing, but does not perform any operations on the input parameters `n`, `a`, or `b`. As a result, the function does not process the lists `a` and `b` according to their specified properties. Instead, it simply sets up file streams for input and output without utilizing these inputs in any way. The function leaves the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` unchanged and does not produce any output in `output.txt`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the file streams are opened, but no further processing of `a` and `b` occurs.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts two integers `x` and `y` (with `y` not being zero). It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `x` with `y` and `y` with `x % y` until `y` becomes zero. At the end of the function, it returns `x` as the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and sets `y` to 0. Potential edge cases include when `x` or `y` is negative; however, the function does not handle these cases, so the GCD computation may not be as expected in such scenarios. The function does not handle the case where both `x` and `y` are zero, which would result in an undefined behavior since `y` cannot be zero at the start.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(x, y):
    return x * y // func_8(x, y)
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes the integer result of `x * y` and then performs integer division of this result by the outcome of calling another function `func_8` with the same arguments `x` and `y`. The function returns the final computed value. 

Potential edge cases include:
- If `func_8(x, y)` returns zero, the function will attempt to perform an integer division by zero, which would raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. Therefore, the function should handle such cases appropriately, either by checking if `func_8(x, y)` is non-zero before performing the division or by handling the exception.

No missing functionality is apparent from the provided code snippet.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(b, m):
    g = func_8(b, m)
    if g != 1:
        return -1
    else:
        return pow(b, m - 2, m)
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts two parameters `b` and `m`. It first calls another function `func_8(b, m)` to compute some value `g`. If `g` is not equal to 1, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function returns `pow(b, m - 2, m)`. The function ensures that `b` is an integer such that \(1 < b < 10^6\) and \(\gcd(b, m) = 1\), and `m` is an integer such that \(m > 1\). The final state of the program after the function concludes is one of the following:
- If `g` is not equal to 1, the program returns -1.
- If `g` is equal to 1, the program returns `pow(b, m - 2, m)`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `b` is not an integer such that \(1 < b < 10^6\) and \(\gcd(b, m) = 1\), or if `m` is not an integer such that \(m > 1\), the function may behave unpredictably due to the assumptions made in the annotations and the conditions checked in the code. However, the function itself does not handle these cases directly.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(a, b, m):
    a = a % m
    inv = func_10(b, m)
    if inv == -1:
        return -999999999
    else:
        return inv * a % m
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `m`. `a` is an integer representing an element from array `a`, `b` is an integer representing an element from array `b`, and `m` is a positive integer representing the modulus. 

The function first computes the value of `a` modulo `m`. It then calls another function `func_10` with parameters `b` and `m` to find the modular inverse of `b` modulo `m`. If the modular inverse does not exist (i.e., `func_10(b, m)` returns `-1`), the function returns `-999999999`. Otherwise, it returns the product of the modular inverse of `b` and `a`, all taken modulo `m`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes will be one of two states:
- If the modular inverse of `b` modulo `m` does not exist, the program state will have the value `-999999999`.
- If the modular inverse of `b` modulo `m` exists, the program state will have the value `(inv * a) % m`, where `inv` is the modular inverse of `b` modulo `m`.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12():
    n = func_1()
    a = func_6()
    b = func_6()
    l = [0] * n

        a[l1[i][1]] += l1[i][0]
    func_13(ans)
    func_13(*l2)
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts no explicit parameters but relies on values derived from `func_1()` and `func_6()`. It processes two lists, `a` and `b`, both of length `n`. After performing several operations, it returns two results: the first is the sum of elements in list `a` at indices specified by positive values in `b` (denoted as `ans`), and the second is a transformed list `l2` where each element is an index adjusted by adding 1. The function achieves this through a series of loops and updates to the lists `l`, `l1`, and `a`. Edge cases include scenarios where `b` might contain `-1` or where `b` might not have any positive values, which do not affect the final outcome.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(*args, **kwargs):

    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  This function takes a variable-length argument list `args` containing integers and a dictionary `kwargs` containing optional keyword arguments `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush`. It prints the integers from `args` separated by the `sep` string, followed by the `end` string, and flushes the output stream based on the `flush` value. After executing, the function ensures that the output stream contains the string representation of all integers in `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `end`. If `args` is empty, no output is generated. The function removes the `'sep'`, `'file'`, `'end'`, and `'flush'` keys from `kwargs` after processing. Edge cases include when `args` is empty or when `kwargs` does not contain the expected keys. If `kwargs` lacks the `'sep'` key, the default separator is a space `' '`. If `kwargs` lacks the `'file'` key, the default output stream is `sys.stdout`. If `kwargs` lacks the `'end'` key, the default end character is a newline `'\n'`. If `kwargs` lacks the `'flush'` key, the output stream is not flushed.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
