Final: **True**

Reasoning:
Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible value of `ans` by performing the defined operation on each position exactly once. The program also outputs the optimal order of positions to perform the operations.

1. The program reads the input values for `n`, `a`, and `b` as expected.
2. It initializes the list `l` to keep track of the contributions from each element in `a`.
3. It iterates through each position `i` and updates the contribution to `l[b[i]-1]` if `b[i]` is not `-1`.
4. It sorts the list `l` along with their corresponding indices.
5. It constructs the optimal order by appending the sorted indices to `l2`.
6. It calculates the total `ans` by summing up the contributions and prints the results using `func_13`.

The output hints confirm that `func_13` handles the printing of integers in the expected manner, and there are no indications from the hints that the program is failing to handle any edge cases or produce incorrect outputs. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
