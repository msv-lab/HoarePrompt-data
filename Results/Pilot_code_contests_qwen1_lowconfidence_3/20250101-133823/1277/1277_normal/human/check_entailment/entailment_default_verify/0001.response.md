Final: **True**

### Reasoning:
1. **Problem Description and Requirements**: The problem involves finding the maximum value of `ans` by performing operations on elements of arrays `a` and `b` according to specified rules. The provided program correctly implements these rules.
2. **Program Functionality**: The program reads the input values for `n`, array `a`, and array `b`. It then processes the arrays to compute the maximum `ans` and the optimal order of operations. The logic used to update `l` and sort it ensures that the values are added in a manner that maximizes `ans`.
3. **Output Hints**: The function `func_13` handles the printing of the results as described. It correctly formats the output with the required separators and end characters, ensuring that the output matches the expected format.
4. **Original Assessment**: The original assessment marked the program as correct (`True`). This assessment aligns with the problem description and the provided code. The program handles all necessary cases and produces the correct output based on the given constraints.

Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness, maintaining the original assessment is justified. Therefore, the final assessment remains `True`.
