Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program handles the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input values for `n`, array `a`, and array `b`.
2. **Initialization**: It initializes an array `l` to store the cumulative sums of values that can be added during the operation.
3. **Processing**: For each position `i` where `b[i]` is not `-1`, it adds `a[i]` to `a[b[i]-1]`. This ensures that the values are added in the correct order according to the rules.
4. **Sorting**: It sorts the array `l` to process the indices in such a way that it maximizes the sum `ans`.
5. **Output**: It prints the maximum possible value of `ans` and the order of operations.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly handles all potential cases as per the problem description. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail. Therefore, the program is correct.
