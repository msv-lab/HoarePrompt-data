The function `func_9` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes the integer result of `x * y` and then performs integer division of this result by the outcome of calling another function `func_8` with the same arguments `x` and `y`. The function returns the final computed value. 

Potential edge cases include:
- If `func_8(x, y)` returns zero, the function will attempt to perform an integer division by zero, which would raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. Therefore, the function should handle such cases appropriately, either by checking if `func_8(x, y)` is non-zero before performing the division or by handling the exception.

No missing functionality is apparent from the provided code snippet.
