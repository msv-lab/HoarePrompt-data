The function `func_12` accepts no explicit parameters but relies on values derived from `func_1()` and `func_6()`. It processes two lists, `a` and `b`, both of length `n`. After performing several operations, it returns two results: the first is the sum of elements in list `a` at indices specified by positive values in `b` (denoted as `ans`), and the second is a transformed list `l2` where each element is an index adjusted by adding 1. The function achieves this through a series of loops and updates to the lists `l`, `l1`, and `a`. Edge cases include scenarios where `b` might contain `-1` or where `b` might not have any positive values, which do not affect the final outcome.
