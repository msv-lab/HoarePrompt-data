The code snippet `ans += a[l1[i][1]]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `a[l1[i][1]]` to the current value of `ans`. Given the initial conditions:

- `l1` is sorted based on the first element of each sublist.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `ans` is 0.
- `l2` contains `[l1[i][1] + 1]`.
- The current value of `b[l1[i][1]]` is greater than 0.

Since `ans` is initially 0, adding `a[l1[i][1]]` to `ans` will set `ans` to `a[l1[i][1]]`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:
- `ans` is now `a[l1[i][1]]`.
- `l1`, `l`, `i`, `n`, `l2`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l1` is sorted based on the first element of each sublist, `l` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is `a[l1[i][1]]`, `l2` contains `[l1[i][1] + 1]`, and the current value of `b[l1[i][1]]` is greater than 0**
