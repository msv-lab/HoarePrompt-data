The function `func_12` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies -10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
- `b` is a list of `n` integers where each integer either equals -1 or is an integer such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ n.

Case_1: The function returns a specific value or result based on the lists `a` and `b` following the given constraints.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_12` is to accept parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` and return a specific value or result based on the conditions provided by the lists `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`. It returns a specific value or result based on the lists `a` and `b` following the given constraints.**
