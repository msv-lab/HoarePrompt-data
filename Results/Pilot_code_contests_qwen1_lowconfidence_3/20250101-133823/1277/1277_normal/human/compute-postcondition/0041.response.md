The code `a[l1[i][1]] += l1[i][0]` increments the value of `a[l1[i][1]]` by `l1[i][0]`. Let's break down the impact:

1. The value of `a[l1[i][1]]` is updated to `a[l1[i][1]] + l1[i][0]`.
2. The values of `l1`, `l`, `i`, `n`, `ans`, and `l2` remain unchanged from their previous states.

Given the initial conditions:
- `l1` is sorted based on the first element of each sublist.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `ans` is calculated based on certain conditions.
- `l2` contains `[l1[i][1], l1[i][1], l1[i][1] + 1]`.

The only change is in `a[l1[i][1]]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`l1` is sorted based on the first element of each sublist, `l` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is `2 * (original_value_of_a[l1[i][1]] + l1[i][0])` if `b[l1[i][1]] > 0` is true and equals the previous value of `ans` plus `a[l1[i][1]]`, otherwise `ans` remains as the previous value, and `l2` contains `[l1[i][1], l1[i][1], l1[i][1] + 1]; `a[l1[i][1]]` is updated to `a[l1[i][1]] + l1[i][0]`**.
