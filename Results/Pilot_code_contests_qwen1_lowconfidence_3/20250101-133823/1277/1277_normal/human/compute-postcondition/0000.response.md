Output State: **args is a variable-length argument list containing integers representing the values of array `a`, and kwargs is a dictionary containing keyword arguments where `sep` is a string used to separate the values when printed, `file` is the output stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), `end` is a string appended after the last value (defaulting to a newline), and `flush` is a boolean indicating whether the output stream is to be flushed. The code does not affect the variables, it only describes the action of printing the values.**
