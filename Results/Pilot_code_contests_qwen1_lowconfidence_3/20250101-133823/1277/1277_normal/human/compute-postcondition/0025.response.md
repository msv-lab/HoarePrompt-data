Functionality: **This function takes a variable-length argument list `args` containing integers and a dictionary `kwargs` containing optional keyword arguments `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush`. It prints the integers from `args` separated by the `sep` string, followed by the `end` string, and flushes the output stream based on the `flush` value. After executing, the function ensures that the output stream contains the string representation of all integers in `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `end`. If `args` is empty, no output is generated. The function removes the `'sep'`, `'file'`, `'end'`, and `'flush'` keys from `kwargs` after processing. Edge cases include when `args` is empty or when `kwargs` does not contain the expected keys. If `kwargs` lacks the `'sep'` key, the default separator is a space `' '`. If `kwargs` lacks the `'file'` key, the default output stream is `sys.stdout`. If `kwargs` lacks the `'end'` key, the default end character is a newline `'\n'`. If `kwargs` lacks the `'flush'` key, the output stream is not flushed.**

Note: The provided code does not handle the case where `args` is empty, which could result in no output being generated. This should be mentioned as a potential edge case.
