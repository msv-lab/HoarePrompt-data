`file` is written with the string representation of `x`. The value of `file` is updated to include `str(x)`. The other variables (`args`, `kwargs`, `sep`, `at_start`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one integer, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing keyword arguments, `sep` is a string used to separate the values when printed, `file` has the value of `str(x)` written to it, and `at_start` is `False`.**
