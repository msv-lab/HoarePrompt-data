The function `func_13` accepts two parameters: `args`, which is a variable-length argument list containing integers, and `kwargs`, which is a dictionary. The dictionary contains keyword arguments where:
- `sep` is a string used to separate the values when printed,
- `file` is the output stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`),
- `end` is a string appended after the last value (defaulting to a newline),
- `flush` is a boolean indicating whether the output stream is to be flushed.

Since there is no explicit return statement provided in the problem description, it can be inferred that the function does not return any value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_13` is to accept a variable-length argument list of integers and a dictionary of keyword arguments, and print the integers separated by the `sep` string, followed by the `end` string, and flush the output stream based on the `flush` value.

Functionality: **The function accepts `args`, a variable-length argument list of integers, and `kwargs`, a dictionary containing `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` as keyword arguments. It prints the integers from `args` separated by the `sep` string, followed by the `end` string, and flushes the output stream based on the `flush` value.**
