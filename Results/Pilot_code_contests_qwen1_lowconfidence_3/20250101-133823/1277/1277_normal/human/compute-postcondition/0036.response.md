The code snippet increments the value of `a[l1[i][1]]` by `l1[i][0]`. Based on the initial state:

- `l1` is sorted based on the first element of each sublist.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `i` is unchanged.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `ans` is either `2 * a[l1[i][1]]` or 0 depending on whether `b[l1[i][1]] > 0` is true.
- `l2` contains `[l1[i][1] + 1, l1[i][1] + 1]`.

After executing the line `a[l1[i][1]] += l1[i][0]`, the value of `a[l1[i][1]]` is updated to its original value plus `l1[i][0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l1` is sorted based on the first element of each sublist, `l` remains unchanged, `i` is `i`, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is either `2 * (original_value_of_a[l1[i][1]] + l1[i][0])` or 0 depending on whether `b[l1[i][1]] > 0` is true, and `l2` contains `[l1[i][1] + 1, l1[i][1] + 1]`**
