`ans` is incremented by `a[l1[i][1]]`. The value of `ans` was previously `a[l1[i][1]]` (or 0 if the condition `b[l1[i][1]] > 0` is false). After the operation, `ans` will be `2 * a[l1[i][1]]` (or 0 if the condition `b[l1[i][1]] > 0` is false). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l1` is sorted based on the first element of each sublist, `l` remains unchanged, `i` is `i`, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is `2 * a[l1[i][1]]` (or 0 if the condition `b[l1[i][1]] > 0` is false), and `l2` contains `[l1[i][1] + 1, l1[i][1] + 1]`**
