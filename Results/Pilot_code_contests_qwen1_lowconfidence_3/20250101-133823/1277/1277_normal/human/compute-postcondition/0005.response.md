The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file specified by `file`. Since `file` defaults to `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`, and `sep` is either the original value of `kwargs['sep']` or a space `' '`, the output will be written to `sys.stdout`. 

The state of `args` is not affected. The state of `kwargs` is also not directly affected in terms of its structure, but `sep` might now be written to the output stream.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one integer, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing keyword arguments where `sep` is a string used to separate the values when printed, `file` is the output stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), `sep` is either the original value of `kwargs['sep']` or a space `' '`, `file` is either the original value of `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `sep` has been written to `sys.stdout`**
