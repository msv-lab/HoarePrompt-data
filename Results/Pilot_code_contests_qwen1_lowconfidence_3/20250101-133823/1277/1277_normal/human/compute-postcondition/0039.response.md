The code snippet adds `a[l1[i][1]]` to `ans`. This impacts the value of `ans`. The value of `ans` was previously either `2 * (original_value_of_a[l1[i][1]] + l1[i][0])` or 0 depending on whether `b[l1[i][1]] > 0` is true. After adding `a[l1[i][1]]`, the new value of `ans` will be the previous value of `ans` plus `a[l1[i][1]]`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `l1` is sorted based on the first element of each sublist.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `l2` contains `[l1[i][1], l1[i][1], l1[i][1] + 1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`l1` is sorted based on the first element of each sublist, `l` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `a[l1[i][1]]`, `l2` contains `[l1[i][1], l1[i][1], l1[i][1] + 1]`**
