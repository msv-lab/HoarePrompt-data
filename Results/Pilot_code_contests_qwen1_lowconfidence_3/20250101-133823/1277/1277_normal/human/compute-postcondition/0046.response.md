Functionality: **The function `func_12` accepts no explicit parameters but relies on values derived from `func_1()` and `func_6()`. It processes two lists, `a` and `b`, both of length `n`. After performing several operations, it returns two results: the first is the sum of elements in list `a` at indices specified by positive values in `b` (denoted as `ans`), and the second is a transformed list `l2` where each element is an index adjusted by adding 1. The function achieves this through a series of loops and updates to the lists `l`, `l1`, and `a`. Edge cases include scenarios where `b` might contain `-1` or where `b` might not have any positive values, which do not affect the final outcome.**

**Specifically, the function does the following:**
1. Initializes an array `l` of size `n` filled with zeros.
2. For each index `i` in `b` where `b[i]` is positive, it increments `l[b[i]-1]` by the corresponding value in `a`.
3. Creates a new list `l1` consisting of pairs `[l[j], j]` for each `j` in the range of `n`.
4. Sorts `l1` based on the first element of each pair.
5. Iterates over `l1`, updating `a` and accumulating the sum `ans` for indices where `b` has a positive value.
6. Constructs `l2` by adding 1 to each element of the sorted indices from `l1`.

This process ensures that the function manipulates and derives meaningful outputs from the input lists `a` and `b`, adhering to the specified constraints.
