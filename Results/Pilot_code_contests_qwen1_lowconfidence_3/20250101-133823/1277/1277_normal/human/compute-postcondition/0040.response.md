Postcondition: **`l1` is sorted based on the first element of each sublist, `l` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is `2 * (original_value_of_a[l1[i][1]] + l1[i][0])` if `b[l1[i][1]] > 0` is true and equals the previous value of `ans` plus `a[l1[i][1]]`, otherwise `ans` remains as the previous value, and `l2` contains `[l1[i][1], l1[i][1], l1[i][1] + 1]`**
