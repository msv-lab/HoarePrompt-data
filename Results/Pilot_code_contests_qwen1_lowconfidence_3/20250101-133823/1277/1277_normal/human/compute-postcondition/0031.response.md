The code updates the value of `a[l1[i][1]]` by adding `l1[i][0]` to it. Let's break down the impact:

- `a[l1[i][1]]` is updated to `a[l1[i][1]] + l1[i][0]`.
- `i` is decremented by 1 since it is not re-assigned in the code snippet, so `i` becomes `i - 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged because it is not referenced or modified in the code snippet.
- `ans` remains unchanged because `ans` was calculated before this line of code and does not depend on `l1[i][0]` or `l1[i][1]` directly.
- `l1` remains unchanged because it is not referenced or modified in the code snippet.
- `l` remains unchanged because it is not referenced or modified in the code snippet.
- `l2` remains unchanged because it is not referenced or modified in the code snippet.

Given these points, the updated states are:

- `a[l1[i][1]]` is updated to its original value plus `l1[i][0]`.
- `i` is now `i - 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`l1` is sorted based on the first element of each sublist, `l` remains unchanged, `i` is `i - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is `a[l1[i][1]]` (or 0 if the condition `b[l1[i][1]] > 0` is false), and `l2` contains `[l1[i][1] + 1]`. `a[l1[i][1]]` is updated to its original value plus `l1[i][0]`.**
