The code appends `l1[i][1] + 1` to `l2`. The previous value of `l2` is `[l1[i][1], l1[i][1]]`. After appending, the new value of `l2` becomes `[l1[i][1], l1[i][1], l1[i][1] + 1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l1` is sorted based on the first element of each sublist, `l` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is either `2 * (original_value_of_a[l1[i][1]] + l1[i][0])` or 0 depending on whether `b[l1[i][1]] > 0` is true, `l2` contains `[l1[i][1], l1[i][1], l1[i][1] + 1]`**
