The function `func_13(ans)` is called with `ans` as an argument. This function does not return any value and its implementation is not provided, so it does not change the state of any variables. The only impact is that `ans` is passed to `func_13`.

Output State: **`l1` is sorted based on the first element of each sublist, `l` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `ans` is passed to `func_13`, and `l2` contains the list `[l1[0][1] + 1, l1[1][1] + 1, ..., l1[n-1][1] + 1]`. `a[l1[i][1]]` is updated to `a[l1[i][1]] + l1[i][0]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.**
