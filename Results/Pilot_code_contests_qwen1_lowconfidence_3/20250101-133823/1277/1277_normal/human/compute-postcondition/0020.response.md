The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` has the following impacts:

1. It removes the key-value pair associated with the key `'end'` from the dictionary `kwargs` using `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`. If `'end'` is not present in `kwargs`, it uses the default value `'\n'`.
2. It writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` (which is `'\n'` in this case) to the file object referenced by `file`.

Given the initial state, `file` contains the string representation of all integers in `args` separated by `sep`, and `at_start` is `False`. The value of `kwargs['sep']` is `sep`, and the value of `kwargs['file']` is `file`.

After executing the code, the state of the variables is updated as follows:
- `kwargs` now does not contain the key `'end'`.
- `file` remains unchanged and still contains the string representation of all integers in `args` separated by `sep`.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one integer, `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'`, `sep` is the original value of `kwargs['sep']` or a space `' '`, `file` contains the string representation of all integers in `args` separated by `sep`, and `at_start` is `False`.**
