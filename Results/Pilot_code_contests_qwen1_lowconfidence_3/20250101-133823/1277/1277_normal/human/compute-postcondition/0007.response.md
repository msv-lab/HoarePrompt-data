The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file specified by `file`. Since `file` is typically `sys.stdout` (the standard output stream) and `sep` has already been written to `sys.stdout` (implying `at_start` was `False`), this operation will write `str(x)` to `sys.stdout`.

Given the initial state:
- `args` must contain at least one integer.
- `kwargs` is a dictionary containing keyword arguments.
- `sep` is a string used to separate the values when printed, originally either `kwargs['sep']` or a space `' '`.
- `file` is the output stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), originally either `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout`.
- `sep` has been written to `sys.stdout`.

After executing `file.write(str(x))`, `x` is converted to a string and written to `sys.stdout`. Therefore, `sep` will no longer be written because `file.write` is writing the string directly.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one integer, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing keyword arguments, `sep` is a string used to separate the values when printed, `file` is the output stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), `sep` has been written to `sys.stdout`, `x` is converted to a string and written to `sys.stdout`.**
