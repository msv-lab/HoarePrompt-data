Let's analyze the given loop and deduce the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.

### Initial State Recap:
- `l1` is sorted based on the first element of each sublist.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `i` starts at `n-1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `ans` is 0.
- `l2` is an empty list.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(n):
    l2.append(l1[i][1] + 1)
    if b[l1[i][1]] > 0:
        ans += a[l1[i][1]]
    a[l1[i][1]] += l1[i][0]
```

### Analysis:

1. **Iteration Process**:
   - In each iteration, `i` increases by 1.
   - `l2` appends `l1[i][1] + 1`.
   - If `b[l1[i][1]] > 0`, then `ans` is incremented by `a[l1[i][1]]`.
   - `a[l1[i][1]]` is updated by adding `l1[i][0]`.

2. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop completes all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`.
   - `l2` will contain the list `[l1[0][1] + 1, l1[1][1] + 1, ..., l1[n-1][1] + 1]`.
   - `ans` will be the sum of `a[l1[i][1]]` for all valid indices where `b[l1[i][1]] > 0`.
   - `a[l1[i][1]]` will be updated to `a[l1[i][1]] + l1[i][0]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

### Output State:

- `l1` remains sorted based on the first element of each sublist.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `i` will be `n-1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `ans` will be the sum of `a[l1[i][1]]` for all valid indices where `b[l1[i][1]] > 0`.
- `l2` will contain the list `[l1[0][1] + 1, l1[1][1] + 1, ..., l1[n-1][1] + 1]`.
- `a[l1[i][1]]` will be updated to `a[l1[i][1]] + l1[i][0]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

### Conclusion:

Output State: **`l1` is sorted based on the first element of each sublist, `l` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `ans` is the sum of `a[l1[i][1]]` for all valid indices where `b[l1[i][1]] > 0`, and `l2` contains the list `[l1[0][1] + 1, l1[1][1] + 1, ..., l1[n-1][1] + 1]`. `a[l1[i][1]]` is updated to `a[l1[i][1]] + l1[i][0]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.**
