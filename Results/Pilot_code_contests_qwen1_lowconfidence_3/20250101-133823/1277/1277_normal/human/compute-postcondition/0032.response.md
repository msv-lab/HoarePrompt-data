Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `l1` is sorted based on the first element of each sublist.
   - `l` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is `i - 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `ans` is `a[l1[i][1]]` (or 0 if the condition `b[l1[i][1]] > 0` is false).
   - `l2` contains `[l1[i][1] + 1]`.
   - `a[l1[i][1]]` is updated to its original value plus `l1[i][0]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i` to `n-1`.

3. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` should become `i`.

4. **Other States to Adjust:**
   - Since `l` remains unchanged, `l` stays the same.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - `l2` should contain `[l1[i][1] + 1]`.
   - `a[l1[i][1]]` is updated to its original value plus `l1[i][0]`, but this update is done within the loop, so the value of `a[l1[i][1]]` will be updated accordingly in the next iteration.

5. **Condition for `ans`:**
   - The value of `ans` is determined by the condition `b[l1[i][1]] > 0`. If this condition is true, then `ans` is set to `a[l1[i][1]]`. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.
   - Since `i` is being incremented, we need to check the new value of `i` to determine the new `l1[i][1]` and thus the new value of `ans`.

Putting it all together:

- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `n` must still be greater than 1.
- `l2` should contain `[l1[i][1] + 1]`.
- `a[l1[i][1]]` will be updated to its original value plus `l1[i][0]` in the next iteration.
- The condition for `ans` will depend on the new value of `i`.

State: **`l1` is sorted based on the first element of each sublist, `l` remains unchanged, `i` is `i`, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is `a[l1[i][1]]` (or 0 if the condition `b[l1[i][1]] > 0` is false), and `l2` contains `[l1[i][1] + 1]`**.
