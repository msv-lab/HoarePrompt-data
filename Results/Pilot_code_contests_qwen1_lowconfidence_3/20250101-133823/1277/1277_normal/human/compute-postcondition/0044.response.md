The function `func_13(*l2)` is called with the unpacked elements of `l2`. Since `l2` is defined as `[l1[0][1] + 1, l1[1][1] + 1, ..., l1[n-1][1] + 1]`, and no further operations are performed on `l2` within the given code snippet, `l2` remains unchanged. The function call itself does not modify any variables outside of `l2`.

Therefore, the only changes occur in the array `a`, where for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `a[l1[i][1]]` is updated to `a[l1[i][1]] + l1[i][0]`. This means each element of `a` at the position specified by the second element of each sublist in `l1` is incremented by the first element of the corresponding sublist.

Output State: **`l1` is sorted based on the first element of each sublist, `l` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `ans` is passed to `func_13`, `l2` contains the list `[l1[0][1] + 1, l1[1][1] + 1, ..., l1[n-1][1] + 1]`, and for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `a[l1[i][1]]` is updated to `a[l1[i][1]] + l1[i][0]`.**
