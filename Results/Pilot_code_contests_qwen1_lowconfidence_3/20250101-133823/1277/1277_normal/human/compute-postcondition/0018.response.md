The variable `at_start` is explicitly set to `False`. No other changes are made to the variables in this code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one integer, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing keyword arguments, `sep` is a string used to separate the values when printed, `file` has the value of `str(x)` written to it, and `at_start` is `False`.**
