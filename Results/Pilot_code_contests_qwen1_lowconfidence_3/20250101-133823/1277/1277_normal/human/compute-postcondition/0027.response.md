`l2` appends the value of `l1[i][1] + 1` to itself. Given that `i` is `n-1` and `n` is greater than 1, `i` must be at least 0. However, since `l1` is sorted based on the first element of each sublist, the exact value of `l1[i][1]` depends on the content of `l1`. Since no specific values for `l1` are given, we can only state that `l2` now contains the value of `l1[i][1] + 1` appended to it.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l1` is sorted based on the first element of each sublist, `l` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is 0, `l2` contains `[l1[i][1] + 1]`**
