n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies −10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of n integers where each b_i is either a positive integer such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ n or -1, and the sequence b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, … is not cyclic and ends with -1 for all i.
