n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies -10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of n integers where each integer is either a positive integer between 1 and n or -1. It is also guaranteed that for any index i, the sequence b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, … ends with -1.
