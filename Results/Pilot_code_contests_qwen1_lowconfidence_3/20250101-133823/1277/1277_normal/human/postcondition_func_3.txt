The function `func_4()` takes no explicit parameters and expects input from the standard input in the form of a series of integers separated by spaces. It then converts these integers into strings and returns a map object containing these string values. The function does not modify any external variables and solely operates on the input provided through the standard input. Potential edge cases include input formats that do not follow the expected pattern (e.g., non-integer values, multiple spaces between numbers), which would result in unexpected behavior since the function will attempt to convert everything to strings regardless of the input type.
