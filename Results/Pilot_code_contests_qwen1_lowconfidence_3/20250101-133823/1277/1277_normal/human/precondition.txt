The input consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), representing the length of arrays a and b. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (−10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ n or b_i = -1), with the additional constraint that for any i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) the sequence b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, … is not cyclic and will always end with -1.
