The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers from the standard input. It then sorts the list of integers and calculates a value `r` based on a specific formula involving powers of 2 and the sorted list. Finally, it prints `-r`. The function ensures that the input list contains distinct integers within the specified range and handles the calculation modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Potential edge cases include the minimum and maximum values of `n` and the constraints on the input integers.
