Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the value of `r` does not match the definition of \(F(a)\) as described in the problem statement. The code calculates the sum of differences between the smallest and largest elements in each subset, but it should be calculating the maximum distance between any two elements in each subset.

To illustrate, consider the second example given:

- Input: `3 4 3 1`
- Expected output: `9`

However, the code will produce an incorrect result. The correct implementation would involve iterating over all possible non-empty subsets of the hacked computers and calculating the maximum distance for each subset, then summing these values modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The provided code instead uses a different approach that does not correctly compute the required sum. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
