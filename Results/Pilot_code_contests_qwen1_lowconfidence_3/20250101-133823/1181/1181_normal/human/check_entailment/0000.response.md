Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the calculation of \( F(a) \) for all non-empty subsets \( a \) of the set of hacked computers. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the sum of \( F(a) \) values.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the maximum distance between pairs of computers for each subset and sum these maximum distances. The provided solution attempts to simplify this by using powers of 2 and coordinate values, but it does not accurately capture the required calculation.

For instance, consider the input:
```
3
4 3 1
```

The expected output is 9, as explained in the problem statement. However, the program fails to correctly compute this value. Instead of iterating through all possible subsets and calculating the maximum distance within each subset, the program uses a different approach that does not account for the subset sums properly.

A correct implementation would involve generating all subsets and calculating the maximum distance for each subset, which is computationally expensive for large \( n \). However, the provided solution does not follow this approach and thus does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
