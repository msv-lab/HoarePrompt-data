Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the required sum. Specifically, the formula used to compute the sum is incorrect. The program attempts to calculate the sum using a different approach than the one described in the problem statement.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the contribution of each pair of computers to the sum. For each computer \(i\), its contribution to the sum depends on how many subsets it is part of and the maximum distance it forms with other computers in those subsets.

The correct approach involves calculating the sum of the maximum distances for all possible non-empty subsets. This can be done efficiently using the properties of binomial coefficients and the fact that each pair of computers contributes to multiple subsets.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
    mod = 1000000007
    r = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        left = 0
        right = 0
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            right += s[j] - s[i]
            r += (s[j] - s[i]) * (2 ** (j - i - 1) * (2 ** (n - j - 1) + 2 ** (n - i - 1) - 2)) % mod
            r %= mod
        for j in range(i):
            left += s[i] - s[j]
            r += (s[i] - s[j]) * (2 ** (i - j - 1) * (2 ** (n - i - 1) + 2 ** (n - j - 1) - 2)) % mod
            r %= mod
    
    print(r)

func()
```

This corrected program correctly calculates the required sum by considering the contribution of each pair of computers and their distances in all possible subsets.
