The function `func` accepts a parameter `x`, which is a list of integers. The length of the list `n` satisfies the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, and each integer `xi` in the list is distinct and satisfies the condition 1 ≤ xi ≤ 10^9. 

There is no specific return value mentioned in the provided information, only the conditions under which the function operates.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list `x` of integers where the length of the list `n` is between 1 and 3·10^5, and each integer `xi` in the list is distinct and between 1 and 10^9.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `x`, which is a list of integers where the length of the list `n` is between 1 and 3·10^5, and each integer `xi` in the list is distinct and between 1 and 10^9.**
