The code `s = sorted(map(int, raw_input().split()))` has the following impacts:

1. It takes a string input from the user using `raw_input()`.
2. The string is split into individual elements using `.split()`.
3. Each element in the resulting list is converted to an integer using `map(int, ...)` (note: `map(int, ...)` applies `int` to each element of the list).
4. The list of integers is sorted using `sorted(...)`, and the sorted list is assigned to `s`.

Since the initial state of `n` is an integer input and `x` is not yet defined, after executing the code:

- `n` retains its initial state as an integer input.
- `x` remains undefined.
- `s` is defined as the sorted list of integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `x` is undefined, `s` is a sorted list of integers from the input**
