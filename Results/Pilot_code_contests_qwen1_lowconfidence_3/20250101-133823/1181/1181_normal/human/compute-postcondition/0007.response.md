Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than `i` + 1
   - `x` is undefined
   - `s` is a sorted list of integers from the input
   - `r` is updated to `r + s[0] * (2**i)`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for each `i` in `range(n)`.

3. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - The value of `i` will increment by 1 for each iteration.
   - The condition `n > i + 1` must still hold true at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since `x` is undefined, it remains unchanged.
   - `s` is a sorted list of integers and does not change within the loop.
   - `r` accumulates the values based on the current `i`.

4. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was some value, say `k`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will become `k + 1`.
   - To satisfy the condition `n > i + 1`, we need `n > k + 2`.

Therefore, the new states at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` will be `k + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than `k + 2`.
- `x` remains undefined.
- `s` remains a sorted list of integers from the input.
- `r` will be updated to `r + s[0] * (2**(k + 1))`.

Given the initial condition, if `i` was `0` at the start of the first iteration, then after the first iteration, `i` will be `1`, and `n` must be greater than `2`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`n` must be greater than `i` + 2, `x` is undefined, `s` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `r` is updated to `r + s[0] * (2**(i + 1))**`.
