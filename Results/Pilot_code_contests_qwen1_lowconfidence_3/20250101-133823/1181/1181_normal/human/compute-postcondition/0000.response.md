The code reads an integer from input and assigns it to the variable `n`. However, since no input is provided in the initial state and no input is given in the problem, the value of `n` remains unknown, and the list `x` is not initialized. Therefore, the only change is that `n` is assigned the value of an integer input, but the exact value of `n` is not specified.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input, and the list `x` is not yet defined**
