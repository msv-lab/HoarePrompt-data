Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers from the standard input. It then sorts the list of integers and calculates a value `r` based on a specific formula involving powers of 2 and the sorted list. Finally, it prints `-r`. The function ensures that the input list contains distinct integers within the specified range and handles the calculation modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Potential edge cases include the minimum and maximum values of `n` and the constraints on the input integers.**

**Specifically, the function performs the following actions:**
1. Reads an integer `n` from the standard input, ensuring \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
2. Reads a list of `n` integers from the standard input, ensuring each integer is distinct and \(1 \leq xi \leq 10^9\).
3. Sorts the list of integers.
4. Computes `r` using the formula \(r = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s[i] \cdot (2^{(n-1-i)} - 1 - (2^i - 1)) \mod (10^9 + 7)\), where `s` is the sorted list.
5. Prints `-r`.

**Note:** The annotation mentions that `x` is a parameter, but the function does not accept any parameters. Instead, it directly reads input from the standard input. Additionally, the annotation incorrectly states that `x` is a parameter; the function should focus on the actual input and output behavior described in the code.
