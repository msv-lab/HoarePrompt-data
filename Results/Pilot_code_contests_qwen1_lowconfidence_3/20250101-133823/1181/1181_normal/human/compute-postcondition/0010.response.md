The code snippet given is:
```python
print(-r)
```
Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `x` is undefined.
- `s` is a sorted list of integers from the input.
- `r` is the sum of `s[i] * 2` for each element in the list `s`.

Let's analyze the impact of the code on the program:

1. The variable `r` is already defined and contains the sum of `s[i] * 2` for each element in the list `s`.
2. The code simply prints `-r` which is the negation of the value of `r`.

Since `r` is defined as the sum of `s[i] * 2` for each element in the list `s`, printing `-r` will negate this sum.

Therefore, the only change is the output of the print statement, but no new variables are assigned or modified.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is undefined, `s` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `r` is the sum of `s[i] * 2`, the output is `-r`**
