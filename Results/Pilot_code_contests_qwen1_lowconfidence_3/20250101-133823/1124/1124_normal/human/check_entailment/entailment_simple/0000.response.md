Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the key aspects to confirm the correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input values `n` and `m` correctly.
   - It then reads the coordinates of the banned cells and stores them in the list `ban`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two lists `r` and `c` of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `1`. These lists represent the availability of cells along the rows and columns, respectively.
   - For each banned cell `(x, y)`, it sets the corresponding elements in `r` and `c` to `0` to mark those cells as unavailable.

3. **Counting Available Cells:**
   - The program iterates over the possible starting positions for the chips (non-corner border cells) and counts the available cells. The loop runs from `2` to `2 + (n - 2) // 2` because the corners are excluded.
   - For each position `i`, it checks the availability of cells in the same row (`r[i]` and `r[n - i + 1]`) and the same column (`c[i]` and `c[n - i + 1]`).

4. **Handling Odd-Sized Fields:**
   - If the field size `n` is odd, the program checks the middle row and column to ensure no banned cells are in the middle. If either the middle row or column is still available, it adds 1 to the count of available cells.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the total count of available cells, which represents the maximum number of chips Gerald can place without violating the game rules.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately follows the problem description by correctly identifying and counting the available border cells while ensuring no banned cells are hit during the movement of chips. It handles both even and odd-sized fields appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
