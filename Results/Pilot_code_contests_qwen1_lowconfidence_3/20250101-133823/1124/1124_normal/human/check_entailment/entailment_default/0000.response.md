Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the game rules as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code calculates the number of valid paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of an \( n \times n \) grid, avoiding banned cells, but it does not simulate the movement of chips or ensure that no chips fall on banned cells, overlap, or swap positions during the game.

The problem requires moving chips from one border to the opposite border without violating the given conditions. The code instead focuses on counting the number of valid paths from one corner to the opposite corner, which is not equivalent to simulating the chip movement as described. Thus, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
