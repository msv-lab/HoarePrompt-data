Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where a banned cell is on the border but not at a corner. According to the problem description, Gerald can place chips on border cells (not corners), but the program incorrectly sets the border cells to 0 if they are banned, which prevents placing any chips on those cells.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 1
3 2
```

In this case, the banned cell is (3, 2), which is a border cell. The program should allow placing a chip on either (1, 2) or (3, 4) or (4, 2) since they are not corner cells. However, the program will set `c[2]` to 0 because it considers the entire column, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program needs to handle border cells more carefully, ensuring that only corner cells are excluded from placement. Hereâ€™s a modified version of the program that addresses this issue:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    (n, m) = rints()
    ban = [rints() for _ in range(m)]
    r = [1] * (n + 1)
    c = [1] * (n + 1)
    
    for (x, y) in ban:
        if 1 < x < n and 1 < y < n:
            continue
        if 1 < x < n:
            c[y] = 0
        if 1 < y < n:
            r[x] = 0
    
    for i in range(2, 2 + (n - 2) // 2):
        ans += sum([r[i], r[n - i + 1], c[i], c[n - i + 1]])
    if n % 2 and (r[(n + 1) // 2] or c[(n + 1) // 2]):
        ans += 1
    print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that only corner cells are excluded from placement, allowing the program to handle the described cases correctly.
