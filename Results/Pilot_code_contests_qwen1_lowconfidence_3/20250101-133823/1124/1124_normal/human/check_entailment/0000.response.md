Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the banned cells are on the borders in such a way that it incorrectly counts the number of valid positions for placing chips. Specifically, the program assumes that all cells from index 2 to \(n-1\) on each border can be used, which is not always true if banned cells are present.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 1
2 2
```
In this case, the field is a 3x3 grid, and the cell (2, 2) is banned. According to the problem description, Gerald can place chips only on the border cells (excluding corners). However, the program incorrectly counts all cells from index 2 to \(n-1\) on each border as valid, leading to an incorrect result.

The correct approach would be to explicitly check if the cells on each border are banned and adjust the count accordingly. The provided solution does not do this, making it incorrect.
