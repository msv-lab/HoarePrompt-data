The function accepts an n x n grid configuration with constraints on the range of n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and m (0 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), along with a list of banned cells (xi, yi) such that 1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n. It then calculates the number of valid paths from the top-left corner (1, 1) to the bottom-right corner (n, n) while avoiding all banned cells. The function returns the total count of such valid paths. If n is odd, it also checks the central cell (n+1)//2 for either row or column to ensure there is no ban there.
