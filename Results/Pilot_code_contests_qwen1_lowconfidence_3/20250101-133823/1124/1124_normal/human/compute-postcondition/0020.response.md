The code `print(ans)` prints the value of `ans` but does not change the value of `ans` itself. Therefore, the value of `ans` remains the same as it was before the print statement. The states of the other variables (`r` and `c`) are unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is the sum of `r[i] + r[n - i + 1] + c[i] + c[n - i + 1]` for all valid `i` in the range `2` to `2 + (n - 2) // 2`, plus 1 if `n` is an odd number and either the middle element of `r` or the middle element of `c` is non-zero; `r` and `c` remain unchanged.**
