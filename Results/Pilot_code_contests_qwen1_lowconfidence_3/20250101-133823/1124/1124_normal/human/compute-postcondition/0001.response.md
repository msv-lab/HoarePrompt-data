`n, m` are assigned the values from the list returned by the function `rints()`. The values of these variables are now specific integers, but their exact values depend on the input provided when calling `rints()`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, the subsequent m lines each contain two integers `xi` and `yi` such that 1 ≤ `xi`, `yi` ≤ `n`, and the variables `n` and `m` are assigned values from the list returned by `rints()`**.
