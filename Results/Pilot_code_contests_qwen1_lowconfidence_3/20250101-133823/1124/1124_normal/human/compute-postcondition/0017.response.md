Postcondition: ***`ans` is equal to the sum of `r[i] + r[n - i + 1] + c[i] + c[n - i + 1]` for all valid `i` in the range `2` to `2 + (n - 2) // 2`, `r` and `c` remain unchanged, where `i` is within the specified range. `n` is an odd number, and either the middle element of `r` or the middle element of `c` is non-zero.***
