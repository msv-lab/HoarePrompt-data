Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `ans` is increased by the sum of `r[i]`, `r[n - i + 1]`, `c[i]`, and `c[n - i + 1]`.
  - `r` and `c` remain unchanged.

### Loop Structure:
```
for i in range(2, 2 + (n - 2) // 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` values from `2` to `2 + (n - 2) // 2`.
   - The loop starts with `i = 2`.
   - It increments `i` until `i` is less than `2 + (n - 2) // 2`.

2. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans` has been updated.
   - `r` and `c` remain unchanged.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must satisfy the loop condition.
   - Let's assume `i` was at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`.

4. **Determine `i_end`**:
   - If `i` was at the end of the previous iteration, it means `i` was just below the upper limit of the loop.
   - If `i` was at the upper limit, the next value would be `i_end + 1`.
   - We need to find `i_end` such that `i_end + 1` satisfies the loop condition.

5. **Upper Limit Calculation**:
   - The upper limit of the loop is `2 + (n - 2) // 2`.
   - If `i` was at the end of the previous iteration, then `i_end + 1` should be equal to `2 + (n - 2) // 2`.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - `ans` will be updated in the next iteration.
   - `r` and `c` will remain unchanged.

### Conclusion:
If `i` was at the end of the previous iteration, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to the upper limit of the loop, which is `2 + (n - 2) // 2 - 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `ans` will be updated based on the new `i`.
- `r` and `c` will remain unchanged.

The exact value of `i` at the start of the next iteration is `2 + (n - 2) // 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`ans` is increased by the sum of `r[2 + (n - 2) // 2]`, `r[n - (2 + (n - 2) // 2) + 1]`, `c[2 + (n - 2) // 2]`, and `c[n - (2 + (n - 2) // 2) + 1]`, `r` and `c` remain unchanged.**
