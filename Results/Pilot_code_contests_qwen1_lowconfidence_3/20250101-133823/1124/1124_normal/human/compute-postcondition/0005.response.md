To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will iterate. The loop iterates over pairs `(x, y)` from the `ban` list. 

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 1000\).
   - `m` is an integer such that \(0 < m \leq 10^5\).
   - `ban` is a list of `m` lists, each containing 4 integers.
   - `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with `1`, except `r[x]` which is `0`.
   - `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with `1`, except `c[y]` which is `0`.
   - `ans` is `0`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each pair `(x, y)` in the `ban` list.

3. **Determine When the Loop Can Execute Again:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another pair `(x, y)` left in the `ban` list to be processed.
   - Since `ban` is a list of pairs, the loop will continue as long as `ban` is not empty.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - After processing each pair `(x, y)`, the `ban` list should have one fewer pair.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the `ban` list should have one less pair than it had at the end of the previous iteration.

### Updated States at the Start of the Next Iteration:

- `n` remains the same since it does not change within the loop.
- `m` remains the same since it does not change within the loop.
- `ban` now contains one fewer pair than before.
- `r` and `c` remain unchanged since they are not modified by the loop itself.
- `ans` remains `0` since the loop only processes pairs without modifying this variable.

### Final Answer:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 1000\), `m` is an integer such that \(0 < m \leq 10^5\), `ban` is a list of \(m - 1\) lists each containing 4 integers, `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with `1`, except `r[x]` which is `0`, `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with `1`, except `c[y]` which is `0`, and `ans` is `0`.**
