The code `r[x], c[y] = 0, 0` updates the values of `r[x]` and `c[y]` to `0`. The initial values of `r` and `c` are specified such that they contain `1`s everywhere except at indices `x` and `y`, where they are `0`. After executing this line of code, `r[x]` and `c[y]` are explicitly set to `0`, while the rest of the elements in `r` and `c` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `r` remains a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `1`, except `r[x]` and `r[y]` which are both `0`.
- `c` remains a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `1`, except `c[x]` and `c[y]` which are both `0`.

The values of `n`, `m`, `ban`, and `ans` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 1000\); `m` is an integer such that \(1 < m \leq 10^5\); `ban` is a list of \(m - 1\) lists each containing 4 integers; `r` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `1`, except `r[x]` and `r[y]` which are both `0`; `c` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `1`, except `c[x]` and `c[y]` which are both `0`; `ans` is `0`.**
