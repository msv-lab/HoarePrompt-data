The code `r[x], c[y] = 0, 0` updates the values of `r[x]` and `c[y]` to `0`. The values of `n`, `m`, `ban`, `r`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 0 < m ≤ 10^5, `ban` is a list of `m` lists each containing 4 integers, `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with `1`, except `r[x]` which is `0`, `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with `1`, except `c[y]` which is `0`, and `ans` is `0`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 0 < m ≤ 10^5, `ban` is a list of `m` lists each containing 4 integers, `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with `1`, except `r[x]` which is `0`, `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with `1`, except `c[y]` which is `0`, and `ans` is `0`.**
