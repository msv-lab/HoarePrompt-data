The provided code snippet updates the variable `ans` by adding the sum of four elements: `r[i]`, `r[n - i + 1]`, `c[i]`, and `c[n - i + 1]`. However, the initial values of these variables (`r`, `c`, and `ans`) are not specified. Without specific values, we can only describe the impact on the variables.

Let's break it down:

1. `ans += sum([r[i], r[n - i + 1], c[i], c[n - i + 1]])`: This line adds the sum of `r[i]`, `r[n - i + 1]`, `c[i]`, and `c[n - i + 1]` to `ans`.

Given the initial state without specific values, the output state will reflect the addition of the sum to `ans`. The other variables (`r` and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is increased by the sum of `r[i]`, `r[n - i + 1]`, `c[i]`, and `c[n - i + 1]`; `r` and `c` remain unchanged.**
