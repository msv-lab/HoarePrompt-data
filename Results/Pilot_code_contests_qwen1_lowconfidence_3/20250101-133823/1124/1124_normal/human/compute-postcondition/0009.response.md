Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 1000\); `m` is an integer such that \(0 < m \leq 10^5\); `ban` is a list of `m` lists each containing 4 integers; `r` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `1`, except for positions `x` and `y` which are both `0`; `c` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `1`, except for positions `x` and `y` which are both `0`; `ans` is `0`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each pair `(x, y)` in `ban` and sets `r[x]` and `r[y]` to `0`.
- Similarly, it sets `c[x]` and `c[y]` to `0`.
- Since `ban` contains `m` pairs, the loop will execute exactly `m` times.
- After all iterations, `r` and `c` will have `0` at positions `x` and `y` for each `(x, y)` in `ban`, and all other elements will remain `1`.
- The value of `ans` remains `0` throughout the loop since no operations are performed on `ans` within the loop.

This final state holds regardless of the number of iterations, as long as the loop runs exactly `m` times, which is determined by the length of `ban`.
