The code provided is a lambda function that reads multiple integers from standard input and returns them as a list. However, this function does not assign the result to any variable, it only defines the function. Therefore, the variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the banned cells remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and the subsequent m lines each contain two integers `xi` and `yi` such that 1 ≤ `xi`, `yi` ≤ `n`, representing the coordinates of banned cells. A lambda function `rints` is defined to read integers from standard input and return them as a list.**
