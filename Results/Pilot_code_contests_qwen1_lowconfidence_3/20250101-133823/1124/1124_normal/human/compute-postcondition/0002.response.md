The code initializes four variables: `ban`, `r`, `c`, and `ans`. 

- `ban` is assigned a list comprehension that creates a list of length `m`, where each element is a list of 4 integers generated by `rints()`. Since `rints()` is not specified, we assume it returns a list of 4 integers. Therefore, `ban` will be a list of `m` lists, each containing 4 integers.
- `r` and `c` are initialized as lists of length `n + 1` filled with the integer `1`.
- `ans` is initialized to `0`.

Given the initial conditions, the only changes are in the values of `ban`, `r`, and `c`. `ans` remains `0`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `ban` is a list of `m` lists each containing 4 integers, `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with `1`, `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with `1`, and `ans` is `0`.**
