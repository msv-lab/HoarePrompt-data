The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it processes the input constraints and relationships provided. The function checks if a path exists from cell (1, 1) to cell (n, n) on an n x n grid, where certain cells are banned and cannot be traversed. The functionality of the function is to determine if there is a valid path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid, avoiding the specified banned cells.

Functionality: **The function accepts an n x n grid configuration with constraints on the range of n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), m (0 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), and specific banned cells (xi, yi) such that 1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n, and returns whether there is a valid path from (1, 1) to (n, n) avoiding all banned cells.**
