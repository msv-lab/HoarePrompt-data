The code `r[x], c[y] = 0, 0` changes the values of `r[x]` and `c[y]` from their previous values to `0`. The values of `n`, `m`, `ban`, `r`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

- Initially, `r` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `1`, except `r[x]` which is `0`.
- After executing the code, `r[x]` remains `0` and `r[y]` also becomes `0`.
- Similarly, initially, `c` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `1`, except `c[y]` which is `0`.
- After executing the code, `c[y]` remains `0` and `c[x]` also becomes `0`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `r` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `1`, except `r[x]` and `r[y]` which are both `0`.
- `c` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `1`, except `c[x]` and `c[y]` which are both `0`.

The Output State is: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 1000\); `m` is an integer such that \(0 < m \leq 10^5\); `ban` is a list of \(m - 1\) lists each containing 4 integers; `r` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `1`, except `r[x]` and `r[y]` which are both `0`; `c` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `1`, except `c[x]` and `c[y]` which are both `0`; `ans` is `0`.**
