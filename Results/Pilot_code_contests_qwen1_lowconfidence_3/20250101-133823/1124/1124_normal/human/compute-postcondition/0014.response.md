Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration
- `ans` is increased by the sum of `r[(n // 2) + 1]`, `r[(n // 2)]`, `c[(n // 2) + 1]`, and `c[(n // 2)]`.
- `r` and `c` remain unchanged.

### For Loop Statement
```python
for i in range(2, 2 + (n - 2) // 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop starts with `i = 2` and increments `i` until it reaches `2 + (n - 2) // 2`.
2. **Range Calculation**: The upper limit of the loop is `2 + (n - 2) // 2`.
   - This means if `n` is even, the loop runs from `2` to `n // 2`.
   - If `n` is odd, the loop runs from `2` to `(n - 1) // 2`.

3. **What Happens in Each Iteration**:
   - In each iteration, `ans` is updated by adding values from arrays `r` and `c`.

4. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `ans` has been updated.
   - `r` and `c` have not changed.
   - The current value of `i` is the last `i` used in the loop.

### Next Iteration State
- Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be within the range defined by the loop condition.

### Adjusting the States
- The value of `ans` will be updated again based on the same `r` and `c` arrays.
- `r` and `c` remain unchanged.
- The next value of `i` should be the current value of `i` plus 1, ensuring it stays within the loop range.

### Determining the Next Value of `i`
- If the loop has just finished, the last value of `i` was `2 + (n - 2) // 2 - 1`.
- Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `2 + (n - 2) // 2`.

### Final State
- `ans` will be updated again.
- `r` and `c` remain unchanged.
- `i` will be `2 + (n - 2) // 2`.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration
State: **`ans` is increased by the sum of `r[(n // 2) + 1]`, `r[(n // 2)]`, `c[(n // 2) + 1]`, and `c[(n // 2)]`, `r` and `c` remain unchanged, `i` is `2 + (n - 2) // 2`**
