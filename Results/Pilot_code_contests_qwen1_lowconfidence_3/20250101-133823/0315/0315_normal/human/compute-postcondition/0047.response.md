Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `f` is 1, `i` is 2. If `i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
