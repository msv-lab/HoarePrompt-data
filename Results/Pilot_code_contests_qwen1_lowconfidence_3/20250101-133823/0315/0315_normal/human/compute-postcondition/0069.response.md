The code `break` is used to exit the current loop or block. In this context, it means that the function `func_2(i + 1)` call will be exited, and no further operations within that function will be performed. The values of the variables outside of that function call remain unchanged.

The output state includes the following:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is set to the current value of `n`.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `m` is the maximum value in the updated list `a`.
- `f` is 1.
- The current value of `a[i]` is equal to `m`.
- Either `(i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1])` or `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` is true.
- The function `func_2(i + 1)` call is exited.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is set to the current value of `n`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the updated list `a`, `f` is 1, the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `m`, either `(i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1])` or `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` is true, and the function `func_2(i + 1)` call is exited.**
