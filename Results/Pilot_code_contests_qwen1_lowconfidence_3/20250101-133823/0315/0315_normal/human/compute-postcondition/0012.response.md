`x` is written to `file` using `write`, but since `x` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value. The values of `t`, `sep`, `file`, and `args` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must contain at least one element, `at_start` is `False`, and `x` is written to `file`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must contain at least one element, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is written to `file`**
