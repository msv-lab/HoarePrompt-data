Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, and `args` must contain at least one element. If `at_start` is `False`, the postcondition retains the same values as the precondition. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition's evaluation.***
