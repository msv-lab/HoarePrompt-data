Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `f` is 1, `i` is 4. If `i - 1` is not less than 0 and `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` or if `i + 1` is less than `n` and `a[i]` is greater than `a[i + 1]`, then `i` is set to 4. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
