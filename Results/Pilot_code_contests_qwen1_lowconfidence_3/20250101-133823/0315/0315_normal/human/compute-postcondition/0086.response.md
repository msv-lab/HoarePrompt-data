The function `func_2(-1)` is called with `-1` as an argument. However, the definition of `func_2` is not provided, so we cannot determine what changes this function might make to the variables. Since no specific changes to the variables are described in the given code snippet, we assume that the function does not modify the variables `t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `m`, and `f`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer input by the user, `i` is the index where the condition is met (or the last index if no such index exists), `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the updated list `a`, and `f` is 0.**
