Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `f` is 1 if any element in `a` satisfies the condition `(a[i] == m and (i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1] or i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1]))` during the loop, otherwise `f` is 0, and `i` is the index of the first occurrence of `m` that satisfies the condition if `f` is 1, otherwise `i` is `n`.**
