Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` contains all input arguments, `at_start` is `False`, each element in `args` is written to `file` with `sep` separating them except the first element, `sys.stdout` has written `\n`. The call to `sys.stdout.flush()` is made if the `flush` key in `kwargs` is `True` or if `flush` is not specified in `kwargs`.***
