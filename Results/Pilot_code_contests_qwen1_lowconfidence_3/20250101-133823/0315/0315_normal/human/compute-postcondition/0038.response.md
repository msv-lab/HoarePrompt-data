The function `func_2(i + 1)` is called, which increments `i` by 1. The value of `i` was initially 0, so now `i` is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `f` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `m`. The condition `(i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1] or (i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1]))` is true.**
