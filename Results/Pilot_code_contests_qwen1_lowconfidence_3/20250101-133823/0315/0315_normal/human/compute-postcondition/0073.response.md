The function `func_2(i + 1)` is called with `i + 1`. Given that `i` is currently set to the current value of `n`, `i + 1` would be `n + 1`. However, the value of `i` itself does not change within this context, and the function call does not modify any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `func_2` is called with `n + 1`.

Output State: **t is greater than 0, n must be greater than 0, i is set to the current value of n, a is a list of integers input by the user, m is the maximum value in the updated list a, f is 1, and `func_2` is called with `n + 1`.**
