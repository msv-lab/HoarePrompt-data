The line of code `f = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `f`. The value of `f` was previously 0, and this does not change. All other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `f` is 0, and `i` is 0**
