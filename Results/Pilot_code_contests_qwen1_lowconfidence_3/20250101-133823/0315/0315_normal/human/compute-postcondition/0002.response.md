The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. This initializes the variable `at_start` but does not affect the values of `t`, `sep`, or `file`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `True`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `True`**
