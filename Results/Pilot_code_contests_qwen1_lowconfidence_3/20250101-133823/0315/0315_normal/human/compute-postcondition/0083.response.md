Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `f` is 1. If `i - 1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, or if `i + 1` is less than `n` and `a[i]` is greater than `a[i + 1]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
