`at_start` is assigned the value `False`, which was its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must contain at least one element, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is written to `file`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must contain at least one element, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is written to `file`**
