The code `f = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `f`. This assignment does not affect the values of other variables. Therefore, the only change is that `f` is now `1`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is set to the current value of `n`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the updated list `a`, `f` is `1`, and `func_2` is called with `n + 1`.**
