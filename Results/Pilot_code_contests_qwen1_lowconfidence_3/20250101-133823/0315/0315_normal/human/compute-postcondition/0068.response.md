The code sets `f` to 1. The value of `f` was previously 0, but now it is explicitly set to 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is set to the current value of `n`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the updated list `a`, `f` is 1, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `m`, and either `(i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1])` or `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` is true; `func_2(i + 1)` is called.**
