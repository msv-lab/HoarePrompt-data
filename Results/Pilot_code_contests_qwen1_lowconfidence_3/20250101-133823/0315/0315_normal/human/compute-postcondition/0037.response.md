Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `f` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `m`. The condition `(i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1] or (i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1]))` is true.***
