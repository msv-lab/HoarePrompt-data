The function `func_2(-1)` is called, but the content of the function is not provided. Since the function is not defined, we cannot determine what specific changes it will make to the variables. Therefore, the only variables that are explicitly mentioned and their current states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `f` is 0, and `i` is `n` since the loop did not execute.**
