`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `sys.stdout`. Since `x` is the next element in `args`, and `args` contains at least two elements, `x` is the second element in `args`. The `file` remains `sys.stdout`, `sep` remains `' '`, `at_start` remains `False`, and since `at_start` is `False`, no additional space needs to be written to `sys.stdout`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must contain at least two elements, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the next element in `args`, and a string representation of `x` has been written to `sys.stdout`.**
