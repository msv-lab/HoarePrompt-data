Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must contain at least one element, `at_start` is `False`. Since the condition `not at_start` is true in the if part, the program does not enter the else part and the values of `t`, `sep`, `file`, and `args` remain unchanged.***
