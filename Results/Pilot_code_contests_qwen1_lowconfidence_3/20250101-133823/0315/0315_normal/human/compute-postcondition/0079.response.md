The function `func_2(i + 1)` is called with the argument `i + 1`. Since the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine what changes it might make. However, we know that `i` is initially 0, so the argument passed to `func_2` is `0 + 1`, which is `1`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user
- `m` is the maximum value in the updated list `a`
- `f` is 1

After calling `func_2(1)`, the following variables have been affected:
- `i` has been incremented by 1, so now `i` is 1.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `f`) are not mentioned as being affected by this function call, so they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the updated list `a`, `f` is 1**
