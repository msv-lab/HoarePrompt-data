`func_2(i + 1)` is called with the argument `i + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 2, the argument passed to `func_2` is `2 + 1`, which is `3`. However, the code does not define what happens inside `func_2` or return any value. Therefore, the only change is the argument passed to `func_2`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `f` is 1, `i` is 2, `func_2` is called with the argument 3**
