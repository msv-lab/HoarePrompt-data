Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer input by the user, `i` is the index where the condition is met (or the last index if no such index exists), `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the updated list `a`, and `f` remains 0 unless any index `i` satisfies the condition `(i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1])` or `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` when `a[i]` equals `m`, in which case `f` is set to 1.***
