Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of piranhas (`n`) and their sizes stored in a list (`a`). For each test case, it determines whether any piranha with the maximum size (`m`) is adjacent to another piranha that is smaller than it. If such a piranha is found, the function calls `func_2` with the index of the first such piranha. If no such piranha is found, it calls `func_2` with `-1`. The function does not return anything but performs these checks for all test cases.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If there are no test cases (`t == 0`), the function will still execute the loop but won't process any data, which is a valid scenario.
- If all piranhas in a given test case have the same size (making `m` the only possible value for `a[i]`), the loop will always check if `i-1` or `i+1` is within bounds, but since `a[i]` is always equal to `m`, the condition `a[i] > a[i-1]` or `a[i] > a[i+1]` will never be true unless there is a different piranha size in the list, which contradicts the assumption. Therefore, the code correctly handles this scenario by setting `f` to 0.
- If `a[i]` is the maximum and is adjacent to another piranha that is smaller, `func_2` will be called with the index of that piranha, but the code does not handle the case where there are multiple such indices; it only processes the first one found. This means if there are multiple adjacent smaller piranhas, only the first one will be processed.

Given the above analysis, the function iterates through each test case, identifies the maximum piranha size, and checks if any maximum-sized piranha has an adjacent smaller piranha, then calls `func_2` accordingly.
