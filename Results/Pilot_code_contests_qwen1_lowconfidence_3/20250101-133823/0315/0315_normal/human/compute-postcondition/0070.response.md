Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is set to the current value of `n`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the updated list `a`, `f` is 1, the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `m`, and either `(i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1])` or `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` is true.***

This postcondition encompasses both the if and else parts. Since the else part does not provide any additional information and is essentially absent, the overall postcondition directly reflects the conditions specified in the if part.
