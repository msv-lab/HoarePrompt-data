The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `f`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Since the input from the user is not specified, we cannot determine the exact contents of `a`. However, we know that `a` is now a list of integers, and each element in `a` corresponds to an integer input by the user.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `f` is 0, and `i` is 0**
