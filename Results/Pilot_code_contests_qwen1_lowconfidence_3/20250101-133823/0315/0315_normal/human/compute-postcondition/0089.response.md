The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters. However, based on the provided constraints and the expected behavior from the output cases, we can infer that the function likely takes input through standard input or another external source (e.g., a list of test cases). 

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), representing the number of piranhas in the aquarium.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the sizes of the piranhas, where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(3 \times 10^5\).

The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on some unspecified logic.

From the output cases, we can deduce the following:
- Case_1: The function returns the count of piranhas whose size is less than the average size of all piranhas.
- Case_2: The function returns the count of piranhas whose size is greater than the average size of all piranhas.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process a list of test cases, each containing a list of piranha sizes, and return the count of piranhas whose size is either less than or greater than the average size of all piranhas in the list.

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of test cases `t`, the number of piranhas `n`, and a list `a` of piranha sizes, and returns the count of piranhas whose size is less than the average size and the count of piranhas whose size is greater than the average size.**
