Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the sizes of the piranhas in the aquarium, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `f` is 0, and `i` is 0. Since the condition `f == 0` is true, the program does not enter the if block and thus the values of `f` and `i` remain unchanged.***
