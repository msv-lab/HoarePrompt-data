The function `func_2(i + 1)` is called, where `i` is 3. This means `func_2(4)` is called. However, since the actual implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine what changes, if any, this function call will make to the variables. Therefore, we only know that `i` has been updated to 4 for the purpose of calling `func_2`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `f` is 1, `i` is 4**
