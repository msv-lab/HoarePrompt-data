The code `break` does not change any variable values directly but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code, the only effect is that we break out of any such structure if we were inside one. However, since no loop or switch was mentioned, we assume the code simply exits due to `break`. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `f` is 1, `i` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
