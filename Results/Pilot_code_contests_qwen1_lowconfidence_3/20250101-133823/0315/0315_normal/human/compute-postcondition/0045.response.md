The code `f = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `f`. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `f` is 1, `i` is 2, `func_2` is called with the argument 3**
