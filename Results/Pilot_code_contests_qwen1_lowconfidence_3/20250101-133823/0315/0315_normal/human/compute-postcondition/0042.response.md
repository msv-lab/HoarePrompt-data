Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `f` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and either the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `m` (in which case the loop or conditional statement has been broken) or there is no other condition specified (implying the loop or conditional statement remains unchanged).***
