The function `func_2(i + 1)` is called with the argument `i + 1`. Since the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the changes it will make. However, we know that `i` is currently set to the current value of `n`. After calling `func_2(i + 1)`, the value of `i` remains unchanged because the function call does not modify the value of `i` directly. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `f`) are not affected by this function call.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is set to the current value of `n`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the updated list `a`, `f` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `m`, and either `(i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1])` or `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])` is true; `func_2(i + 1)` is called.**
