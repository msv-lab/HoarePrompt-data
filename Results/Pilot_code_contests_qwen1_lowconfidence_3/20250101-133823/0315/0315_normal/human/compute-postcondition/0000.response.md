Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, each test case consists of `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) positive integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the sizes of piranhas in the aquarium, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5 (∑ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and no variables are updated or assigned new values.**

The provided code snippet is a docstring that explains what the `func_2` function does, but it does not contain any executable code that would alter the state of the variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
