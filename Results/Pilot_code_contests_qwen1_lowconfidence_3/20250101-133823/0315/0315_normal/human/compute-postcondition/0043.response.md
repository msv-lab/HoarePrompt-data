Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `n` is an integer input by the user.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
   - `f` is 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - Either the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `m` (in which case the loop or conditional statement has been broken), or there is no other condition specified (implying the loop or conditional statement remains unchanged).

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

4. **Loop Execution**:
   For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and checked against `n`.

5. **Updated States**:
   - `i` will become 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

6. **Verification**:
   - Since `i` is now 2, it must be less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time.
   - All other values (`t`, `a`, `m`, `f`) remain unchanged as there is no indication that these would change within the loop based on the given information.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.

The final state should be:
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `f` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
