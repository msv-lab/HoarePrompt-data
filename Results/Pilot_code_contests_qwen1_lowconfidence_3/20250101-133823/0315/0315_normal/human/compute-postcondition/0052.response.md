The `break` statement does not modify any variables but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or match-case statement. Since there is no loop or match-case statement in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `f` is 1, `i` is 4**
