The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is ' ') to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). The value of `sep` remains unchanged, and `file` also remains `sys.stdout`. The value of `t` and `args` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must contain at least one element, `at_start` is `False`**
