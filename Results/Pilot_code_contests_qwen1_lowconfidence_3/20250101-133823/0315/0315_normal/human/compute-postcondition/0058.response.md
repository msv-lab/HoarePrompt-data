Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `f` is 0 if the loop did not execute, and `i` is `n`. If the loop executed at least once, `f` is 1 and `i` is the index of the first occurrence of `m` that satisfies the condition. Otherwise, `i` is `n`.***
