The line `at_start = False` assigns the value `False` to the variable `at_start`. The previous value of `at_start` was `False`, which remains unchanged. The other variables (`t`, `sep`, `file`, `args`, `x`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must contain at least two elements, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the next element in `args`.**
