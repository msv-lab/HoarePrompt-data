The function `func_2(-1)` is called with `-1` as an argument, but the definition of `func_2` is not provided. In the absence of the function's definition, we cannot determine what changes, if any, are made to the variables. Therefore, the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `f`, and `i` retain their initial values from the precondition.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of n integers representing the sizes of the piranhas in the aquarium, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `f` is 0, and `i` is 0**
