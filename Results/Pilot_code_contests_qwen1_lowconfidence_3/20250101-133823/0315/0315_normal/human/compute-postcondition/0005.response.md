`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is a space character ' ') to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). This operation does not change the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` must contain at least one element.
