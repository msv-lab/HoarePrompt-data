The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of piranhas (`n`) and their sizes stored in a list (`a`). For each test case, it determines whether any piranha with the maximum size (`m`) is adjacent to another piranha that is smaller than it. If such a piranha is found, the function calls `func_2` with the index of the first such piranha. If no such piranha is found, it calls `func_2` with `-1`. The function does not return anything but performs these checks for all test cases.
