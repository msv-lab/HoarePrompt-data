t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) positive integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the sizes of piranhas in the aquarium. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5 (∑ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5). The function `func_2` is not related to solving the problem and is likely a utility function for printing, which is not used in the provided code snippet.
