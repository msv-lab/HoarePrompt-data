The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. It takes a sequence of arguments (`args`) and writes them to `sys.stdout` separated by a space (`' '`), except for the first element. If the `kwargs` contain an `end` key, it appends its value (defaulting to `\n`) to the output. If the `kwargs` contain a `flush` key set to `True`, it flushes the output buffer of `sys.stdout`. This function can be used to print a list or tuple of values to the standard output with specific formatting options. However, since the function is not called within the provided code snippet, its primary purpose is to demonstrate or test the formatting capabilities for printing.
