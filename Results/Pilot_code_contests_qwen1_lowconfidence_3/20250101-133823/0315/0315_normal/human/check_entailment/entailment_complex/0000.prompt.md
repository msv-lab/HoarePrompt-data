You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n piranhas with sizes a_1, a_2, …, a_n in the aquarium. Piranhas are numbered from left to right in order they live in the aquarium.

Scientists of the Berland State University want to find if there is dominant piranha in the aquarium. The piranha is called dominant if it can eat all the other piranhas in the aquarium (except itself, of course). Other piranhas will do nothing while the dominant piranha will eat them.

Because the aquarium is pretty narrow and long, the piranha can eat only one of the adjacent piranhas during one move. Piranha can do as many moves as it needs (or as it can). More precisely: 

  * The piranha i can eat the piranha i-1 if the piranha i-1 exists and a_{i - 1} < a_i. 
  * The piranha i can eat the piranha i+1 if the piranha i+1 exists and a_{i + 1} < a_i. 



When the piranha i eats some piranha, its size increases by one (a_i becomes a_i + 1).

Your task is to find any dominant piranha in the aquarium or determine if there are no such piranhas.

Note that you have to find any (exactly one) dominant piranha, you don't have to find all of them.

For example, if a = [5, 3, 4, 4, 5], then the third piranha can be dominant. Consider the sequence of its moves: 

  * The piranha eats the second piranha and a becomes [5, \underline{5}, 4, 5] (the underlined piranha is our candidate). 
  * The piranha eats the third piranha and a becomes [5, \underline{6}, 5]. 
  * The piranha eats the first piranha and a becomes [\underline{7}, 5]. 
  * The piranha eats the second piranha and a becomes [\underline{8}]. 



You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of piranhas in the aquarium. The second line of the test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the size of the i-th piranha.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5 (∑ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).

Output

For each test case, print the answer: -1 if there are no dominant piranhas in the aquarium or index of any dominant piranha otherwise. If there are several answers, you can print any.

Example

Input

5 4 3 5 5


Output


3
-1

1

Note

The first test case of the example is described in the problem statement.

In the second test case of the example, there are no dominant piranhas in the aquarium.

In the third test case of the example, the fourth piranha can firstly eat the piranha to the left and the aquarium becomes [4, 4, 5, 4], then it can eat any other piranha in the aquarium.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `f` is 1 if any element in `a` satisfies the condition `(a[i] == m and (i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1] or i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1]))` during the loop, otherwise `f` is 0, and `i` is the index of the first occurrence of `m` that satisfies the condition if `f` is 1, otherwise `i` is `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of piranhas (`n`) and their sizes stored in a list (`a`). For each test case, it determines whether any piranha with the maximum size (`m`) is adjacent to another piranha that is smaller than it. If such a piranha is found, the function calls `func_2` with the index of the first such piranha. If no such piranha is found, it calls `func_2` with `-1`. The function does not return anything but performs these checks for all test cases.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) positive integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the sizes of piranhas in the aquarium. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5 (∑ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5). The function `func_2` is not related to solving the problem and is likely a utility function for printing, which is not used in the provided code snippet.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` contains all input arguments, `at_start` is `False`, each element in `args` is written to `file` with `sep` separating them except the first element.

        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`t` is a positive integer, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` contains all input arguments, `at_start` is `False`, each element in `args` is written to `file` with `sep` separating them except the first element, `sys.stdout` has written `\n`, and if the `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` evaluates to `True`, the buffer of `sys.stdout` is flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. It takes a sequence of arguments (`args`) and writes them to `sys.stdout` separated by a space (`' '`), except for the first element. If the `kwargs` contain an `end` key, it appends its value (defaulting to `\n`) to the output. If the `kwargs` contain a `flush` key set to `True`, it flushes the output buffer of `sys.stdout`. This function can be used to print a list or tuple of values to the standard output with specific formatting options. However, since the function is not called within the provided code snippet, its primary purpose is to demonstrate or test the formatting capabilities for printing.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
