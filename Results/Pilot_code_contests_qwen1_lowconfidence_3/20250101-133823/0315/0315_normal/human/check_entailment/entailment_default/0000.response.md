Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly identify a dominant piranha in all cases. Specifically, the code checks if a piranha with the maximum size is adjacent to a smaller piranha and calls `func_2` with the index of the first such piranha. However, this approach does not guarantee finding a dominant piranha, as it does not account for the possibility that a smaller piranha can grow larger through a series of adjacent piranha interactions.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
5
4 5 4 6 5
```

In this case, the piranha at index 3 (with size 6) cannot immediately eat the piranha at index 2 (with size 4) because it is adjacent to a larger piranha (size 5). However, if the piranha at index 2 can grow larger by eating the piranha at index 1 (with size 4), it can eventually become larger than the piranha at index 3 and thus become dominant. The provided code does not handle this scenario, making it incorrect.
