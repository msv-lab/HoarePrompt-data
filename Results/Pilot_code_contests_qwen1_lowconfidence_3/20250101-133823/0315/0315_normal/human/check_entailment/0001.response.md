Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify dominant piranhas according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if a piranha can eat another piranha based on the current size of the piranha, but it does not simulate the process of the piranha eating and increasing its size over multiple steps. This means it cannot accurately determine if a piranha can eventually dominate all others.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
5 3 4 4 5
```

According to the problem, the third piranha can eventually become dominant. However, the current implementation does not simulate the process of the third piranha growing larger by eating smaller adjacent piranhas. As a result, it incorrectly identifies the third piranha as a potential dominant piranha without simulating the necessary growth process.

Here is a counterexample:
- Input: `5 3 4 4 5`
- Expected output: `3` (since the third piranha can eventually become dominant)
- Actual output: The program might return `-1` because it does not simulate the growth process.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it fails to handle the dynamic growth of the piranha sizes over multiple steps, which is crucial for determining dominance.
