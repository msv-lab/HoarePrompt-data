Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly identify a dominant piranha in all cases. Specifically, the code only checks if a piranha with the maximum size is adjacent to a smaller piranha and calls `func_2` with the index of that piranha or `-1` if no such piranha is found. However, this approach is incomplete because it does not simulate the eating process to ensure that the identified piranha can eventually dominate all others.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
5
5 3 4 4 5
5
4 4 3 4 4
3
1 1 2
```

The code will correctly identify the third piranha in the first and third cases as dominant. However, in the second case, the code will incorrectly identify the fourth piranha as dominant, which is not true. The fourth piranha can eat the third piranha, but then it will face the first and second piranhas, which are equal in size, and cannot eat them without being eaten themselves.

To fix this, the code needs to simulate the eating process to ensure that the identified piranha can eventually become larger than all others. This involves recursively checking if the piranha can continue eating until it dominates all others or determining if it gets stuck in a cycle or a situation where it cannot dominate all others.
