Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify dominant piranhas in all cases. Specifically, it fails to check if a piranha can eventually become dominant by eating smaller piranhas step-by-step.

Consider the following input:
```
5
5 3 4 4 5
```

The expected output is `3` because the third piranha can become dominant as described in the example. However, the provided function does not correctly simulate the process of a piranha eating smaller piranhas step-by-step.

Hereâ€™s why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. The function `func_1` identifies the maximum size piranha but does not check if this piranha can eventually become dominant by eating smaller piranhas.
2. It checks if the maximum size piranha can directly eat its neighbors, but it does not simulate the process of eating smaller piranhas over multiple steps.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to simulate the process of a piranha eating smaller piranhas until it can no longer grow. Hereâ€™s a more appropriate approach:

```python
def is_dominant_piranha(a):
    n = len(a)
    for i in range(n):
        current_max = a[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and a[j] < current_max:
            current_max += 1
            j -= 1
        j = i + 1
        while j < n and a[j] < current_max:
            current_max += 1
            j += 1
        if current_max > max(a):
            return i + 1
    return -1

def dominant_piranha():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(is_dominant_piranha(a))

dominant_piranha()
```

This revised solution correctly simulates the process of a piranha growing by eating smaller piranhas and checks if it can eventually become dominant.
