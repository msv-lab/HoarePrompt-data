Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided Python program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a dominant piranha exists. Specifically, the function `func_1` attempts to find a piranha whose size is the maximum in the list, but it does not simulate the process of the piranha eating and growing larger over multiple steps. The function `func_2` is intended to print the results, but it is never called within the main logic of `func_1`, meaning it does not contribute to solving the problem. Therefore, the program fails to correctly identify dominant piranhas as per the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
