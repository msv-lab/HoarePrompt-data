Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the provided annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the process of a piranha growing by eating smaller piranhas step-by-step. It only checks if the maximum-sized piranha can directly eat its adjacent smaller piranhas, which is insufficient to determine if a piranha can become dominant. The annotated version clearly shows that the function `func_2` is not used in the main logic and is a utility function for printing, which does not affect the core functionality of determining dominance. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is maintained.
