You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are n piranhas with sizes a_1, a_2, …, a_n in the aquarium. Piranhas are numbered from left to right in order they live in the aquarium.

Scientists of the Berland State University want to find if there is dominant piranha in the aquarium. The piranha is called dominant if it can eat all the other piranhas in the aquarium (except itself, of course). Other piranhas will do nothing while the dominant piranha will eat them.

Because the aquarium is pretty narrow and long, the piranha can eat only one of the adjacent piranhas during one move. Piranha can do as many moves as it needs (or as it can). More precisely: 

  * The piranha i can eat the piranha i-1 if the piranha i-1 exists and a_{i - 1} < a_i. 
  * The piranha i can eat the piranha i+1 if the piranha i+1 exists and a_{i + 1} < a_i. 



When the piranha i eats some piranha, its size increases by one (a_i becomes a_i + 1).

Your task is to find any dominant piranha in the aquarium or determine if there are no such piranhas.

Note that you have to find any (exactly one) dominant piranha, you don't have to find all of them.

For example, if a = [5, 3, 4, 4, 5], then the third piranha can be dominant. Consider the sequence of its moves: 

  * The piranha eats the second piranha and a becomes [5, \underline{5}, 4, 5] (the underlined piranha is our candidate). 
  * The piranha eats the third piranha and a becomes [5, \underline{6}, 5]. 
  * The piranha eats the first piranha and a becomes [\underline{7}, 5]. 
  * The piranha eats the second piranha and a becomes [\underline{8}]. 



You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of piranhas in the aquarium. The second line of the test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the size of the i-th piranha.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5 (∑ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).

Output

For each test case, print the answer: -1 if there are no dominant piranhas in the aquarium or index of any dominant piranha otherwise. If there are several answers, you can print any.

Example

Input


6
5
5 3 4 4 5
3
1 1 1
5
4 4 3 4 4
5
5 5 4 3 2
3
1 1 2
5
5 4 3 5 5


Output


3
-1
4
3
3
1

Note

The first test case of the example is described in the problem statement.

In the second test case of the example, there are no dominant piranhas in the aquarium.

In the third test case of the example, the fourth piranha can firstly eat the piranha to the left and the aquarium becomes [4, 4, 5, 4], then it can eat any other piranha in the aquarium.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
