na, ma, nb, mb are positive integers such that 1 ≤ na, ma, nb, mb ≤ 50. The first table is represented as a na x ma 2D list of strings where each string is either "0" or "1". The second table is represented as a nb x mb 2D list of strings where each string is either "0" or "1". Both tables contain at least one "1".
