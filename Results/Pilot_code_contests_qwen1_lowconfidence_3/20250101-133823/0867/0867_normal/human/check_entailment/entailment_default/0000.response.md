Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, there are edge cases where the code might not work as expected:

1. **Handling Negative Shift Values**: The code does not handle the case where `x` is negative. If `i + x` is less than 0, the condition `if i + x in range(0, nb):` will fail, and no action will be taken for those cases. This could lead to ignoring certain parts of the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Zero Shift Value**: The code does not explicitly handle the case when `y` is zero. If `y` is zero, the code still performs unnecessary bit shift operations, which do not change the values. This could be optimized to avoid these operations.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly handle all possible inputs and edge cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
