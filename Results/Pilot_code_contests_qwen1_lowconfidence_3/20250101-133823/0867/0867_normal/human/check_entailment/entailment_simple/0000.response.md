Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given annotated program does not correctly implement the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Table Representation:**
   - The program reads the tables and converts them into integers using base 2 conversion (`int(stdin.readline().strip()[::-1], 2)`), which assumes that the binary representation is read in reverse order. However, this approach does not correctly represent the tables as described in the problem. The problem description states that the tables are read in normal order (rows followed by columns).

2. **Incorrect Shift Calculation:**
   - The function `func_2` is designed to calculate the overlap factor for a given shift (x, y). However, the implementation uses bitwise operations (`<<` and `&`) which do not align with the problem description. Specifically, the problem description requires summing the products of corresponding elements after shifting, which should be done using arithmetic operations rather than bitwise operations.

3. **Incorrect Range Checks:**
   - The program checks for valid ranges using `in range(0, nb)` and `in range(0, mb)`, but it should check the bounds considering the shift (x, y) properly. For example, the condition should be `1 <= i + x <= nb` and `1 <= j + y <= mb`.

4. **Incorrect Return Value:**
   - The function `func_1` performs a series of bitwise operations and returns the result. However, the problem description requires calculating the overlap factor by summing the products of shifted elements, not performing bitwise operations.

### Correct Implementation:
To meet the problem description, the program should:
- Read the tables in their normal binary representation.
- Implement the `func_2` to correctly calculate the overlap factor using arithmetic operations.
- Ensure proper range checks for valid shifts.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

# Read dimensions and tables
(na, ma) = [int(buf) for buf in stdin.readline().strip().split()]
a = [list(map(int, stdin.readline().strip())) for _ in range(na)]
(nb, mb) = [int(buf) for buf in stdin.readline().strip().split()]
b = [list(map(int, stdin.readline().strip())) for _ in range(nb)]

# Initialize the best shift and maximum overlap factor
best_x, best_y, max_overlap = 0, 0, 0

# Iterate over all possible shifts
for x in range(-min(na, nb) + 1, min(nb, na)):
    for y in range(-min(ma, mb) + 1, min(mb, ma)):
        overlap = 0
        # Calculate the overlap for the current shift
        for i in range(na):
            if 1 <= i + x <= nb:
                for j in range(ma):
                    if 1 <= j + y <= mb:
                        overlap += a[i][j] * b[i + x - 1][j + y - 1]
        # Update the best shift if the current overlap is higher
        if overlap > max_overlap:
            max_overlap = overlap
            best_x, best_y = x, y

# Output the best shift
print(f'{best_x} {best_y}')
```

This corrected version reads the tables correctly, calculates the overlap factor accurately, and finds the shift with the maximum overlap factor as required by the problem description.
