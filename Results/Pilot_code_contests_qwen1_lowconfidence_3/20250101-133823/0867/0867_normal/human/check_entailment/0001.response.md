Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the required functionality to find the shift with the maximum overlap factor between two tables. Instead, it includes two obfuscated functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) that do not seem to be related to the problem at hand. These functions perform bitwise operations that do not align with the problem's requirements.

To solve the problem correctly, the code needs to:
1. Iterate over all possible shifts (x, y).
2. For each shift, calculate the overlap factor using the defined formula.
3. Keep track of the shift with the maximum overlap factor.

Since the provided code does not implement these steps, it fails to meet the problem requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
