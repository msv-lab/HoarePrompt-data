Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the binary search approach required to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to relate to the described problem of finding the optimal shift for maximum overlap factor between two matrices. Instead, they appear to be obfuscating code possibly related to hashing or some other purpose. The main logic for calculating the overlap factor is missing, and the functions do not address the core problem of finding the shift with the maximum overlap factor.

To illustrate, let's consider the following input:

Input:
```
3 2
01
10
00
2 3
001
111
```

The expected output is:
```
0 1
```

However, the given code does not provide any mechanism to calculate the overlap factor or to find the optimal shift. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
