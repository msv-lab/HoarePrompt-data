Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not account for the following scenarios:

1. **Negative Shifts (`x` is negative)**: When `x` is negative, the condition `if i + x in range(0, nb):` ensures that only indices `i + x` that are non-negative are considered. However, the problem description does not impose any such restriction, and it should handle all valid shifts, including negative shifts. For instance, if `x` is -1 and `i` is 0, `i + x` should be considered valid even if it falls outside the bounds of `b`.

2. **Zero Shifts**: The code does not explicitly handle the case when `y` is zero. In such cases, the bitshift operations `a[i] << y` and `b[i + x] >> -y` do not change the values of `a[i]` and `b[i + x]`, respectively. This could lead to unnecessary operations, but more importantly, it does not affect the correctness of the solution since the problem is about finding the maximum overlap factor, which should still be calculated correctly.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
3 2
01
10
00
2 3
001
111
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 1
```

However, if the input is modified to include a negative shift:

**Input:**
```
3 2
01
10
00
2 3
001
111
```

With `x = -1` and `y = 0`, the current code will not consider the valid shift because `i + x` would be -1, which is out of bounds for `b`.

Therefore, the code is incorrect because it fails to handle all valid shifts, particularly negative shifts, as per the problem description.
