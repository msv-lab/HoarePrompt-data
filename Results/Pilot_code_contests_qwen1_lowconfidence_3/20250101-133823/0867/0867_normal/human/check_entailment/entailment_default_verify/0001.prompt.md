You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You've got two rectangular tables with sizes na × ma and nb × mb cells. The tables consist of zeroes and ones. We will consider the rows and columns of both tables indexed starting from 1. Then we will define the element of the first table, located at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column, as ai, j; we will define the element of the second table, located at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column, as bi, j. 

We will call the pair of integers (x, y) a shift of the second table relative to the first one. We'll call the overlap factor of the shift (x, y) value:

<image>

where the variables i, j take only such values, in which the expression ai, j·bi + x, j + y makes sense. More formally, inequalities 1 ≤ i ≤ na, 1 ≤ j ≤ ma, 1 ≤ i + x ≤ nb, 1 ≤ j + y ≤ mb must hold. If there are no values of variables i, j, that satisfy the given inequalities, the value of the sum is considered equal to 0. 

Your task is to find the shift with the maximum overlap factor among all possible shifts.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers na, ma (1 ≤ na, ma ≤ 50) — the number of rows and columns in the first table. Then na lines contain ma characters each — the elements of the first table. Each character is either a "0", or a "1".

The next line contains two space-separated integers nb, mb (1 ≤ nb, mb ≤ 50) — the number of rows and columns in the second table. Then follow the elements of the second table in the format, similar to the first table.

It is guaranteed that the first table has at least one number "1". It is guaranteed that the second table has at least one number "1".

Output

Print two space-separated integers x, y (|x|, |y| ≤ 109) — a shift with maximum overlap factor. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the required functionality to find the shift with the maximum overlap factor between two tables. Instead, it includes two obfuscated functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) that do not seem to be related to the problem at hand. These functions perform bitwise operations that do not align with the problem's requirements.

To solve the problem correctly, the code needs to:
1. Iterate over all possible shifts (x, y).
2. For each shift, calculate the overlap factor using the defined formula.
3. Keep track of the shift with the maximum overlap factor.

Since the provided code does not implement these steps, it fails to meet the problem requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It iterates over the indices of list `a` up to the length `na`. For each index `i`, it checks if the index `i + x` is within the bounds of list `b` (length `nb`). If `y` is positive, it applies a left bit shift operation (`<<`) on `a[i]` by `y` bits, then performs a bitwise AND operation with `b[i + x]`. If `y` is negative, it applies a right bit shift operation (`>>`) on `a[i]` by `-y` bits, then performs a bitwise AND operation with `b[i + x]`. The result of these operations is passed to `func_1`, and the returned value is added to the counter `cnt`. After the loop completes, the function returns the cumulative value of `cnt`. If no valid pairs `(i, i + x)` are found, `cnt` remains 0. This means the function essentially sums the results of `func_1` applied to specific bit-shifted pairs of elements from lists `a` and `b` based on the given shift values `x` and `y`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `x` is negative and `i + x` is less than 0, the condition `if i + x in range(0, nb):` will fail, and no action will be taken for those cases. This could lead to ignoring certain parts of the lists `a` and `b`.
- If `y` is zero, the code does not handle this case explicitly, which might result in unnecessary operations since shifting by zero bits would not change the value.
- The function assumes that `a` and `b` are of appropriate lengths and contain valid binary strings, but it does not perform any validation on these assumptions.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
