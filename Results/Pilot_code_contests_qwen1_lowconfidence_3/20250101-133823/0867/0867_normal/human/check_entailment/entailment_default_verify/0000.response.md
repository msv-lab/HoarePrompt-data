Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not implement the logic to find the optimal shift for maximum overlap factor between the two matrices. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are obfuscated and do not relate to solving the problem at hand. Specifically, `func_2` iterates over the elements of the matrices but does not calculate the overlap factor as defined in the problem statement. It performs bitwise operations without considering the actual values of the elements and the constraints of the problem. Additionally, the code does not handle the necessary logic to explore all possible shifts and find the one with the maximum overlap factor. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
