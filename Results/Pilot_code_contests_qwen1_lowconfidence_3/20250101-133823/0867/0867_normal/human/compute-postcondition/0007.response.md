Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `na` must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer, and `(i + x)` is in the range of 0 to `nb-1`. The value of `cnt` is updated as follows: if `y > 0`, then `cnt` is incremented by the result of `func_1(a[0] << y & b[0 + x])`; otherwise, `cnt` is updated by `func_1(a[0] & b[i + x] << -y)`.**
