The code `cnt += func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])` updates the value of `cnt`. However, the function `func_1`, the values of `a[i]`, `y`, and `b[i + x]` are not specified. Given the initial state, the only variables directly affected are `cnt` and the bitwise operations involving `a[i]`, `y`, and `b[i + x]`.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `a[i]`, `y`, `b[i + x]`, and `func_1`, we can only say that `cnt` is incremented by the result of `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])`.

Output State: **`i` is \( i_{prev} + 1 \) (or 1 + x if out of range), `cnt` is updated based on the previous iteration plus the result of `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])`, `na` is greater than 0, and `x` is an integer**
