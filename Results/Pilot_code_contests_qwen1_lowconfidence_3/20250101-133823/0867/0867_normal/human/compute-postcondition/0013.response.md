Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer in the range of 0 to `nb-1`, `na` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer, and `cnt` is updated based on the condition `i + x in range(0, nb)`. If `i + x` is within the range, `cnt` is incremented by the result of `func_1(a[1] << y & b[1 + x])` if `y > 0`, otherwise by `func_1(a[1] & b[1 + x] << -y)`. If `i + x` is not within the range, `i` is set to `1 + x` (ensuring it's in the range 0 to `nb-1`) and `cnt` is increased by `func_1(a[1] & b[1 + x] << -y)`.*
