The code updates the variable `cnt` by adding the result of `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)`. However, the initial values and conditions for `a`, `b`, `func_1`, `i`, `na`, `nb`, `x`, and `y` are not provided. We know that `i` is initially 1 and `(i + x)` must be in the range of 0 to `nb-1`. The precondition is that `na` must be greater than 0 and `x` is an integer.

Given these constraints, we can only say that `i` has been updated, but its exact new value depends on the values of `x` and `nb`. The function `func_1` is called with an argument that involves bitwise operations, but since the values of `a`, `b`, and `y` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of the function call.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `i` is now `1 + x`, ensuring it remains within the range of 0 to `nb-1`.
- `cnt` is updated by adding the result of `func_1(a[1] & b[1 + x] << -y)` to its current value.
- The preconditions for `na > 0` and `x` being an integer remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `1 + x` (ensuring it's in the range 0 to `nb-1`), `cnt` is increased by `func_1(a[1] & b[1 + x] << -y)`, `na` is greater than 0, and `x` is an integer.**
