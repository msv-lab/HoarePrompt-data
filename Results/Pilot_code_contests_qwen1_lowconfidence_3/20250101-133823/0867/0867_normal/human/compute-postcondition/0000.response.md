The code initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. Since no other operations are performed on `na`, `ma`, `nb`, `mb`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y`, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`na` is an integer between 1 and 50, `ma` is an integer between 1 and 50, `nb` is an integer between 1 and 50, `mb` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is a list of strings representing the rows of the first table, `b` is a list of strings representing the rows of the second table, `x` is an integer representing a potential shift relative to the first table, `y` is an integer representing a potential shift relative to the first table, `cnt` is 0.**
