The code snippet `cnt += func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])` involves several operations and the use of variables that are not fully defined in the initial state (like `func_1`, `a`, `b`, `y`, `i`, `x`, and `nb`). However, we can infer the following:

1. `i` is initially set to 1.
2. `(i + x)` must be in the range of 0 to `nb-1`. Given `i` is 1, `x` must be adjusted such that `1 + x` falls within this range.
3. `cnt` is incremented by the result of `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])`.

Since the values of `func_1`, `a`, `b`, `y`, and `nb` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `cnt`. But we know that `cnt` is incremented by the result of the function call.

The output state will be:
- `i` remains 1.
- `na` must be greater than 0 (unchanged).
- `x` must be such that `1 + x` is within the range of 0 to `nb-1`.
- `cnt` is incremented by the result of `func_1(a[1] << y & b[1 + x])`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `na` must be greater than 0, `x` must be such that `1 + x` is within the range of 0 to `nb-1`, `cnt` is incremented by the result of `func_1(a[1] << y & b[1 + x])`**
