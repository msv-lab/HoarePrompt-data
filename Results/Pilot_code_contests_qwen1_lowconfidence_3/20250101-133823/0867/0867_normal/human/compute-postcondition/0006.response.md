`cnt` is incremented by the value of `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)`. Here, `a[i]` and `b[i + x]` are elements of arrays `a` and `b` respectively, and their bitwise AND operation is shifted left by `-y` positions. Since `y` is less than or equal to 0, `-y` will be a non-negative number, meaning the shift operation will effectively shift the bits to the left by a non-negative amount.

Given the precondition that `(i + x)` is in the range of 0 to `nb-1`, this ensures that `i + x` is a valid index for array `b`.

The values of `a[i]`, `b[i + x]`, and `y` will affect the result of `func_1`, but since these values are not specified, we can only say that `cnt` is updated by the value of `func_1` applied to the described operation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `na` must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `(i + x)` is in the range of 0 to `nb-1`, `y` is less than or equal to 0, and `cnt` is updated by `func_1(a[0] & b[i + x] << -y)`**
