Postcondition: ***`i` is \( i_{prev} + 1 \) (or 1 + x if out of range), `cnt` is updated based on the previous iteration according to whether `y` is greater than 0, `na` is greater than 0, and `x` is an integer. If `y > 0`, `cnt` is updated by the result of `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])`. Otherwise, `cnt` is updated by the result of `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)` from the previous iteration.***
