Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 0
   - `na` must be greater than 0
   - `x` is an integer
   - `(i + x)` is in the range of 0 to `nb-1`

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < na`.

3. **What happens inside the loop**:
   - For each `i` in the range `[0, na-1]`, the condition `(i + x)` is checked to see if it is in the range `[0, nb-1]`.
   - If `(i + x)` is in the range `[0, nb-1]`, then:
     - `cnt` is updated based on the value of `y`:
       - If `y > 0`, then `cnt` is incremented by the result of `func_1(a[0] << y & b[0 + x])`.
       - Otherwise, `cnt` is updated by `func_1(a[0] & b[i + x] << -y)`.
   - If `(i + x)` is not in the range `[0, nb-1]`, the postcondition remains unchanged.

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `na` must be greater than 0
   - `x` is an integer
   - `(i + x)` is in the range of 0 to `nb-1`

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.

6. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `(i + x)` should still be in the range of 0 to `nb-1`.
   - This means that `1 + x` must be in the range of 0 to `nb-1`.

7. **Updated States**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `na` must still be greater than 0.
   - `x` remains an integer.
   - `(i + x)` must be in the range of 0 to `nb-1`, which now means `1 + x` must be in the range of 0 to `nb-1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `na` must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer, and `(i + x)` must be in the range of 0 to `nb-1`.**
