Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer in the range of 0 to `nb-1`, `na` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer. If `y > 0`, then `i` is 1, `cnt` is incremented by the result of `func_1(a[1] << y & b[1 + x])`. Otherwise, `i` is `1 + x`, ensuring it's in the range 0 to `nb-1`, and `cnt` is increased by `func_1(a[1] & b[1 + x] << -y)`.***
