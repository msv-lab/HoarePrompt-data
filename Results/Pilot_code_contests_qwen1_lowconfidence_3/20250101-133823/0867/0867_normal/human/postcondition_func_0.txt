The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` and returns a modified version of `x` based on a specific bitwise operation. Specifically, it applies a series of bitwise AND and right shift operations on `x`. The final result is obtained by performing `(x & 18446744073709551615) + (x >> 32 & 18446744073709551615)`. This process involves breaking down the integer into smaller parts using bitwise operations and then combining them back together. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly; however, it is designed to work with non-negative integers since the operations involve bitwise shifts and masks. If `x` were negative, the behavior would depend on the specific bitwise operations and the Python interpreter's handling of negative numbers.
