The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It iterates over the indices of list `a` up to the length `na`. For each index `i`, it checks if the index `i + x` is within the bounds of list `b` (length `nb`). If `y` is positive, it applies a left bit shift operation (`<<`) on `a[i]` by `y` bits, then performs a bitwise AND operation with `b[i + x]`. If `y` is negative, it applies a right bit shift operation (`>>`) on `a[i]` by `-y` bits, then performs a bitwise AND operation with `b[i + x]`. The result of these operations is passed to `func_1`, and the returned value is added to the counter `cnt`. After the loop completes, the function returns the cumulative value of `cnt`. If no valid pairs `(i, i + x)` are found, `cnt` remains 0. This means the function essentially sums the results of `func_1` applied to specific bit-shifted pairs of elements from lists `a` and `b` based on the given shift values `x` and `y`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `x` is negative and `i + x` is less than 0, the condition `if i + x in range(0, nb):` will fail, and no action will be taken for those cases. This could lead to ignoring certain parts of the lists `a` and `b`.
- If `y` is zero, the code does not handle this case explicitly, which might result in unnecessary operations since shifting by zero bits would not change the value.
- The function assumes that `a` and `b` are of appropriate lengths and contain valid binary strings, but it does not perform any validation on these assumptions.
