#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 1 <= x, y, z <= 1000.
def func_1(x, y, z):
    if (z < 4 or y < 2 or x < 1) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    else :
        delit = z / 4
        while delit >= 1:
            if y / delit >= 1 and x / delit >= 1:
                return delit
            else:
                delit = delit - 1
            
        #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000; `y` is a non-negative integer between 2 and 1000; `z` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4; `delit` is 1.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `x` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000; `y` is a non-negative integer between 2 and 1000; `z` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4; `delit` is 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` (where 1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 1000) and returns either 0 or `z / 4` based on certain conditions. Specifically:

- If `z < 4`, `y < 2`, or `x < 1`, the function returns 0.
- Otherwise, the function enters a loop where it calculates `delit` as `z / 4` and decrements `delit` until it finds a value such that both `y / delit` and `x / delit` are at least 1. If such a value is found, it returns `delit`. If no such value is found within the loop, the function returns 1.

Potential edge cases:
- If `z` is less than 4, `y` is less than 2, or `x` is less than 1, the function immediately returns 0.
- If no valid `delit` is found during the loop, the function returns 1.

Missing functionality:
- The annotation mentions that the function may attempt to return a variable named 'delit', but since 'delit' is only defined within the loop and the loop condition ensures it is defined before returning, this is not a missing functionality but a correct understanding of the code flow.
