The code `delit = z / 4` divides the value of `z` by 4 and assigns the result to the variable `delit`. Since `z` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, and it is given that `z >= 4`, `delit` will be a floating-point number representing `z / 4`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `y` is a non-negative integer between 2 and 1000, `z` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4, `delit` is `z / 4`**
