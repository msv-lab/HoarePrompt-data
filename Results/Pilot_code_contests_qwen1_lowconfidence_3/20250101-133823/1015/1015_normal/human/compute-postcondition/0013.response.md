Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `delit >= 1`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is such that `delit` is a variable, but there was a potential `NameError` because `delit` was not defined initially. For the loop to execute, `delit` must be incremented to a value such that `delit >= 1` holds true.

3. **Loop Execution Requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, `delit` must be at least 1.

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since `delit` was not defined initially and led to a potential `NameError`, we need to ensure that `delit` is defined and set to a value such that the loop condition `delit >= 1` is satisfied.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is that `delit` must be defined and set to a value of at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`delit` must be defined and its value must be at least 1**
