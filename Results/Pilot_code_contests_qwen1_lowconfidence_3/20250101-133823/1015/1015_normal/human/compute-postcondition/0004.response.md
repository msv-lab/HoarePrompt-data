Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `x` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `y` is a non-negative integer between 2 and 1000.
   - `z` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4.
   - `delit` is `z / 4`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `delit >= 1`.

3. **Current State Before Loop:**
   - `delit` is `z / 4`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `delit >= 1` must be true.

4. **Analyzing the Condition:**
   - Since `delit = z / 4`, for `delit >= 1` to be true, `z` must be at least 4 (since `z` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4).

Given the current state where `z` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4, we do not need to adjust this state further because it already satisfies the condition.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `x` and `y` do not affect the loop condition directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Since the loop condition is already satisfied with the given values of `z`, no additional adjustments are needed.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`x` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `y` is a non-negative integer between 2 and 1000, `z` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4, `delit` is `z / 4`**
