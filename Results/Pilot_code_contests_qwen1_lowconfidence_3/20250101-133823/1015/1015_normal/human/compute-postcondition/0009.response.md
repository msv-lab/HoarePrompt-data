Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `x` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `y` is a non-negative integer between 2 and 1000.
   - `z` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4.
   - `delit` is calculated as `z / 4 - 1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `delit >= 1`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - After each iteration, `delit` is reduced, but the exact reduction is not specified in the problem. However, we know that `delit` starts from a value and decreases until it becomes less than 1.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `delit` must be at least 1 at the end of the current iteration.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `delit` must be 1 or greater.

5. **Calculating the Initial Value of `delit`:**
   - Given `delit = z / 4 - 1`, for `delit` to be 1 or greater, the following inequality must hold:
     \[
     z / 4 - 1 \geq 1
     \]
   - Solving for `z`:
     \[
     z / 4 \geq 2 \implies z \geq 8
     \]

6. **Final States:**
   - Since `z` is initially a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4, and for the loop to execute one more time, `z` must be at least 8.
   - The values of `x` and `y` do not affect the loop condition, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `z` must be at least 8.

**State:** **`x` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000; `y` is a non-negative integer between 2 and 1000; `z` must be at least 8; `delit` is `z / 4 - 1`**
