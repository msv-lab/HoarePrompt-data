`delit` is assigned the value `z / 4`. Given the condition `(y / delit < 1 or x / delit < 1)` holds true, and since `delit` is currently `z / 4`, subtracting 1 from `delit` should still satisfy the condition because `z` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4, making `delit` initially greater than 1. After decrementing `delit` by 1, the new value of `delit` will be `z / 4 - 1`.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `x` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000
- `y` is a non-negative integer between 2 and 1000
- `z` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4
- `delit` is now `z / 4 - 1`

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000; `y` is a non-negative integer between 2 and 1000; `z` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4; `delit` is `z / 4 - 1`.**
