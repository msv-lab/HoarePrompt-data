`delit` is decremented by 1. The initial condition is that `delit` must be defined and its value must be at least 1. After executing `delit = delit - 1`, `delit` will be one less than its original value, but it will still be at least 0 because it started at least at 1.

Output State: **`delit` is `delit - 1`**
