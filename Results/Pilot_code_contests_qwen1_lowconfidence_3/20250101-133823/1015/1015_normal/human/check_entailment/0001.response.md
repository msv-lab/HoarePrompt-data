Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the number of lemons, apples, and pears do not allow for a complete set of fruits in the required ratio (1:2:4). Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used. 

For example, consider the input:
```
2
3
2
```

According to the problem description, Nikolay should not be able to use any fruits because he does not have enough pears to form a complete set (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears). However, the current implementation would incorrectly return 0, which is the correct output for this case. Therefore, the program is correct in this specific example.

However, the issue lies in more complex cases. For instance, consider the input:
```
2
5
1
```

Here, Nikolay has 2 lemons, 5 apples, and 1 pear. The program should return 0 because there are not enough pears to form a complete set (1 lemon requires 4 pears). But the current implementation would not handle this case correctly, as it would incorrectly try to form sets without checking if there are enough pears. 

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
