Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads three integers representing the number of lemons (`limon`), apples (`yabl`), and pears (`grush`) respectively. These inputs are valid as per the problem statement (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters (`x`, `y`, `z`) corresponding to the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively.
   - It first checks if the number of pears (`z`) is less than 4, the number of apples (`y`) is less than 2, or the number of lemons (`x`) is less than 1. If any of these conditions are true, it returns 0. This aligns with the problem statement where if any fruit count does not meet the required ratio, the output should be 0.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the function calculates the maximum number of compotes that can be made. It initializes `delit` as `z / 4` and decrements it until it finds a value such that both `y / delit` and `x / delit` are at least 1. This ensures that the compote can be made with the required ratio (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears per compote).
   - The function then returns the maximum number of compotes that can be made. Since each compote requires 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears, the maximum number of compotes is `delit`.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The main part of the program calls `func_1` with the input values and prints the result multiplied by 7, which corresponds to the total number of fruits used (1 lemon + 2 apples + 4 pears = 7 fruits per compote).

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to make the compote according to the specified ratio. Therefore, the program is correct.
