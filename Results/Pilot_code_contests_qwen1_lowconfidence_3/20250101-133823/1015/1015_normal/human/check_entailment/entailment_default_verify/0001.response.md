Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided output hints and the problem description reveal that the function `func_1` does not correctly handle all edge cases. Specifically, the function does not ensure that the number of apples and lemons is sufficient for the required ratio (1:2:4) after finding a valid `delit`. This oversight leads to incorrect results in scenarios where the number of lemons, apples, and pears do not allow for a complete set of fruits in the required ratio. For instance, the input `(2, 5, 1)` should return `0`, but the current implementation does not handle this case correctly.
