Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version clarifies that the function `func_1` does not correctly handle all edge cases. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the number of lemons, apples, and pears can form complete sets in the required ratio (1:2:4). 

For example, consider the input:
```
2
5
1
```

Here, Nikolay has 2 lemons, 5 apples, and 1 pear. According to the problem description, Nikolay should not be able to use any fruits because he does not have enough pears to form a complete set (1 lemon requires 4 pears). However, the current implementation would incorrectly return 0, which is the correct output for this case.

Additionally, the annotated version shows that the function `func_1` does not correctly decrement `delit` until a valid set of fruits is found or until `delit` reaches 1. This means that if there are no valid sets of fruits, the function will return 1 instead of 0, leading to incorrect results in many cases. Thus, the program is incorrect based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code.
