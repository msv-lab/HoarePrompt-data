You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Nikolay has a lemons, b apples and c pears. He decided to cook a compote. According to the recipe the fruits should be in the ratio 1: 2: 4. It means that for each lemon in the compote should be exactly 2 apples and exactly 4 pears. You can't crumble up, break up or cut these fruits into pieces. These fruits — lemons, apples and pears — should be put in the compote as whole fruits.

Your task is to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. It is possible that Nikolay can't use any fruits, in this case print 0. 

Input

The first line contains the positive integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) — the number of lemons Nikolay has. 

The second line contains the positive integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) — the number of apples Nikolay has. 

The third line contains the positive integer c (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000) — the number of pears Nikolay has.

Output

Print the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote.

Examples

Input

2
5
7


Output

7


Input

4
7
13


Output

21


Input

2
3
2


Output

0

Note

In the first example Nikolay can use 1 lemon, 2 apples and 4 pears, so the answer is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

In the second example Nikolay can use 3 lemons, 6 apples and 12 pears, so the answer is 3 + 6 + 12 = 21.

In the third example Nikolay don't have enough pears to cook any compote, so the answer is 0. 
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    limon = int(raw_input())
    yabl = int(raw_input())
    grush = int(raw_input())
    delit = func_1(limon, yabl, grush)
    print(str(delit * 7))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 1 <= x, y, z <= 1000.
def func_1(x, y, z):
    if (z < 4 or y < 2 or x < 1) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    else :
        delit = z / 4
        while delit >= 1:
            if y / delit >= 1 and x / delit >= 1:
                return delit
            else:
                delit = delit - 1
            
        #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000; `y` is a non-negative integer between 2 and 1000; `z` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4; `delit` is 1.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `x` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000; `y` is a non-negative integer between 2 and 1000; `z` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4; `delit` is 1.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
