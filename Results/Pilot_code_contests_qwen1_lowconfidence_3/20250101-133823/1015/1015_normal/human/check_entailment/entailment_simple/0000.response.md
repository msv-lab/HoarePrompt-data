Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads three integers representing the number of lemons (`limon`), apples (`yabl`), and pears (`grush`) from the input. These inputs are assumed to be valid as per the problem statement.

2. **Ratio Checking and Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the number of pears (`z`) is at least 4, the number of apples (`y`) is at least 2, and the number of lemons (`x`) is at least 1. If any of these conditions fail, it immediately returns 0, indicating that no compote can be made.
   - If all conditions are met, it calculates the maximum number of compotes (`delit`) that can be made. Since each compote requires 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears, `delit` is set to `z // 4`.
   - It then iterates backwards from `delit` to find the largest value of `delit` such that there are at least `2 * delit` apples and at least `delit` lemons available. This ensures that the fruits are used in the exact ratio specified (1:2:4).
   - If no such `delit` exists (i.e., the loop exits with `delit` equal to 1), the function returns 1, indicating that even one compote can be made if the smallest ratio requirement is met.

3. **Output**: The total number of fruits used in the compote is calculated as `delit * 7` (since each compote uses 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears) and printed.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program will always produce the correct output for the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
