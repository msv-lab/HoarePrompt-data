Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not ensure that the number of apples and pears is exactly twice and four times the number of lemons, respectively. Instead, it only checks if the current value of `delit` satisfies the conditions for apples and lemons without ensuring that the actual counts of apples and pears are sufficient for the required ratio.

For example, consider the following input:
- Lemons: 3
- Apples: 9
- Pears: 12

The correct solution should use 3 lemons, 6 apples, and 12 pears, resulting in a total of 21 fruits. However, the code incorrectly returns 1 because it only checks if `y / delit >= 1` and `x / delit >= 1` without ensuring that the actual counts of apples and pears are sufficient.

To fix this, the function should calculate the minimum number of sets of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used while maintaining the ratio 1:2:4. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    limon = int(input())
    yabl = int(input())
    grush = int(input())
    delit = func_1(limon, yabl, grush)
    print(str(delit * 7))

def func_1(x, y, z):
    if z < 4 * x or y < 2 * x or x < 1:
        return 0
    else:
        return min(x, y // 2, z // 4)
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of lemons, apples, and pears are in the correct ratio and calculates the maximum number of sets that can be used.
