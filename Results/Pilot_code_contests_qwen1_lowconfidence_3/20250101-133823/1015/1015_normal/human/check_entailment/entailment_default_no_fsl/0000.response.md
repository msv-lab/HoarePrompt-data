Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly determine the maximum number of fruits that can be used in the compote according to the given ratio (1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears). Instead, it attempts to find a value of `delit` such that `y / delit >= 1` and `x / delit >= 1`, which does not necessarily maximize the total number of fruits used.

For example, consider the following input:
- Lemons: 2
- Apples: 5
- Pears: 7

The correct output should be 7 (using 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears). However, the code incorrectly returns 2 because it finds that `y / 2 >= 1` and `x / 2 >= 1`, even though using 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears would yield a higher total count.

To fix this, the function should calculate the minimum number of sets of (1 lemon, 2 apples, 4 pears) that can be formed from the available fruits and then multiply this by 7 (1 + 2 + 4).

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    limon = int(input())
    yabl = int(input())
    grush = int(input())
    delit = func_1(limon, yabl, grush)
    print(str(delit * 7))

def func_1(x, y, z):
    min_limon = x // 1
    min_yabl = y // 2
    min_grush = z // 4
    return min(min_limon, min_yabl, min_grush)

```

This version correctly calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used in the compote and multiplies this by 7 to get the total number of fruits.
