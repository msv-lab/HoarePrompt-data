Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of pears is less than 4, the number of apples is less than 2, or the number of lemons is less than 1. In such cases, the function `func_1` should return 0, but the current implementation subtracts 1 from `delit` until it finds a valid division, which is not necessary and may lead to incorrect results. Specifically, if the inputs do not meet the required ratios from the start, the program should immediately return 0 without entering the loop.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1
1
```
The program should return 0 because there are not enough apples and pears to satisfy the 1:2:4 ratio. However, the current implementation will attempt to find a valid `delit` value, leading to an incorrect result.
