The code snippet `lst2 = set(lst2)` converts `lst2` from a list to a set. This means that all duplicate elements in `lst2` will be removed, and the order of elements is not preserved.

Given the initial state:
- `nk` is 0
- `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list (unchanged by this operation)
- `lst2` is a list of integers from the input (converted to a set)
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer

After executing the code, `lst2` will be a set with the same elements as the original list, but without any duplicates, and in an unspecified order.

Output State: **`nk` is 0; `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list; `lst2` is a set of integers from the input; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer**
