The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the most nested block it is in. Since there is no explicit loop or nested block in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program will exit the current loop or block. 

Given the initial state: `nk` is 1, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, and the current value of `i` remains printed as 1.

After executing the `break` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged except for the fact that the program will exit the current loop or block.

Output State: **`nk` is 1, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, and the current value of `i` remains printed as 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
