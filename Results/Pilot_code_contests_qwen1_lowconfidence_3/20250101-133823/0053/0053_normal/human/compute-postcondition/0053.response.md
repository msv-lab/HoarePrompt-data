The code prints `1, i`. Since `i` is the next element in `lst1`, and `nk` is initially 1, the output will be `1` followed by the next element in `lst1`. However, the actual value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so we will denote it as `i`.

The printed output being 'YES' does not affect the variables listed in the initial state. 

Therefore, the Output State is: **`nk` is 1, `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list excluding the last checked element, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and the value of `i` is the next element in `lst1`. Printed output is 'YES'**.
