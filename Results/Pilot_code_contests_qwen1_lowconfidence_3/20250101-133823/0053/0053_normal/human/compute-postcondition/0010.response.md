The code prints 'YES', which does not affect any variables. The values of `nk`, `lst1`, `lst2`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nk` is 0, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, and the current value of `i` is in `lst2`. The print statement is executed, but this does not change the values of the variables.

Output State: **`nk` is 0, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, and the current value of `i` is in `lst2`**
