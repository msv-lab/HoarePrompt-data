To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information:

1. The loop runs based on the input from `int(input())`.
2. The variable `nk` is either 0 or 1.
3. If `nk` is 1, it means a match was found between `lst1` and `lst2`, and 'YES' is printed along with the 1-based index and the value of the matching element.
4. If `nk` remains 0, no such element was found, and no output is printed.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `nk` is either 0 or 1.
- If `nk` is 1, a match was found, and 'YES' is printed with details.
- If `nk` is 0, no match was found, and no output is printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, the input must be provided again. The key point here is that the condition for the loop to continue is the presence of additional input. Since the loop runs based on `int(input())`, the loop will continue as long as there is another input.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that there is another input available for the loop to process. This implies that `nk` should remain 0 (indicating no match was found in the previous iteration) or be reset to its initial state (either 0 or 1), and an additional input is provided.

Given this, the state can be described as follows:

State: **`nk` is either 0 or 1, depending on the previous iteration's outcome, and an additional input is provided for the loop to process.**
