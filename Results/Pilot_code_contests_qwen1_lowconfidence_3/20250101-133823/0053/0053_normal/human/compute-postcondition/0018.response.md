`nk` is assigned the value 1, which changes its state. The other variables (`lst1` and `lst2`) remain unchanged. The output is 1 followed by the value of `i`, but since `i` is not mentioned in the initial state or code, it remains unspecified.

Output State: **`nk` is 1, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, and the output is 1 followed by the value of `i`.**
