The `break` statement is used to exit the loop it is inside. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the variables `nk` and `lst1` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is not defined before the break statement, so we cannot determine its value after the break. However, according to the initial state, the output is specified to be "1 followed by the value of `i`". After the break, this part of the output will not be produced.

Output State: **`nk` is 1, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
