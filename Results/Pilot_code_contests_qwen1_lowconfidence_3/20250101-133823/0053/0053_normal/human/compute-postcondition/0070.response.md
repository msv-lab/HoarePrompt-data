The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console and does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `nk`, `n`, `m`, `lst1`, `i`, and `i` being in `lst2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nk` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `lst1` is a non-empty set containing the unique elements from the original list of integers, `i` is the first element in `lst1`, and `i` is in `lst2`. The string 'YES' is printed to the console.**
