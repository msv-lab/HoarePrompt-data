Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `nk` is 0.
   - `lst1` is a set of integers from the input.
   - `lst2` is a set of integers from the input.
   - 'NO' is printed to the console.

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop runs for an integer number of times specified by the user (input).
   - Since `_` is used as the loop variable, it doesn't matter what value `_` takes; the loop just iterates the specified number of times.

4. **Current State After Previous Iteration**:
   - The previous iteration has already occurred, and now we need to determine the state for the next iteration.

5. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop will execute one more time if the user inputs a positive integer (since the loop runs for the specified number of times).
   - After the previous iteration, the value of `int(input())` would have been decremented by 1 compared to the original input.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration to occur, the user must input a positive integer that would bring the counter back to a non-zero value.

6. **Updated States**:
   - `nk` remains 0 because the loop variable `_` is ignored.
   - `lst1` and `lst2` remain unchanged as no modifications were made inside the loop body.
   - Since the loop is about to execute again, 'NO' will be printed once more before the loop body runs.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
**`nk` is 0, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, and 'NO' is printed to the console.**

State: **`nk` is 0, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, and 'NO' is printed to the console.**
