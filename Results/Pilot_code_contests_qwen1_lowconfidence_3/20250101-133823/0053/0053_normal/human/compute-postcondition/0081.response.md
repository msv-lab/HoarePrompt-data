According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the list `lst1`. The loop iterates over each element in `lst1`. At the end of the last iteration, `nk` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `lst1` is a non-empty set containing the unique elements from the original list of integers, `i` is the second element in `lst1`, and the console displays '1' and the second element of `lst1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be the third element in `lst1`. Additionally, since the condition for continuing the loop is checking if `i` is in `lst2`, we need to ensure that `i` is indeed in `lst2` or not, but this doesn't change the fact that the loop needs to move to the next element in `lst1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`nk` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `lst1` is a non-empty set containing the unique elements from the original list of integers, `i` is the third element in `lst1`, and the console displays '1' and the third element of `lst1`.**
