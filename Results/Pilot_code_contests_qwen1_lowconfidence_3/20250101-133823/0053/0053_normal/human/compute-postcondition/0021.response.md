According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the set `lst1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `lst1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `nk` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether `i` was found in `lst2`. If `i` was found in `lst2`, `nk` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. However, this information about `nk` does not directly affect the continuation of the current loop, which iterates over `lst1`.

The key point here is that the loop will continue to execute as long as `lst1` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `lst1` still contains at least one element for the loop to continue.

State: **`nk` is either 0 or 1, `lst1` must have at least one integer.**
