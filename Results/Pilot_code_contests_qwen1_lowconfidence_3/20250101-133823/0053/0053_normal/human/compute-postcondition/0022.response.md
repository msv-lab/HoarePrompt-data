The code `print('YES')` does not affect the values of the variables `nk` or `lst1`. It simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the only change is that the program outputs 'YES', but the values of `nk` and `lst1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nk` is either 0 or 1; `lst1` must have at least one integer; the program outputs 'YES'**
