The code `break` does not affect any variable values but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. Since there is no loop or if statement in the given initial state, the break statement simply ends the current operation without changing any variable values.

Output State: **`nk` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `lst1` is a non-empty set containing the unique elements from the original list of integers, the console displays '1' and the second element of `lst1`, `i` is the second element in `lst1`.**
