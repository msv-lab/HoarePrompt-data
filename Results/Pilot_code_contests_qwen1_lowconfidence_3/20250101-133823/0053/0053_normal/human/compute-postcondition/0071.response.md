The code `print(1, i)` prints the value `1` followed by the value of `i`. Since `i` is the first element in `lst1`, the value of `i` remains unchanged. The output to the console is `1` followed by `i`.

Output State: **`nk` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `lst1` is a non-empty set containing the unique elements from the original list of integers, `i` is the first element in `lst1`, and 'YES' is printed to the console.**
