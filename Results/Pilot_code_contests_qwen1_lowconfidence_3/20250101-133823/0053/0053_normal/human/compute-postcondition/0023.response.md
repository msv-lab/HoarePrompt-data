The code `print(1, i)` prints the value `1` followed by the value of `i`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the given initial state, and there is no assignment or initialization for `i` in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the value of `i` remains unknown. The output state will include the print statement's effect, but the exact value of `i` cannot be determined from the initial state alone.

Output State: **`nk` is either 0 or 1; `lst1` must have at least one integer; the program outputs 'YES' and then prints '1' followed by an unknown value `i`.**
