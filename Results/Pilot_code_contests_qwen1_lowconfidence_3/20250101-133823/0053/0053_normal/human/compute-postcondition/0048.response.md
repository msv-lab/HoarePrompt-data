The code `nk = 1` does not affect the existing variables, and it assigns the value `1` to `nk`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `nk` and keeps the initial values of the other variables.

Output State: **`nk` is 1, `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list with at least one element, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, the value of `i` is the next element in `lst1`, and the console prints '1' and `i + 1`.**
