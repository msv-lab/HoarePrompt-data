Postcondition: ***`nk` is 1, `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list with at least one element, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and the value of `i` is the next element in `lst1`. If `i` is in `lst2`, the loop or conditional block is exited. Otherwise, the block does nothing and the original values of `i` remain unchanged.***
