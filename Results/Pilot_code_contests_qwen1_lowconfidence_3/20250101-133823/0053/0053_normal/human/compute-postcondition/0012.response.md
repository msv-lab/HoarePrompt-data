The code sets `nk` to 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `lst1` and `lst2` remain unchanged, and the value of `i` also remains unchanged since it is only printed and not reassigned. 

Output State: **`nk` is 1, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, and the current value of `i` remains printed as 1.**
