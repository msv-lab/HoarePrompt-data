The code `lst1 = set(lst1)` converts the list `lst1` into a set, removing any duplicate elements in `lst1`. Since `lst1` was originally a list of integers, converting it to a set will keep only unique elements.

Given the initial state:
- `nk` is 0
- `n` is an integer from the input
- `m` is an integer from the input
- `lst1` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `lst2` is a list of integers obtained from the input

After executing `lst1 = set(lst1)`, `lst1` becomes a set containing the unique elements from the original list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nk` is 0; `n` is an integer from the input; `m` is an integer from the input; `lst1` is a set containing the unique elements from the original list of integers; `lst2` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
