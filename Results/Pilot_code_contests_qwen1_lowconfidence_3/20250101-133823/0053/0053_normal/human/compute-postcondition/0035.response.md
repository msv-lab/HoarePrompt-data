The code `nk = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `nk`. This does not affect the values of `lst1`, `lst2`, `n`, or `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nk` is 0, `lst1` is a list of integers from the input, `lst2` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.

Output State: **`nk` is 0, `lst1` is a list of integers from the input, `lst2` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**
