Postcondition: ***`nk` is 1, `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list with at least one element, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, the current value of `i` is in `lst2`, and the console prints '1' and `i`.***

Explanation:
- If `i` is in `lst2`, then `nk` becomes 1, and the current value of `i` is printed.
- Since there is no else part, if `i` is not in `lst2`, the program simply continues without changing `nk` or altering any other variables in a way that would affect the overall postcondition.
