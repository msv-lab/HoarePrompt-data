The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match statement. In this case, since it is outside of any loop or match statement, it simply exits the context in which it was placed. The variables `nk` and `lst1` remain unchanged. The program outputs 'YES' and then prints '1' followed by an unknown value `i`, but these actions occur before the `break` statement and are not affected by it.

Output State: **`nk` is 1, `lst1` must have at least one integer, the program outputs 'YES' and then prints '1' followed by an unknown value `i`**
