The code snippet creates a new list `lst2` by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. This means that the values of `nk`, `n`, `m`, and `lst1` remain unchanged, while `lst2` is now a list of integers obtained from the input.

Since the input is not specified, let's denote the input as a space-separated string of integers, for example, "1 2 3". After splitting and converting, `lst2` will be `[1, 2, 3]`.

Output State: **`nk` is either 0 or 1; `n` is an integer from the input; `m` is an integer from the input; `lst1` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `lst2` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
