State: **`nk` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `lst1` is a non-empty set containing the unique elements from the original list of integers, `i` is the first element in `lst1`**.

### Explanation:
- The loop `for i in lst1:` iterates over each element in the set `lst1`.
- For the loop to execute, `lst1` must contain at least one element because sets cannot be empty when used in a for loop.
- The initial value of `i` (the iterator) will be the first element in `lst1` during the first iteration of the loop.

Thus, the required adjustments to ensure the loop can execute are that `lst1` must be a non-empty set, and `i` is initialized to the first element of `lst1`.
