The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `nk`, `lst1`, `lst2`, `n`, and `m`. The output state includes the printed string and the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`nk` is 1, `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and the console displays 'NO'**
