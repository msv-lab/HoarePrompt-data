The code snippet `nk = 1` does not affect any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It only reassigns the value of `nk` to 1, which was already its value according to the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`nk` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `lst1` is a non-empty set containing the unique elements from the original list of integers, `i` is the third element in `lst1`, the console displays 'YES', and the output of the print statement is `1` followed by `i`.**
