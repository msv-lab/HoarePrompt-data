The code prints `1` followed by the value of `i`. Since `i` is the third element in `lst1`, and `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list of integers, `i` remains unchanged. The print statement does not alter the values of other variables.

Output State: **`nk` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `lst1` is a non-empty set containing the unique elements from the original list of integers, `i` is the third element in `lst1`, the console displays 'YES', and the output of the print statement is `1` followed by `i`.**
