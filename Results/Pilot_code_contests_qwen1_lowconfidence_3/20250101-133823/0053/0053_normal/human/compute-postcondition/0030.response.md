Postcondition: ***`nk` is 0, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, and 'NO' is printed to the console.*** 

Explanation: Since the `if` condition checks if `nk == 0`, and given that the `if` part's postcondition states that `nk` remains 0, `lst1` and `lst2` remain as sets of integers from the input, and 'NO' is printed to the console, the `else` part is not executed. Therefore, the overall postcondition is derived directly from the `if` part's postcondition.
