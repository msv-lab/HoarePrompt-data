The code snippet `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `nk`, `n`, `m`, `lst1`, or the conditions related to `lst2`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`nk` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `lst1` is a non-empty set containing the unique elements from the original list of integers, and the console displays 'NO'**
