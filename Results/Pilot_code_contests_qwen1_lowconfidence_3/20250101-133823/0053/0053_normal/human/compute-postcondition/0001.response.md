Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop**: The loop is controlled by the expression `int(input())`. This means the loop will execute as long as `input()` returns a non-empty string when converted to an integer.

2. **Initial State of Variables**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - The loop will run `t` times, reading values from the input for each iteration.

3. **Input Handling**: Each iteration of the loop will read three lines:
   - The first line will contain two integers \(n\) and \(m\) (both between 1 and 1000).
   - The second line will contain \(n\) integers.
   - The third line will contain \(m\) integers.

4. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - For the loop to execute, `input()` must return a non-empty string, which is guaranteed because the number of test cases \(t\) is given by `t`.

5. **Required Adjustments**:
   - Since `t` is given as a positive integer, the loop will execute exactly `t` times.
   - The loop body will process the input for each test case.

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can start and execute correctly.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- For each of the `t` iterations, the loop will read:
  - Two integers \(n\) and \(m\) (both between 1 and 1000).
  - `n` integers in the second line.
  - `m` integers in the third line.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), and for each of the `t` iterations, the loop will read two integers \(n\) and \(m\) (both between 1 and 1000), followed by `n` integers in the second line, and `m` integers in the third line.**
