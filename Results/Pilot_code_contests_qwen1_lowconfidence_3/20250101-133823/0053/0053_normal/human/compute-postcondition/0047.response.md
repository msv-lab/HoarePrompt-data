The code `print(1, i)` prints the value `1` followed by the value of `i`. Since `i` is the next element in `lst1` and `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list with at least one element, the value of `i` is a specific element from `lst1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nk` is 1, `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list with at least one element, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, the value of `i` is the next element in `lst1`, and the console prints '1' and `i + 1`.**
