The code snippet replaces the current value of `lst1` with a new list of integers obtained from the input. The previous value of `lst1` is a set of integers from the input, which is now replaced by a list of integers from the same input. The other variables (`nk`, `lst2`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nk` is 0, `lst1` is a list of integers from the input, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**
