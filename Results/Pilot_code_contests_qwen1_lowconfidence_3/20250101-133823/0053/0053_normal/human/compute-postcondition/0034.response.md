The code `lst2 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes an input string, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `lst2`. The other variables (`nk`, `lst1`, `n`, and `m`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`nk` is 0, `lst1` is a list of integers from the input, `lst2` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**
