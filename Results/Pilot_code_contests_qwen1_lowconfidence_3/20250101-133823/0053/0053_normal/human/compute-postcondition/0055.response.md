The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most innermost if statement. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement affecting the variables `nk`, `lst1`, `lst2`, `n`, `m`, and `i` directly within the provided code snippet, the values of these variables remain unchanged. The printed output is 'YES', which indicates the result of some condition being met but does not affect the variables.

Output State: **`nk` is 1, `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list excluding the last checked element, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and the value of `i` is the next element in `lst1`. Printed output is 'YES'**
