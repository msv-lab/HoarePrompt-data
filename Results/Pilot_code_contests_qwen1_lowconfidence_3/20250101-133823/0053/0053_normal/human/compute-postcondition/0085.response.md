The code `break` does not affect any variables but breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since no loop or if statement is mentioned, we assume this is outside of any such constructs. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nk` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `lst1` is a non-empty set containing the unique elements from the original list of integers, `i` is the third element in `lst1`, the console displays 'YES', and the output of the print statement is `1` followed by `i`.**
