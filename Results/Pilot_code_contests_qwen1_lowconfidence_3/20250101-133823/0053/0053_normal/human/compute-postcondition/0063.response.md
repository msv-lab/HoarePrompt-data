The code snippet `lst1 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the results in a list named `lst1`. The variables `nk`, `n`, and `m` are not affected by this code.

Let's assume the user inputs a sequence of integers separated by spaces when prompted. For example, if the user inputs "3 4 5", the list `lst1` will be `[3, 4, 5]`.

Output State: **`nk` is either 0 or 1; `n` is an integer from the input; `m` is an integer from the input; `lst1` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
