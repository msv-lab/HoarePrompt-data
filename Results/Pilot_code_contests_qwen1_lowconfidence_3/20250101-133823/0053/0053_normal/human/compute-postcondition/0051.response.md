Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nk` is 1
   - `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list with at least one element
   - `lst2` is a set of integers from the input
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `m` is an input integer
   - The value of `i` is the next element in `lst1`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `lst1`.
   - The loop body is omitted but we know it checks if `i` is in `lst2`. If `i` is in `lst2`, the loop or conditional block is exited. Otherwise, the block does nothing and the original values of `i` remain unchanged.

3. **For the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - For the loop to execute again, the next element `i` in `lst1` must not be in `lst2`.
   - Since `lst1` contains unique elements, we move to the next element in `lst1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `nk` remains the same as no changes are expected based on the given conditions.
   - `lst1` loses the current `i` (the element checked in the previous iteration) and moves to the next unique element.
   - `lst2` remains the same as no changes are expected.
   - `n` and `m` remain the same as they are not involved in the loop condition.
   - `i` is updated to the next element in `lst1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `lst1` now contains all elements except the one that was checked in the previous iteration.
- `i` is the next element in `lst1`.

State: **`nk` is 1, `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list excluding the last checked element, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and the value of `i` is the next element in `lst1`.**
