The code `lst2 = set(lst2)` converts the list `lst2` into a set, which removes any duplicate elements from `lst2`. Since `lst2` was originally a list of integers, converting it to a set means that `lst2` now contains only unique integers. The other variables (`nk`, `n`, `m`, and `lst1`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`nk` is 0; `n` is an integer from the input; `m` is an integer from the input; `lst1` is a set containing the unique elements from the original list of integers; `lst2` is a set of integers obtained from the input.**
