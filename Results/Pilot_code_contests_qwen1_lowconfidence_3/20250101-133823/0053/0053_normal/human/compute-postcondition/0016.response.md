The code `print('YES')` prints the string 'YES' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `nk`, `lst1`, and `lst2`. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`nk` is 0, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input**
