The code sets `nk` to 0. The value of `nk` is now explicitly set to 0. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `lst1`, `lst2`) are not affected.

Output State: **`nk` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `lst1` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lst2` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
