According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the set `lst1`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states hold:

- `nk` is 1 (which suggests this might be a counter or flag, but its exact role isn't specified)
- `n` is an integer from the input (unchanged from the previous iteration)
- `m` is an integer from the input (unchanged from the previous iteration)
- `lst1` is a non-empty set containing the unique elements from the original list of integers (unchanged from the previous iteration)
- `i` is the first element in `lst1` (since it has completed one full iteration)

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in `lst1`.

Given these points, we need to update the state to reflect the next element being processed in the loop.

State: **`nk` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `lst1` is a non-empty set containing the unique elements from the original list of integers, `i` is the second element in `lst1`**
