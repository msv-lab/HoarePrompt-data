Output State: **`nk` is 1, `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and if any element in `lst1` was found in `lst2`, the console prints 'YES' and the index (1-based) and the value of the matching element. If no such element is found, `nk` remains 0, `lst1` remains unchanged, and no output is printed.**
