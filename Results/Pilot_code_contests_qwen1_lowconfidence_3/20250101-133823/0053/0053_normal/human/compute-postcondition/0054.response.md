The code `nk = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `nk`. This updates the value of `nk` but does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`nk` is 1, `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list excluding the last checked element, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and the value of `i` is the next element in `lst1`. Printed output is 'YES'**.
