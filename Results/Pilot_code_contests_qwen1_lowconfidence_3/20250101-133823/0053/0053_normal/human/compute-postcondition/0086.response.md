Postcondition: ***`nk` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `lst1` is a non-empty set containing the unique elements from the original list of integers, `i` is the third element in `lst1`, the console displays 'YES' if `i` is in `lst2`, and the output of the print statement is `1` followed by `i` if `i` is in `lst2`. If `i` is not in `lst2`, no additional changes occur to the variables and the console displays nothing new besides the initial '1' and `i`.***
