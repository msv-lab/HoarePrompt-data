According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `lst1`. The loop will execute if `lst1` contains at least one element. Before the loop starts, `nk` is 0 and `lst1` is a set of integers from the input. 

To ensure the loop can execute, `lst1` must contain at least one integer.

State: **`nk` is 0, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input**
