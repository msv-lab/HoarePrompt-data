The code simply prints 'YES', which does not affect any variable values. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`nk` is 1, `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list excluding the last checked element, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and the value of `i` is the next element in `lst1`. Printed output is 'YES'**
