The code splits the input into two integers and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This affects `n` and `m`, while `nk`, `lst1`, `lst2`, and the print statement remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nk` is 0, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, and `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**
