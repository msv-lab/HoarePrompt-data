The `break` statement is used to exit the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. In this case, it is inside a loop or conditional block where `i` is being checked against `lst2`. Since the exact block is not specified, we assume it is within a loop that iterates over elements in `lst2` and breaks when a condition is met.

The initial state includes:
- `nk` is 1
- `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list with at least one element
- `lst2` is a set of integers from the input
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- The current value of `i` is in `lst2`
- The console prints '1', `i`.

Since the `break` statement is executed, the loop or conditional block is exited without further updates to the variables. The variables `nk`, `lst1`, `lst2`, `n`, `m`, and `i` retain their initial values, and the console print operation is executed once before the break.

Output State: **`nk` is 1, `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list with at least one element, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, the current value of `i` is in `lst2`, and the console prints '1', `i`.**
