Postcondition: **`nk` is 1, `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and since `nk` is 0, the program does not print anything and remains in the if condition checking for any element in `lst1` that matches an element in `lst2`.**
