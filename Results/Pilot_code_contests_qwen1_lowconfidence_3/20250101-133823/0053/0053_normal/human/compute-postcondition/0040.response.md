The code `print('YES')` does not affect any variables. It simply prints 'YES' to the console. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nk` is 0, `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list with at least one element, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and the current value of `i` is in `lst2`. The console prints 'YES'**
