The code prints the value `1` followed by the value of `i`. However, the value of `i` itself is not updated by this print statement. The states of the other variables (`nk`, `lst1`, and `lst2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nk` is 0, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, and the current value of `i` is printed as 1, i.e., `i` remains in `lst2`.**
