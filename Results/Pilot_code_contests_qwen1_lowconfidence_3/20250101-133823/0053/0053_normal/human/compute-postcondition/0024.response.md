The code sets `nk` to 1. The initial state of `nk` being either 0 or 1 is now fixed to 1. The other variables (`lst1`, which must have at least one integer, and the program's output) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nk` is 1; `lst1` must have at least one integer; the program outputs 'YES' and then prints '1' followed by an unknown value `i`.

Output State: **`nk` is 1; `lst1` must have at least one integer; the program outputs 'YES' and then prints '1' followed by an unknown value `i`.**
