Postcondition: ***`nk` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `lst1` is a non-empty set containing the unique elements from the original list of integers, `i` is the second element in `lst1`, and the console displays '1' and the second element of `lst1`. If `i` is in `lst2`, the function continues with the display of '1' and `i`. If `i` is not in `lst2`, the function does not perform any additional actions related to `lst2`.***
