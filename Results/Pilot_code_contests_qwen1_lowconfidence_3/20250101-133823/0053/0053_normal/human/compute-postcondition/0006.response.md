The code snippet converts `lst1` into a set, which removes any duplicate elements in the list. The initial state shows that `nk` is 0, `lst1` is a list of integers, and `lst2` is a list of integers. After executing the line `lst1 = set(lst1)`, `lst1` will be a set containing the unique elements from the original list.

Output State: **`nk` is 0, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input, `lst2` is a list of integers from the input**
