`n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers. The value of `nk` remains unchanged as the input for the loop is processed but does not affect the value of `nk`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nk` is either 0 or 1; `n` is an integer from the input; `m` is an integer from the input.

Output State: **`nk` is either 0 or 1; `n` is an integer from the input; `m` is an integer from the input**
