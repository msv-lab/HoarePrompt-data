Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two arrays of integers. For each test case, it reads the lengths of the two arrays, `n` and `m`, followed by the elements of the arrays. It then checks if there is any common element between the two arrays. If a common element is found, the function prints 'YES' along with the 1-based index and the value of the matching element. If no common element is found, the function prints 'NO'. The function ensures that the sum of the lengths of the arrays across all test cases does not exceed 1000.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If either `n` or `m` is zero, the function still processes the test case correctly.
- If both arrays are empty, the function will print 'NO'.
- The function handles up to 1000 test cases, and the total length of all arrays combined does not exceed 1000.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not return any value; it only prints the result directly.
