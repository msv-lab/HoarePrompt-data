The provided code snippet is a lambda function definition for `input`, which simply reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. This does not perform any calculations or assignments. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, each test case consists of three lines with n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000), followed by n integers for the first array and m integers for the second array, and the input function is defined as a lambda that reads a line and strips whitespace.**
