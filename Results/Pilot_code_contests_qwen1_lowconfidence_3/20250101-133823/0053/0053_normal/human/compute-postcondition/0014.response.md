Postcondition: ***`nk` is 0, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input. If `i` is found in `lst2`, `nk` becomes 1 and the current value of `i` is printed as 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not found in `lst2`, no changes occur to `nk`, `lst1`, or `lst2`, and the program continues execution as usual.***
