The code `lst2 = set(lst2)` converts the list `lst2` into a set. Since `lst2` was initially a list of integers from the input, after executing this line, `lst2` will no longer be a list but a set containing the same elements. The set will remove any duplicate elements that might have been present in the original list.

Output State: **`nk` is 0; `lst1` is a set of integers from the input; `lst2` is a set of integers from the input**
