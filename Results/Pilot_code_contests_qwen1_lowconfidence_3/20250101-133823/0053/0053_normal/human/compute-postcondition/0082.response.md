The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. It does not affect any of the variables `nk`, `n`, `m`, `lst1`, or `i`. The output to the console is 'YES', but this does not change the values of the variables. 

Output State: **`nk` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `lst1` is a non-empty set containing the unique elements from the original list of integers, `i` is the third element in `lst1`, and the console displays 'YES'.**
