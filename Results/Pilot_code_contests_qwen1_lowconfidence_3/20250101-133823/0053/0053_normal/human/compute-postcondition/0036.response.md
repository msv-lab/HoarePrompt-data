The code `lst1 = set(lst1)` converts the list `lst1` into a set, removing any duplicate elements in `lst1`. The other variables (`nk`, `lst2`, `n`, `m`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `nk` is 0; `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list; `lst2` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer.

Output State: **`nk` is 0; `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list; `lst2` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer**
