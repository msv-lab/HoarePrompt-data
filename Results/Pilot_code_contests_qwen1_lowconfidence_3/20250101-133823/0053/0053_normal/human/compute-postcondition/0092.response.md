The function `func` accepts a single parameter `t`. `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). For each value of `t`, the function processes three lines of input:
- The first line contains two positive integers `n` and `m` such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1000\), representing the lengths of two arrays.
- The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, \ldots, a_n` such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\), representing the elements of the first array.
- The third line contains `m` integers `b_1, \ldots, b_m` such that \(1 \leq b_i \leq 1000\), representing the elements of the second array.

After processing all `t` test cases, the function returns a result based on the inputs provided for each test case. However, since the specific output for each test case is not detailed, we can only state the general input parameters and structure.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, where `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). For each value of `t`, the function processes two integers `n` and `m`, followed by two arrays of integers. The function then returns a result based on the processed inputs.**
