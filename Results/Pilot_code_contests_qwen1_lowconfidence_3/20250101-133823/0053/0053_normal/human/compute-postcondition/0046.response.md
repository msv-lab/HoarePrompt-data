The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console and does not affect any variable values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`nk` is 1, `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list with at least one element, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, the current value of `i` is the next element in `lst1` (i.e., `i + 1` if `i + 1` is still in `lst2`), and the console prints '1' and `i + 1'**
