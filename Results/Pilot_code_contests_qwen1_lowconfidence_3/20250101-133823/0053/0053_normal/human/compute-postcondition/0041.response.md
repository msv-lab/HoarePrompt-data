The code `print(1, i)` prints the integer 1 followed by the value of `i`. Since `i` is currently in `lst2`, the value of `i` remains unchanged, and the print statement executes as expected.

Output State: **`nk` is 0, `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list with at least one element, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, the current value of `i` is in `lst2`, and the console prints '1', `i`.**
