The code creates a list `lst1` by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. This affects the value of `n` and `m`, which are no longer relevant since the input is now split into a list. The output state will include the updated value of `lst1` and indicate that `n` and `m` are no longer applicable.

Output State: **`lst1` is a list of integers from the input, `n` and `m` are no longer applicable**
