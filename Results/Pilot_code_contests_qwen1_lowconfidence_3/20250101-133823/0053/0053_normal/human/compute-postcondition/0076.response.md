The code `print('YES')` simply prints 'YES' to the console without changing any variable values. Therefore, the variables `nk`, `n`, `m`, `lst1`, and `i` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`nk` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `lst1` is a non-empty set containing the unique elements from the original list of integers, `i` is the second element in `lst1`, and the console displays 'YES'**
