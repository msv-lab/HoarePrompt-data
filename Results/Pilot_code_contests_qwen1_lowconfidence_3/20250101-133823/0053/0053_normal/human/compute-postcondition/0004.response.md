`lst2` is assigned a new list created by taking the input, splitting it into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer. The original list `lst1` remains unchanged, and the variables `n` and `m` are no longer applicable. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `lst2` and retains the state of `lst1`.

Output State: **`lst1` is a list of integers from the input, `lst2` is a list of integers from the input**
