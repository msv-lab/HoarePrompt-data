`nk` is assigned the value `1`. The values of `lst1`, `lst2`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and the printed values are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nk` is 1, `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list with at least one element, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, the current value of `i` is in `lst2`, and the console prints '1', `i`.
