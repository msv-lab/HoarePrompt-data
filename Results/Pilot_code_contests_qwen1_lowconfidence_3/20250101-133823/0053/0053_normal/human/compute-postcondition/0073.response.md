The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates the exit from a loop or the most internal nested structure. In this case, since there is no loop or nested structure that `break` would affect, the only thing that happens is that the program exits the hypothetical loop or structure it was in. 

Given the initial state and the fact that `break` is executed without affecting any variables:

- `nk` is 1
- `n` is an integer from the input
- `m` is an integer from the input
- `lst1` is a non-empty set containing the unique elements from the original list of integers
- `i` is the first element in `lst1`
- 'YES' is printed to the console

The `break` statement does not alter these states. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nk` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `lst1` is a non-empty set containing the unique elements from the original list of integers, `i` is the first element in `lst1`, and 'YES' is printed to the console.**
