The code `nk = 1` does not change the value of `nk` which is already 1 in the initial state. The values of `n`, `m`, `lst1`, and `i` remain unchanged as well. The console displays '1' and the second element of `lst1`, which means `i` is the second element in `lst1`.

Output State: **`nk` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `lst1` is a non-empty set containing the unique elements from the original list of integers, the console displays '1' and the second element of `lst1`, `i` is the second element in `lst1`**
