The code `nk = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `nk`. The values of the lists `lst1` and `lst2` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nk` is 0, `lst1` is a list of integers from the input, `lst2` is a list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`nk` is 0, `lst1` is a list of integers from the input, `lst2` is a list of integers from the input**
