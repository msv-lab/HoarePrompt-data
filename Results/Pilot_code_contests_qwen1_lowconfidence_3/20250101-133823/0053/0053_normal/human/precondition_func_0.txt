t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, representing the lengths of two arrays; the second line contains n integers a_1, …, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, representing the elements of the first array; the third line contains m integers b_1, …, b_m such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 1000, representing the elements of the second array. It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 1000 (∑_{i=1}^t n_i, ∑_{i=1}^t m_i ≤ 1000).
