You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two arrays of integers a_1,…,a_n and b_1,…,b_m.

Your task is to find a non-empty array c_1,…,c_k that is a subsequence of a_1,…,a_n, and also a subsequence of b_1,…,b_m. If there are multiple answers, find one of the smallest possible length. If there are still multiple of the smallest possible length, find any. If there are no such arrays, you should report about it.

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero) elements. For example, [3,1] is a subsequence of [3,2,1] and [4,3,1], but not a subsequence of [1,3,3,7] and [3,10,4].

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Next 3t lines contain descriptions of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1≤ n,m≤ 1000) — the lengths of the two arrays.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,…,a_n (1≤ a_i≤ 1000) — the elements of the first array.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1,…,b_m (1≤ b_i≤ 1000) — the elements of the second array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 1000 (∑_{i=1}^t n_i, ∑_{i=1}^t m_i≤ 1000).

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if a solution exists, or "NO" otherwise.

If the answer is "YES", on the next line output an integer k (1≤ k≤ 1000) — the length of the array, followed by k integers c_1,…,c_k (1≤ c_i≤ 1000) — the elements of the array.

If there are multiple solutions with the smallest possible k, output any.

1 2 3 4 5


Output


YES
1 4
YES
1 3
NO
YES
1 3
YES
1 2

Note

In the first test case, [4] is a subsequence of [10, 8, 6, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. This array has length 1, it is the smallest possible length of a subsequence of both a and b.

In the third test case, no non-empty subsequences of both [3] and [2] exist, so the answer is "NO".
Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    input = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        lst1 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        lst2 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        nk = 0
        lst1 = set(lst1)
        lst2 = set(lst2)
        for i in lst1:
            if i in lst2:
                print('YES')
                print(1, i)
                nk = 1
                break
        if nk == 0:
            print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle cases where the intersection of the two lists is empty. Specifically, it checks if there is at least one common element between the two sets `lst1` and `lst2`. However, this approach is incomplete because it does not account for cases where the intersection is empty, even though a subsequence might still exist.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
2
4 5
10 8 6 4
1 2 3 4 5
5 3
1000 2 2 2 3
3 1 5
```

- For the first test case, the program will correctly identify that the number 4 is a common element and will output "YES" with the subsequence [4].
- However, for the second test case, the program will incorrectly output "NO" because there are no common elements in the sets formed from the lists [1000, 2, 2, 2, 3] and [3, 1, 5].

To fix this, the program needs to check for the existence of a common subsequence, not just a common element. This can be done by generating all subsequences of one list and checking if they are also subsequences of the other list, but this approach is computationally expensive for large inputs. A more efficient approach would be to use dynamic programming to find the longest common subsequence (LCS), which can handle the problem constraints effectively.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two arrays of integers. For each test case, it reads the lengths of the two arrays, `n` and `m`, followed by the elements of the arrays. It then checks if there is any common element between the two arrays. If a common element is found, the function prints 'YES' along with the 1-based index and the value of the matching element. If no common element is found, the function prints 'NO'. The function ensures that the sum of the lengths of the arrays across all test cases does not exceed 1000.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
