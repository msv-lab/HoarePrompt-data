Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code only checks for the existence of a common element between the two arrays and does not consider subsequences. According to the problem description, the goal is to find a non-empty subsequence that is common to both arrays, not just a common element.

For example, consider the following test case:

```
Input:
2
4 5
10 8 6 4
1 2 3 4 5
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 6
```

The expected output would be:
```
YES
1 4
NO
```

However, the provided code would output:
```
YES
1 4
YES
1 1
```

This is because the code only checks for the presence of common elements and does not verify if they form a subsequence in both arrays. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
