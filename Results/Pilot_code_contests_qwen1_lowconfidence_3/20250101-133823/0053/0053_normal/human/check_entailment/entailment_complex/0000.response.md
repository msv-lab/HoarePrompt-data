Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the problem description requires the program to find a non-empty subsequence that is common to both arrays. However, the current implementation attempts to find a common element (not necessarily a subsequence) between the two arrays, which is not sufficient.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Subsequence Requirement**: The problem description specifies that the common sequence should be a subsequence of both arrays. A subsequence means that elements can be skipped but their order must be preserved. The current program simply finds a common element, which may or may not preserve the order of elements.

2. **Non-Empty Subsequence**: The problem description explicitly mentions that the result should be a non-empty subsequence. The current implementation prints "YES" even if the common element is the entire array, which doesn't guarantee the smallest possible subsequence length.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to:
- Check for the existence of a non-empty subsequence that is common to both arrays.
- If such a subsequence exists, find the smallest possible subsequence and print it.
- If no such subsequence exists, print "NO".

The current implementation only checks for the presence of a single common element and does not ensure that the subsequence requirement is met. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.
