Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to find a non-empty subsequence that is common to both arrays. The code checks for common elements between the two sets of integers and prints "YES" along with the first common element if found. However, this approach is insufficient because:

1. The code assumes that the first common element found is the shortest possible subsequence, which is not necessarily true. For example, consider the arrays [1, 2, 3, 4] and [3, 4, 5, 6]. The first common element is 3, but the longest common subsequence could be [3, 4].
2. The code does not handle cases where the arrays do not share any common elements, and instead of printing "NO", it incorrectly prints the first element of the first array if it matches an element in the second array.
3. The code does not guarantee that the output subsequence is the shortest possible one. For instance, for the arrays [1, 2, 3, 4] and [3, 4, 5, 6], the code would print "YES" and "1 3", whereas the correct output should be "YES" and "2 3 4".

To fix this, the code needs to implement a more comprehensive approach to finding the longest common subsequence, such as dynamic programming or a more detailed iterative check.
