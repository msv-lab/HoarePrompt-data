Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies whether there exists a non-empty common subsequence between two arrays `lst1` and `lst2`. It does this by converting both lists into sets and checking for common elements. If a common element is found, it prints "YES" along with the element. If no common elements are found after checking all elements, it prints "NO".

Here's a breakdown of why the program works for all potential cases:

1. **Common Subsequence Check**: The program uses sets to efficiently check for common elements between the two lists. Sets automatically handle duplicates, ensuring that only unique elements are considered.

2. **Output Format**: The program outputs "YES" followed by the first common element if one is found. If no common element is found, it outputs "NO". This matches the problem description exactly.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty Common Subsequence**: The program correctly handles the case where there are no common elements, printing "NO".
   - **Single Element Common Subsequence**: The program correctly identifies and outputs a single-element common subsequence if one exists.
   - **Multiple Common Elements**: While the program only outputs the first common element it finds, this satisfies the requirement of finding any common subsequence of minimal length.

Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all potential cases without error, the correctness is **True**.
