Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to handle the requirement of finding the smallest possible length of the common subsequence when there are multiple valid solutions. Let's analyze why:

1. **Single Match Found Early Exit**: The program checks for the presence of any common element between the two sets (`lst1` and `lst2`) using a single loop. If it finds a common element, it immediately prints "YES" and the length 1 along with the element. However, this approach does not guarantee that the found subsequence is the shortest possible one among all valid subsequences.

2. **Multiple Valid Solutions Handling**: The problem description states that if there are multiple answers of the smallest possible length, the program should find any of them. The current implementation only checks for the existence of at least one common element without considering other potential common subsequences of the same minimum length.

3. **Example to Illustrate the Issue**:
   - Consider the following input:
     ```
     2
     4 5
     1 2 3 4
     3 2 1 4 5
     1 1
     3
     3
     ```
   - The expected output would be:
     ```
     YES
     2 1 4
     NO
     ```
   - However, the current program would output:
     ```
     YES
     1 4
     NO
     ```
   - Here, the subsequence `[1, 4]` is the shortest common subsequence, but the program only outputs a single element `4`.

To correctly implement the required functionality, the program needs to:
- Check for the presence of common elements and store them in a list.
- Determine the length of the shortest common subsequence among all common elements.
- Print the shortest common subsequence found.

Here's an example of how the program could be modified to achieve the desired behavior:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    input = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        lst1 = set([int(i) for i in input().split()])
        lst2 = set([int(i) for i in input().split()])
        
        common_elements = lst1.intersection(lst2)
        
        if common_elements:
            min_length = float('inf')
            result = []
            for element in common_elements:
                # Generate all subsequences starting with the current element
                subsequence = [element]
                while True:
                    found = False
                    for i in range(len(subsequence) + 1):
                        new_subsequence = subsequence[:i] + [element] + subsequence[i:]
                        if set(new_subsequence).issubset(lst1) and set(new_subsequence).issubset(lst2):
                            subsequence = new_subsequence
                            found = True
                    if not found:
                        break
                if len(subsequence) < min_length:
                    min_length = len(subsequence)
                    result = subsequence
            
            print("YES")
            print(min_length, *result)
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

This modification ensures that the program finds and prints the shortest common subsequence, thus adhering to the problem description.
