Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. Let's review the key points:

1. **Graph Representation and Construction**:
   - The program correctly constructs the graph using adjacency lists, where each room points to the rooms it is directly connected to. This is done in `func_2()` where the graph is built from the input passages.

2. **Finding the Optimal Signposts**:
   - The function `func_1()` performs a BFS to find the shortest path distances from Room 1 to all other rooms. It updates the `post` array with the room that leads to the shortest path to Room 1. This is correctly implemented as shown in the annotated code.

3. **Validation of the Solution**:
   - After computing the `post` array, the program checks if any room has a signpost pointing to a room that is not part of the shortest path to Room 1. If such a case is found, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes" followed by the signposts for each room, indicating that the solution satisfies the problem requirements.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The function `func_3()` handles printing the results correctly. It ensures that the output format matches the problem description.

Based on the annotations and the problem description, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It constructs the graph, finds the shortest paths, and ensures that following the signposts leads to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
