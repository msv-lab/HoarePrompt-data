Final: **True**

### Reasoning:
The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides clear insights into the state of the program at various points, confirming that the program logic aligns with the problem requirements.

1. **Graph Construction**: The `func_2` function correctly constructs the adjacency list representation of the graph from the input. This is evident from the nested loops that add bi-directional edges to the graph.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: The `func_1` function performs a DFS to find the shortest paths from Room 1 to all other rooms. The `post` array stores the parent (signpost) for each room, ensuring that moving from any room to the signpost will eventually lead to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps.

3. **Output Handling**: The `func_3` function prints the results correctly. If the `post` array contains `-1`, indicating an invalid path, the program prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes" followed by the signpost values for each room.

4. **Annotations Support**: The annotations confirm that the program maintains the necessary states throughout its execution, such as the `used` list for tracking visited nodes, the `depth` list for storing the shortest distances, and the `post` list for storing the signposts. These annotations show that the logic is sound and follows the problem's requirements.

Given these points, the program correctly places signposts in the rooms to ensure that starting from any room (except Room 1), repeatedly moving according to the signpost will lead to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
