Final: **True**

### Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment appears to be accurate. Here is a detailed breakdown of the analysis:

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - The `func_2` function correctly constructs the graph using the input values of `n` and `m`. It builds a bidirectional graph where each room is connected to the rooms it should be connected to.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS) Traversal**:
   - The `func_1` function performs a DFS traversal starting from Room 1 (node 0). It correctly updates the `depth` and `post` arrays to ensure that each node's `post` value represents the last node processed in the DFS traversal rooted at the starting node. This ensures that the path to Room 1 is the shortest.

3. **Signpost Placement**:
   - After the DFS traversal, the `func_2` function checks if any `post` value is `-1`, which indicates that the graph is not fully connected. If any `post` value is `-1`, the program correctly outputs `No`. Otherwise, it outputs `Yes` followed by the correct signpost values, ensuring that starting from any room (except Room 1) and following the signpost will lead to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The `func_3` function handles the printing of the results correctly. It outputs the required `Yes` and `No` messages and the correct signpost values as described.

Given these observations and the annotations, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It constructs the graph, performs the necessary DFS traversal, and places the signposts in such a way that they lead to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps for each room. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
