Final: **True**

Reasoning:
Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Graph Construction**: The program correctly constructs an undirected graph using adjacency lists. Each room is connected to the rooms it is directly linked to by passages.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Implementation**: The `func_1` function performs a BFS starting from Room 1 (node 0). It calculates the shortest path to Room 1 for each room and sets the signpost in each room to point to the room that leads to the shortest path to Room 1. The BFS ensures that the shortest paths are correctly computed.

3. **Signpost Placement**: After the BFS, the `func_2` function checks if any room (except Room 1) has a signpost that leads to a room which is not part of the shortest path to Room 1. If such a case is found, it prints "No" and exits. Otherwise, it prints "Yes" followed by the signposts for each room.

4. **Output Handling**: The `func_3` function handles the printing of the results in a generic manner, ensuring that the output format matches the problem requirements.

Given the annotations and the original assessment, the program meets the problem description and the provided constraints. The BFS algorithm ensures that the signposts are placed correctly to ensure that starting from any room (except Room 1), following the signposts will lead to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps. The program handles all edge cases correctly and produces the expected output.

Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as **True**.
