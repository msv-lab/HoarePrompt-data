Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the requirement to ensure that starting from any room (except Room 1) and following the signposts will lead to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps. Specifically, the code uses a depth-first search (DFS) to determine the shortest path from Room 1 to other rooms, but it does not guarantee that following the signposts from any room will lead to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps.

The function `func_1` performs a DFS and returns the last node processed in the DFS traversal from Room 1, which does not necessarily indicate the shortest path from any room to Room 1. This function is used in `func_2` to determine if the graph is fully connected, but it does not ensure that the signposts placed according to the returned values will satisfy the condition that starting from any room and following the signposts will lead to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps.

To correctly solve the problem, the algorithm should identify the shortest paths from each room to Room 1 and set the signpost in each room to point to the room that leads to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps. The current implementation does not achieve this.
