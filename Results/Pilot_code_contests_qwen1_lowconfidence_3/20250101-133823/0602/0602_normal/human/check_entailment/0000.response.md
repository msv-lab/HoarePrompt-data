Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Graph Construction**: The program constructs an adjacency list representation of the cave's rooms and passages. This is done correctly by iterating over the edges and adding them to the corresponding room lists.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: The `func_1` function performs a DFS to find the shortest path from Room 1 to all other rooms. It keeps track of the parent (room) for each room, effectively constructing a tree where the root is Room 1. This ensures that the path taken from any room back to Room 1 is the shortest.

3. **Signpost Placement**: After constructing the tree, the `func_2` function places the signposts in each room (except Room 1). Each signpost points to the room that would lead to Room 1 with the minimum number of passages. This is done using the `post` array returned by `func_1`.

4. **Output Handling**: The `func_3` function handles printing the results. It checks if there was a valid path from all rooms to Room 1 and prints "No" if not. Otherwise, it prints "Yes" followed by the correct signpost values.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach ensures that starting from any room (except Room 1), repeatedly moving according to the signpost will eventually lead to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps. Since the provided code correctly implements this logic, it satisfies the problem requirements for all potential cases.

Thus, the program is correct.
