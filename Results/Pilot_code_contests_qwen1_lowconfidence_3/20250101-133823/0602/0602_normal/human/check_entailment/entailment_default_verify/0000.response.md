Final: **True**

### Reasoning:
Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment of the program's correctness appears to be accurate. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Graph Construction**: The program correctly constructs the adjacency list representation of the cave's rooms and passages. This part is handled by `func_2`, which reads the input and populates the graph.

2. **DFS for Shortest Path**: The `func_1` function uses a depth-first search (DFS) to find the shortest paths from Room 1 to all other rooms. This ensures that each room (except Room 1) has a signpost pointing to the room that leads to Room 1 with the minimum number of passages. This is a critical step in ensuring that the program meets the problem's requirements.

3. **Signpost Placement**: The `func_2` function places the signposts in each room (except Room 1) based on the result of `func_1`. If the `post` array indicates that there is no valid path to Room 1 from a particular room, the program correctly prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes" followed by the appropriate signpost values.

4. **Output Handling**: The `func_3` function handles the printing of the results. According to the output hints, `func_3` correctly prints the values to the specified output stream using the specified separator and end string. This part of the code does not affect the correctness of the solution since the primary requirement is to ensure that the signpost placements are correct.

Given these points, the program correctly identifies whether a valid placement of signposts exists and prints the necessary output. The output hints confirm that the `func_3` function behaves as expected, further supporting the correctness of the overall program.

Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
