Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Graph Representation**: 
   - The program constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph using `graph`, where `graph[i]` contains the indices of rooms directly connected to Room `i+1` by a passage.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - The function `func_1(graph, start)` performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from `start` (which corresponds to Room 1 in the problem context). It calculates the shortest path distances (`depth`) and the last vertex processed in the DFS traversal (`post`) for each node.
   - The `post` array stores the last vertex processed in the DFS traversal for each node. This ensures that each node (except Room 1) points to the room that leads back to Room 1 in the shortest path.

3. **Validation and Output**:
   - After computing the `post` array, the program checks if `-1` is present in `post`. If it is, it means there is no valid way to place the signposts such that the objective is met, and it prints "No".
   - If `-1` is not present, it prints "Yes" followed by the sequence of rooms indicating the signposts.

4. **Handling of Constraints and Requirements**:
   - The program handles the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement:
     - It processes all rooms and passages correctly.
     - It ensures that the signpost in each room (except Room 1) points to a room that, when followed, eventually leads back to Room 1.
     - It correctly handles the bidirectional nature of passages by ensuring that both ends of each passage are accounted for.

### Summary:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to determine and place the signposts according to the problem description. It ensures that each room (except Room 1) points to a room that leads back to Room 1 in the shortest path, and it handles all cases as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
