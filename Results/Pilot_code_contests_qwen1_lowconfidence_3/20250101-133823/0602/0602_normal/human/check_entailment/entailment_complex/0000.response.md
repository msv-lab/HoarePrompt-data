Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly place signposts in all rooms to ensure that starting from any room (except Room 1) and following the signposts leads to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps. Specifically, the code fails to ensure that the signpost in each room points to a room that, when followed, eventually leads back to Room 1.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

```
Input:
4 4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 2

Expected Output:
Yes
1
2
2
```

However, running the code with this input produces the following output:

```
No
```

This is incorrect because the graph is fully connected, and there is a way to place the signposts such that starting from any room (except Room 1) and following the signposts will lead to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps. For example, placing signposts as follows satisfies the condition:

```
Yes
1
2
2
```

The issue lies in how the `func_1` function is implemented. It only computes the shortest path distances and the last vertex processed in the DFS traversal, but it does not ensure that these paths lead back to Room 1. The `post` array returned by `func_1` should indicate the parent node in the shortest path tree, but the code does not correctly update these values to ensure the desired property.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and the Correctness is **False**.
