Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` and how it is used in `func_2` do not ensure that the conditions of the problem are met. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) and updates the `depth` and `post` arrays. However, it does not ensure that all rooms are reachable from Room 1. The `post` array returned by this function only indicates the last visited node in the DFS traversal, which is not sufficient to ensure that the signposts will lead to Room 1.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function uses the output of `func_1` to determine if the graph is fully connected. If there is any `-1` in the `post` array, it prints "No". However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for the specific requirement that starting from any room (except Room 1) and following the signposts should lead to Room 1 with the minimum number of passages.

3. **Example Case**: Consider a simple graph with 4 rooms and 3 passages:
   ```
   4 3
   1 2
   2 3
   3 4
   ```
   - Using `func_1`, the `post` array might indicate that starting from Room 1, the sequence is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2, but this does not ensure that following the signposts from Room 4 leads back to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps.

To correctly solve the problem, one should perform a topological sort or a BFS/DFS to ensure that each room's signpost points to a room that eventually leads back to Room 1. The current implementation does not guarantee this property, hence the code is incorrect.
