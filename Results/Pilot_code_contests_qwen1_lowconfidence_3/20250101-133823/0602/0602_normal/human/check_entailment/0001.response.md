Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Graph Representation**: The program correctly constructs the graph using adjacency lists, where each room points to the rooms it is directly connected to.

2. **Finding Post-Order Values**: The function `func_1` uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the minimum distance to Room 1 for each room. It then uses this information to determine the optimal signpost for each room. The signpost for each room `i` (except Room 1) is set to the room that leads to the shortest path to Room 1.

3. **Output Handling**: The program checks if any room has a signpost that leads to a room which is not part of the shortest path to Room 1. If such a case is found, it prints "No" and exits. Otherwise, it prints "Yes" followed by the signposts for each room.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the provided implementation seems to handle all potential cases correctly. It ensures that starting from any room (except Room 1), following the signposts will lead to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for all inputs and potential cases, making it correct.
