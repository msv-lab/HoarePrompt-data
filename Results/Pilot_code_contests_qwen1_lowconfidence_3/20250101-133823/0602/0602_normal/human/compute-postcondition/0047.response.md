Postcondition: ***`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, and `w` is a vertex such that the depth of `w` is not -1 and either the depth of `w` is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1. If `used[w]` is `False`, no change is made to the values of `depth[v]` and `post[v]`. If `used[w]` is `True`, `q` is a list containing `w`, and `depth[v]` is set to `depth[w] + 1` if `depth[w]` is not -1 and either `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is -1, otherwise no change is made to `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remains unchanged.***
