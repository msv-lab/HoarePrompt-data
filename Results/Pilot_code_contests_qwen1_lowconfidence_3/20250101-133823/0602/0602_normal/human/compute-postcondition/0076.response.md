Postcondition: ***`graph[v]` contains at least two elements, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `q` now contains at least one vertex plus `w`, `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1`, `post[v]` is now equal to `w`, and `used[w]` is `True`.***

Explanation:
- The if condition checks if `depth[w]` is not `-1` and either `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is `-1`.
- If the condition is true, `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1`.
- There is no else part, so if the condition is false, no additional changes are made to the variables.

Since there is no else part and the condition always leads to updating `depth[v]` to `depth[w] + 1` under the specified circumstances, the overall postcondition focuses on this update and the other variables remaining as described in the if part.
