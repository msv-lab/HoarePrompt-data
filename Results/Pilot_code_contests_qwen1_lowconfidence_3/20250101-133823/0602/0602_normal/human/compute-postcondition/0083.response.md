The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `graph`, which is a list of lists representing an undirected graph where `graph[i]` contains all the indices of nodes connected to node `i`, and `start`, which is an integer representing the starting node and is 0 (Room 1 in the problem context). The function returns the last vertex processed in the DFS traversal rooted at `v` (post[v]). 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a graph represented as a list of lists and a starting node, and return the last vertex processed in the DFS traversal starting from the given node. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a graph represented as a list of lists and a starting node, and returns the last vertex processed in the DFS traversal starting from the given node.**
