The code `file.flush()` flushes the write buffer of the file object `file`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables (`args`, `at_start`, `kwargs`). Therefore, the only change is that the file buffer is flushed.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty list, the file contains the concatenation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, `at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'`, and the result of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`; the file buffer is flushed.**
