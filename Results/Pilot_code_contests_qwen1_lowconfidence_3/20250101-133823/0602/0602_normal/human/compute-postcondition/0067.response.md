`depth[v]` is updated to be equal to `depth[w] + 1`. The value of `depth[w]` is known from the initial state, but the exact value is not specified. The value of `depth[v]` is now updated based on this. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `q` now contains at least one vertex plus `w`, `w` is the second element of `graph[v]` (if it exists), `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1`, `post[v]` is the same as before, and `used[w]` is `True` if `w` is processed again.**
