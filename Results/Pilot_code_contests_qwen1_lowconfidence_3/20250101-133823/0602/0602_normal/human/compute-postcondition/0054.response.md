Postcondition: ***`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `w` is a vertex such that the depth of `w` is not -1 and either the depth of `w` is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1. If `used[w]` is `True` and `depth[w]` is not -1, `depth[v]` is set to `depth[w] + 1` if `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is -1, otherwise `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged. If `used[w]` is `False`, `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged.***
