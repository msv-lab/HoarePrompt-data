The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. This operation does not change the values of `args`, `at_start`, or `sep`. The only change is that `sep` is written to the file.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one element, the file contains 'sep' + str(x), `at_start` is `True`, and `sep` has been written to the file.**
