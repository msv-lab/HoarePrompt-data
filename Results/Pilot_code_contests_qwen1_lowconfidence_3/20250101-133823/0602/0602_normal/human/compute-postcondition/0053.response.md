`q` is a queue, and `append` is used to add an element to the end of the list `q`. In this case, `w` is added to `q`. The depths and post-order values of the vertices remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `w` is a vertex such that the depth of `w` is not -1 and either the depth of `w` is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1, `used[w]` is `True`, `q` contains at least one more element `w`, and `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged.**
