According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop will execute as long as `args` contains at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `args` must contain at least one element, the file contains 'sep' + str(x), and `at_start` is `False`.

To proceed to the next iteration, `args` must still contain at least one element. Additionally, since `x` is the current element being processed in the loop, for the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in `args`. Therefore, `at_start` must be updated to `False` because we are no longer at the start of the loop.

State: **`args` must contain at least one element, the file contains 'sep' + str(x), `at_start` is `True`**
