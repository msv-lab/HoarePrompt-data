The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. Given the initial state, `x` is already written to the file as its string representation, and since `at_start` is `False`, no additional operations are performed in the `if` or `else` part. After writing `str(x)` to the file, the value of `x` remains unchanged, and all other variables (`args`, `at_start`, `sep`) retain their initial states.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least two elements, the file contains 'sep' + str(x) + sep, `at_start` is `False`, `sep` has been written to the file, `x` is written to the file as its string representation.**
