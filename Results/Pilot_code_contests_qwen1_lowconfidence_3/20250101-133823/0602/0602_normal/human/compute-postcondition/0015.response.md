The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. This operation does not affect the values of `args`, `at_start`, or `x`. The file now contains the current content plus `sep`.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least two elements, the file contains 'sep' + str(x) + sep, `at_start` is `False`, `sep` has been written to the file, `x` is written to the file as its string representation**
