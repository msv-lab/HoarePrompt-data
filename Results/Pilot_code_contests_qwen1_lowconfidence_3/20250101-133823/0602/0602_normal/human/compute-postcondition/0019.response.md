Output State: **`args` must be a non-empty list, the file contains the concatenation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, `at_start` is `False`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Conditions and Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in `args`.
   - For the first iteration (`at_start` is `True`), the loop writes `str(x)` directly to the file.
   - For subsequent iterations (`at_start` is `False`), the loop first writes `sep` followed by `str(x)` to the file.

2. **Loop Iterations Analysis:**
   - After the first iteration, `at_start` becomes `False`.
   - For the second iteration, `sep` is written to the file, followed by `str(x)`.
   - For the third iteration, another `sep` is written to the file, followed by `str(x)`, and so on.

3. **Final State:**
   - If `args` contains only one element, the file will contain just that element (no `sep`).
   - If `args` contains more than one element, the file will contain all elements concatenated with `sep` in between.
   - `at_start` will always be `False` after the loop finishes because it is set to `False` after the first iteration and remains `False` for all subsequent iterations.

4. **Case When Loop Does Not Execute:**
   - If `args` is an empty list, the loop does not execute at all.
   - Therefore, `at_start` remains `True`, and the file is unchanged (still contains the initial state, which is nothing).

Thus, the final output state of the loop after all iterations have finished is that `args` must be a non-empty list, the file contains the concatenation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, and `at_start` is `False`.
