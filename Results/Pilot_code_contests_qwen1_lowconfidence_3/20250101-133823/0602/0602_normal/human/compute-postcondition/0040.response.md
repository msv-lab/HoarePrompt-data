Postcondition: ***`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `w` is a vertex such that the depth of `w` is not -1 and either the depth of `w` is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1; if `used[w]` is `False`, then `depth[v]` is set to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is set to `w`; `used[w]` is set to `True` and `q` contains `w`. No changes if `used[w]` is already `True`.***
