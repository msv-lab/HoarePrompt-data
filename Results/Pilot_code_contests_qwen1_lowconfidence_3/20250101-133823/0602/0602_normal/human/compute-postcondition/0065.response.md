Postcondition: ***`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `q` now contains at least one vertex plus `w`, `w` is the first element of `graph[v]`, `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`, if `depth[w]` is not -1 and either `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is -1, then `post[v]` is `w`, otherwise no change occurs to `post[v]`, and `used[w]` is `True`.***
