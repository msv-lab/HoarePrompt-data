The code snippet appends `w` to the list `q`. The variable `q` was not mentioned in the initial state, so it is initialized as a list before this operation. The values of `graph[v]`, `v`, `w`, `used[w]`, `depth[v]`, and `post[v]` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `w` is a vertex such that the depth of `w` is not -1 and either the depth of `w` is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1, and `used[w]` is `True`; `q` is a list containing `w`; `depth[v]` is set to `depth[w] + 1` if `depth[w]` is not -1 and either `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is -1, otherwise no change is made to `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remains unchanged.**
