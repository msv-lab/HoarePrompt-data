Postcondition: ***`args` must contain at least two elements, the file contains 'sep' + str(x) + sep, `at_start` is `False`, `sep` has been written to the file, `x` is written to the file as its string representation. Since the `if` condition `not at_start` is true, no additional operations are performed in the `if` or `else` part, so the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
