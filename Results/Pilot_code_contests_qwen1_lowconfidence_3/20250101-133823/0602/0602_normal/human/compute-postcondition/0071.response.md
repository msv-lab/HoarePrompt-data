The code `q.append(w)` appends the value of `w` to the list `q`. This operation changes the content of `q` by adding `w` to it, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `q` now contains at least one vertex plus `w`, `depth[v]` is updated to either `depth[w] + 1` or remains `-1` if `depth[v]` was initially `-1`, `post[v]` is now equal to `w`, `used[w]` is `True`, `q` now contains the elements of its original content plus `w`.**
