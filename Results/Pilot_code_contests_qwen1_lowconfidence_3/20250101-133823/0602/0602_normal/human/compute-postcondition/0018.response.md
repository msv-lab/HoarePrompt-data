The line `at_start = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `at_start`. This does not affect any other variables or the preconditions provided. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least two elements, the file contains 'sep' + str(x) + sep, `at_start` is `False`, `sep` has been written to the file, `x` is written to the file as its string representation.**
