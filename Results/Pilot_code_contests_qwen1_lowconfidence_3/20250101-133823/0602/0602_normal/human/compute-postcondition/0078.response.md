The code `q.append(w)` appends the element `w` to the list `q`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least two elements, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `q` now contains at least one vertex plus `w`, `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1`, `post[v]` is now equal to `w`, `used[w]` is `True`, `q` now includes `w`.**
