The code sets the value of `depth[v]` to `depth[w] + 1`. Given the initial conditions, `depth[w]` is not -1 and is either less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is -1. Since `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1`, the value of `depth[v]` will be `depth[w] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `q` contains at least one vertex, `w` is the first element of `graph[v]`, `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`, `depth[w]` is not -1 and either `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is -1.**
