The code updates the `depth[v]` to be one more than the `depth[w]`. Given the initial state, `w` is a vertex such that its depth (`depth[w]`) is not -1 and either its depth is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1. Since the depth of `v` is being updated based on the depth of `w`, the depth of `v` will now be `depth[w] + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `w'` is a vertex such that the depth of `w'` is not -1 and either the depth of `w'` is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1, and `used[w']` is `False`, `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`.**
