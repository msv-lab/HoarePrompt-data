Postcondition: ***`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `q` now contains at least one vertex plus `w`, `depth[v]` is updated to either `depth[w] + 1` or remains `-1` if `depth[v]` was initially `-1`, `post[v]` is now equal to `w`, and `used[w]` is `True` if `w` is processed again.***
