`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file, but does not change the value of `sep` itself. The `args` and `at_start` variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one element, and the condition `not at_start` is true; the file writes the value of `sep`**
