Postcondition: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `w` is a vertex such that the depth of `w` is not -1 and either the depth of `w` is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1. The current value of the depth of `w` is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1.**
