`used[w]` is assigned the value `True`. The value of `used[w]` was originally `False`, and now it is set to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `w` is a vertex such that the depth of `w` is not -1 and either the depth of `w` is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1, and `used[w]` is `True`. If `depth[w]` is not -1 and either `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is -1, then `depth[v]` is set to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v] = w`. Otherwise, no change is made to the values of `depth[v]` and `post[v]`.**
