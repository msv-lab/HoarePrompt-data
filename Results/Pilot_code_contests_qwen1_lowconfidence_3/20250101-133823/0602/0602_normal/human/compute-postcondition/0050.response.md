`post[v]` is assigned the value of `w`. The value of `w` is a vertex such that the depth of `w` is not -1 and either the depth of `w` is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1. The value of `v` remains a valid vertex in the graph, and the value of `used[w]` remains `True`. The depth of `v` is updated to `depth[w] + 1`, and `post[v]` is now equal to `w`.

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `w` is a vertex such that the depth of `w` is not -1 and either the depth of `w` is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1, `used[w]` is `True`, `depth[v]` is now `depth[w] + 1`, `post[v]` is `w`.**
