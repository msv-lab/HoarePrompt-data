`q.append(w)` appends the value of `w` to the list `q`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `w` is a vertex such that the depth of `w` is not -1 and either the depth of `w` is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1; `depth[v]` is set to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is set to `w`; `used[w]` is `True`; `q` now contains `w`.
