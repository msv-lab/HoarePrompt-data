The code sets `used[w]` to `True`. This means that the state of `used[w]` changes from whatever its previous state was (either `True` or `False`) to `True`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `w` is a vertex such that the depth of `w` is not -1 and either the depth of `w` is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1, `used[w]` is `True`, and `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged.**
