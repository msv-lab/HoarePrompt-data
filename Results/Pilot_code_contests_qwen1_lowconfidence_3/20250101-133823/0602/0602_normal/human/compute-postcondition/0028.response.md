The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `graph`. `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5. `graph` is a list of lists where `graph[i]` is a list of integers representing the indices of rooms directly connected to Room i+1 by a passage. The function does not return any value.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `graph`, and does not return any value.**
