To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the conditions under which the loop can execute.

### Given Information:
- `args` is a variable-length argument list containing the values to be printed.
- `kwargs` is a dictionary without 'sep' and 'file' keys (or with 'sep' set to ' ' and 'file' set to `sys.stdout` if they existed).
- `sep` is ' ' or a value from `kwargs` if 'sep' existed.
- `file` is `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs` if 'file' existed.
- `at_start` is `True`.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
1. The loop will iterate over each element in `args`.
2. For the loop to execute, `args` must contain at least one element.

### Analysis:
- The loop will only execute if there are elements in `args`. Since `args` is a variable-length argument list, we need to ensure that it contains at least one element.
- The values of `kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, and `at_start` do not directly affect the ability of the loop to execute as long as `args` is not empty.

### Required Adjustments:
- Ensure that `args` is not an empty list. This means `args` should contain at least one element.

### Final Answer:
State: **`args` must contain at least one element**
