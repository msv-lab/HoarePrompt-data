The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. Since `at_start` does not affect the writing operation, the state of `at_start` remains unchanged. The value of `sep` also remains unchanged because the condition for writing `sep` to the file (`at_start` being `False`) is not relevant to this line of code.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one element, the file contains 'sep' + str(x), `at_start` is either `True` or `False`, `sep` has been written to the file if `at_start` was `False`, otherwise it has not been written, `x` is written to the file as its string representation.**
