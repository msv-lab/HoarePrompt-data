Postcondition: ***`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `q` contains at least one vertex, `w` is the first element of `graph[v]`, and `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`. If `depth[w]` is not -1 and either `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is -1, then `post[v]` is `w`. Otherwise, no change occurs to `post[v]`. Additionally, `w` has not been used, i.e., `used[w]` is `False`***
