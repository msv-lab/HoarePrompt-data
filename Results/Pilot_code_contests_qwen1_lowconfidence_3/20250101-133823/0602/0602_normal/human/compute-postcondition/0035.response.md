The code assigns the value of `w` to `post[v]`. Based on the initial state, `graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `w` is a vertex such that the depth of `w` is not -1 and either the depth of `w` is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1; and `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`.

After executing the line `post[v] = w`, the value of `post[v]` is now `w`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `w` is a vertex such that the depth of `w` is not -1 and either the depth of `w` is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1; `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`; `post[v]` is `w`**
