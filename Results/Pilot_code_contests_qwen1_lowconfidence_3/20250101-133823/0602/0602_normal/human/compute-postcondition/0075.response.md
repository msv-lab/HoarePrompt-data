The code `post[v] = w` assigns the value of `w` to `post[v]`. Based on the initial state, `post[v]` was already equal to `w`, so this assignment does not change its value. However, the assignment operation itself confirms that `post[v]` is now explicitly set to `w`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least two elements, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `q` now contains at least one vertex plus `w`, `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1`, `post[v]` is now equal to `w`, and `used[w]` is `True`.**
