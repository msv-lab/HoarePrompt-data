Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads the number of rooms (`n`) and passages (`m`) from standard input, constructs a bidirectional graph representation of the rooms and passages, and then processes the results of `func_1(graph)` to determine whether the graph is fully connected. If `func_1(graph)` returns a list containing `-1`, indicating that the graph is not fully connected, the function calls `func_3('No')` and terminates without further action. Otherwise, it calls `func_3('Yes')` followed by a series of calls to `func_3` for each element in the result of `func_1(graph)`, excluding the first element. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the graph is not fully connected, causing the function to terminate early with `func_3('No')`. The function also assumes that `func_1(graph)` returns a list containing either `-1` or valid node indices, and it does not handle any missing functionality related to the behavior of `func_1` or `func_3`.**
