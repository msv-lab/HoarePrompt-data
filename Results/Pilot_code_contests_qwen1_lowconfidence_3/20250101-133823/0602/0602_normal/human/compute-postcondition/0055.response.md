Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `depth[v]` is the maximum depth among all vertices that can be reached from `v` via an unvisited edge, `post[v]` is the last vertex processed in the DFS subtree rooted at `v`, and `q` contains all vertices reachable from `v` through an unvisited edge. If the loop does not execute, `depth[v]` remains -1, `post[v]` remains its original value, and `q` remains its initial state.**
