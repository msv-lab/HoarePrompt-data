The code `depth[v] = depth[w] + 1` updates the value of `depth[v]` to be the value of `depth[w]` plus 1. Given the initial state where `depth[w]` is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1, the value of `depth[v]` will now be `depth[w] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `w` is a vertex such that the depth of `w` is not -1 and either the depth of `w` is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1; `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`**
