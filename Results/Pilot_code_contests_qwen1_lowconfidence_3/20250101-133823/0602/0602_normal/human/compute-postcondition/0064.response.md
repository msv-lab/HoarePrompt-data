The code appends the value of `w` to the list `q`. This means that `w` is added as a new element at the end of the list `q`.

- The value of `graph[v]` remains unchanged.
- The value of `v` remains unchanged.
- The value of `q` now includes `w` at its end.
- The value of `w` remains unchanged.
- The value of `depth[v]` remains unchanged.
- The value of `depth[w]` remains unchanged.
- The value of `post[v]` remains unchanged based on the condition given.
- The value of `used[w]` remains `True`.

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `q` now contains at least one vertex plus `w`, `w` is the first element of `graph[v]`, `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`, if `depth[w]` is not -1 and either `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is -1, then `post[v]` is `w`, otherwise no change occurs to `post[v]`, and `used[w]` is `True`.**
