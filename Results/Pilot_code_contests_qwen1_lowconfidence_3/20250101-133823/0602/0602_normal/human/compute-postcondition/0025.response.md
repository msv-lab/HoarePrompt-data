Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts a variable-length argument list `args` and a dictionary `kwargs` containing optional keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. It prints the values in `args` to the specified output stream (`sys.stdout` by default) using the specified separator (`' '` by default). After printing, it appends the end string (`'\n'` by default) and flushes the output buffer if requested. The function does not return any value.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is as follows:
- The output stream contains the concatenated values from `args`, separated by the specified separator `sep`.
- The `args` parameter is a non-empty list.
- The `at_start` variable is `False`, indicating that no additional separator is needed for subsequent elements.
- The `kwargs` dictionary no longer contains the keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'.
- If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` was `True`, the output buffer is flushed; otherwise, it remains unchanged.**

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `args` is empty, the function will still attempt to write to the file, but no elements will be printed.
- If `kwargs` contains invalid keys, they are ignored since the code only explicitly pops 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'.
- If `kwargs` contains multiple values for the same key, only the last one is considered due to the use of `pop()` which removes and returns the value associated with the key, and subsequent attempts to pop the same key will fail.
- The function assumes that the provided `file` object supports `write()` and `flush()` methods, though this is not explicitly checked.**
