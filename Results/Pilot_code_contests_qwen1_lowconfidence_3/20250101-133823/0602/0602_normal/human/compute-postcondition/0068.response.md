`post[v]` is assigned the value `w`. The value of `w` is the second element of `graph[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `q` now contains at least one vertex plus `w`, `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1`, `post[v]` is now equal to `w`, and `used[w]` is `True` if `w` is processed again.
