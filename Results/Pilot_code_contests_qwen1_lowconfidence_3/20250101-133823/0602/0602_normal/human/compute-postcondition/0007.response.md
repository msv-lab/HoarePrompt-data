The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` into the file. Since the precondition is that `args` must contain at least one element and the condition `not at_start` is true, the file will write the value of `sep` before writing `x`. However, since the exact value of `sep` is not provided, we will keep it as `sep`.

Other variables and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one element, the file contains 'sep' + str(x), `at_start` remains unchanged**
