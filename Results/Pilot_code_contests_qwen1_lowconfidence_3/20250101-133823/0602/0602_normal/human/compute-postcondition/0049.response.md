The code snippet updates the `depth[v]` to `depth[w] + 1` under certain conditions. Let's analyze the impact:

1. The condition for updating `depth[v]` is that `used[w]` must be `True`, `depth[w]` must not be -1, and either `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is -1.
2. If these conditions are met, `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1`.
3. The variable `post[v]` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `graph[v]` contains at least one element.
- `v` is a valid vertex in the graph.
- `w` is a vertex such that the depth of `w` is not -1.
- Either the depth of `w` is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1.
- If `used[w]` is `False`, no change is made to the values of `depth[v]` and `post[v]`.
- If `used[w]` is `True`, the value of `depth[v]` is set to `depth[w] + 1` under the specified conditions.

Since the code explicitly sets `depth[v]` to `depth[w] + 1` only when the conditions are met and `used[w]` is `True`, we assume those conditions are met (as per the problem statement). Therefore, `depth[v]` will be updated to `depth[w] + 1`.

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `w` is a vertex such that the depth of `w` is not -1 and either the depth of `w` is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1, `used[w]` is `True`, `depth[v]` is now `depth[w] + 1`, `post[v]` remains unchanged.**
