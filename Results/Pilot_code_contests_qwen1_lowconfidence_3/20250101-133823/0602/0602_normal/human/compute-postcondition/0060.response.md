The code `post[v] = w` assigns the value of `w` to `post[v]`. Given the initial conditions:

- `graph[v]` contains at least one element,
- `v` is a valid vertex in the graph,
- `q` contains at least one vertex,
- `w` is the first element of `graph[v]`,
- `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`,
- `depth[w]` is not -1 and either `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is -1.

The only variable that changes its value is `post[v]`, which is now set to `w`.

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `q` contains at least one vertex, `w` is the first element of `graph[v]`, `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`, `depth[w]` is not -1 and either `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is -1, `post[v]` is `w`.**
