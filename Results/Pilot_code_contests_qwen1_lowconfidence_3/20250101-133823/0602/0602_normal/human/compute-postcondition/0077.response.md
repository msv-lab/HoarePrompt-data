The code `used[w] = True` updates the value of `used[w]` to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least two elements, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `q` now contains at least one vertex plus `w`, `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1`, `post[v]` is now equal to `w`, `used[w]` is `True`.**
