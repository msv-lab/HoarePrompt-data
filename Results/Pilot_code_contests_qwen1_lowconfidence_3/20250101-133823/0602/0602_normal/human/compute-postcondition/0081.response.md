Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex in the graph, `depth[v]` is the shortest path distance from `v` to the farthest vertex in the graph, `post[v]` is the last vertex processed in the DFS traversal rooted at `v`, `q` is a queue containing all vertices reachable from `v` through unvisited edges, `used` indicates which vertices have been visited, and `depth[w]` and `post[w]` are updated accordingly for all `w` in `graph[v]`. If the loop does not execute, `depth[v]` remains -1, `post[v]` remains its original value, and `q` remains its initial state.**
