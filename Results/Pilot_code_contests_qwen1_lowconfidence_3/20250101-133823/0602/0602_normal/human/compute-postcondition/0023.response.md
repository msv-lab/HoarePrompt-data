Postcondition: ***`args` is a non-empty list, the file contains the concatenation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, `at_start` is `False`, and `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, the file buffer is flushed. Otherwise, the file buffer remains unchanged.***
