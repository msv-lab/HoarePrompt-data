`func_3(i + 1)` is called with the argument `i + 1`. However, the function `func_3` itself is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we cannot determine what exact changes this function makes to the variables. The only change we can infer is that `i + 1` is passed as an argument to `func_3`.

Given the preconditions:
- `n` is `n_input`
- `m` is `m_input`
- `graph` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of nodes connected to the node represented by the index
- `post` is the result of `func_1(graph)` sliced from index 1 onwards and must contain at least one element
- `i + 2` is a valid index in `post`
- -1 is not in `post`

The output state remains the same as the initial state because no further information about `func_3` or its effects is provided.

Output State: **`n` is `n_input`, `m` is `m_input`, `graph` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of nodes connected to the node represented by the index, `post` is the result of `func_1(graph)` sliced from index 1 onwards and must contain at least one element, `i + 2` is a valid index in `post`, and -1 is not in `post`**
