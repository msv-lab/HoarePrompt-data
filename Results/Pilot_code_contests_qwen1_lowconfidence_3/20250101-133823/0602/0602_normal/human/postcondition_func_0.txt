The function `func_1` accepts a graph represented as a list of lists and a starting node, and performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal starting from the given node. It updates the `depth` and `post` arrays to keep track of the shortest path distances and the last vertex processed in the DFS traversal, respectively. After the traversal, it returns the last vertex processed in the DFS traversal rooted at the starting node (`post[v]`). Potential edge cases include the graph being empty or the starting node not being connected to any other nodes. In such cases, `depth[v]` would remain -1 and `post[v]` would retain its initial value of -1. The function also ensures that all reachable vertices from the starting node are visited and their corresponding `depth` and `post` values are updated.
