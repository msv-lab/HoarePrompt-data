The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of books and a series of pairs `(t, w)` where `t` is the type of book (either 1 or 2) and `w` is the weight of the book (an integer between 1 and 100). It constructs a list of books, sorts and reverses this list based on weight, and calculates the sum of the types of the books until the remaining weight (`W`) is no longer sufficient to continue adding types. The function then prints the sum of the types of the books that can be added without violating the condition `W <= T`.
