Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100; `myBooks` is a non-empty reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements without the first book; `W` is the original value of `W` minus the weight of the first book in the new `myBooks`; `T` is the original value of `T` plus twice the type of the first book in the new `myBooks`; `book` is the first element in the new `myBooks`. If `W` is less than or equal to `T`, the postcondition remains as described. If `W` is greater than `T`, the postcondition does not change since there is no else part specified.***
