According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be greater than 0. Since the loop is defined as `range(0, n)`, the loop will execute for `n` times. After each iteration, `i` will increment by 1.

To determine the new state, we need to consider:
1. The initial condition for the loop: `n` must be greater than 0.
2. The loop will run until `i < n`. After each iteration, `i` increases by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, since `n` must be greater than 0, it means the loop has run at least once. To execute the loop one more time, `n` must remain greater than 0, and `i` will be incremented by 1.

So, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was previously 0 (since it starts from 0), it will now be 1.
- `w` and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer from user input, `w` is twice its original value, `myBooks` includes a new element \([w, t]\), `i` is 1**
