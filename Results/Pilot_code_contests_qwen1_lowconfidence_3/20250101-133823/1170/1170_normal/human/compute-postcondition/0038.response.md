Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of books and a series of pairs `(t, w)` where `t` is the type of book (either 1 or 2) and `w` is the weight of the book (an integer between 1 and 100). It constructs a list of books, sorts and reverses this list based on weight, and calculates the sum of the types of the books until the remaining weight (`W`) is no longer sufficient to continue adding types. The function then prints the sum of the types of the books that can be added without violating the condition `W <= T`.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `n` is 0, the function will read no inputs, but since `n` is checked to be within the range 1 to 100, this case is handled.
- If all books have a total weight greater than the sum of their types (`W > T`), the loop will not execute, and the function will print 0 because `T` remains its initial value of 0.
- The function does not handle invalid inputs for `t` (it only checks for `w`), so if `t` is neither 1 nor 2, the behavior is undefined. However, the annotations do not specify this as a check, so this is an edge case to be aware of.
- The function does not return any value; it only prints the result, which is the sum of the types of the books that can be added under the given conditions.
