The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but rather exits the loop or block it is inside. Given that the `break` statement is not inside a loop or conditional block in the provided code, it simply ends the current context and does not affect any variable values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100; `myBooks` is a non-empty reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements without the first book; `W` is the original value of `W` minus the weight of the first book in the new `myBooks`; `T` is the original value of `T` plus twice the type of the first book in the new `myBooks`; `book` is the first element in the new `myBooks`.**
