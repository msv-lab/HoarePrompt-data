`t` and `w` are assigned the values obtained from `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This means that `raw_input()` reads a line of input from the user, and `split()` splits this line into two parts (assuming there's only one space as a delimiter), which are then converted to integers by `map(int, ...)`. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer from user input, `w` is an integer from user input**
