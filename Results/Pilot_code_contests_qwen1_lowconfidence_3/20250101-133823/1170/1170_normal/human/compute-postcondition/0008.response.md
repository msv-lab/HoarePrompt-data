The code `t, w = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `t` and `w` respectively. Since `w` was originally twice its original value, the value of `w` before this operation is `2 * (original w)`. After the operation, `w` gets updated to the new value read from the input.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `t` is an integer from user input
- `w` is twice its original value
- `myBooks` includes a new element `[w, t]`
- `i` is 1

After the code executes:
- `t` is updated to the second integer input by the user
- `w` is updated to the first integer input by the user (since it is twice its original value, which is now the same as the value of `t`)

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer from user input, `w` is equal to `t`, `myBooks` includes a new element `[w, t]`, `i` is 1**
