The code initializes the variable `W` to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `myBooks`, `ti`, or `wi`. The value of `W` is set to 0, which is a specific value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user within the range 1 to 100, `myBooks` is an empty list, for each book `i` (1 <= `i` <= `n`), `ti` is 1 or 2, `wi` is an integer such that 1 <= `wi` <= 100, and `W` is 0.**
