`T` is incremented by `book[1]`, where `book` is the first element in the list `myBooks`. Since `myBooks` is a non-empty reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements, `book[1]` is the type of the first book in the list. The value of `T` is updated, but the exact value depends on the type of the first book. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `myBooks` is a non-empty reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements, `W` is the sum of all weights entered by the user, `T` is the original value of `T` plus the type of the first book in `myBooks`, `book` is the first element in `myBooks`**
