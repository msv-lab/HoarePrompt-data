`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`. The input from the user will be converted to an integer, which is within the range 1 <= n <= 100 as per the initial state. The values of `ti` and `wi` for each book are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, for each book i (1 <= i <= n), `ti` is an integer such that `ti` = 1 or `ti` = 2, and `wi` is an integer such that 1 <= `wi` <= 100. `n` is now set to the integer input from the user within the specified range.**
