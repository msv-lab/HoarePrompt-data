The code `t, w = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes two space-separated integers from user input and converts them to integers, assigning the first integer to `t` and the second integer to `w`. Since `raw_input()` is not a standard Python function in Python 3, we assume this is meant to be `input()` in Python 3. Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `t` is an integer from user input.
- `w` is equal to `2 * t`.
- `myBooks` includes a new element `[2 * t, t]`.
- `i` is 2.

After executing the code, `t` and `w` will be updated with the values from user input. Since the values of `n`, `myBooks`, and `i` are not affected by the code, they remain unchanged.

Let's denote the values from user input as `user_t` and `user_w`. Therefore, `t` will be assigned `user_t` and `w` will be assigned `user_w`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `t` is `user_t`, `w` is `user_w`, `myBooks` includes a new element `[2 * user_t, user_t]`, `i` is 2**
