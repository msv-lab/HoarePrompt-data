The code snippet `T += book[1]` increments the value of `T` by the value of `book[1]`. Since `book` is the second element in the new `myBooks`, `book[1]` is the type of the second book in the updated `myBooks`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100.
- `myBooks` is a non-empty reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements, excluding the first book from the current list.
- `W` is the original value of `W` minus the weight of the first book in the new `myBooks`.
- `T` is the original value of `T` plus twice the type of the first book in the new `myBooks`.
- `book` is the second element in the new `myBooks`.

After executing `T += book[1]`, `T` is updated by adding `book[1]` (the type of the second book in the new `myBooks`) to its original value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100; `myBooks` is a non-empty reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements, excluding the first book from the current list; `W` is the original value of `W` minus the weight of the first book in the new `myBooks`; `T` is the original value of `T` plus twice the type of the first book in the new `myBooks` plus `book[1]`; `book` is the second element in the new `myBooks`.**
