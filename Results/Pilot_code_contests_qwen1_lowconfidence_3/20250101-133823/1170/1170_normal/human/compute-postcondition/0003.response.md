Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer input from the user within the range 1 to 100.
- `myBooks` is an empty list.
- For each book `i` (1 <= `i` <= `n`), `ti` is 1 or 2.
- `wi` is an integer such that 1 <= `wi` <= 100.
- `W` is 0.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`:**
   - The loop `for i in range(0, n):` will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0.

2. **Variable `myBooks`:**
   - This variable is a list and is initially empty.
   - The loop body will add books to this list, but the initial state of `myBooks` being empty does not affect whether the loop can start.

3. **Variables `ti` and `wi`:**
   - These variables represent attributes of each book and are defined for each book `i` where `1 <= i <= n`.
   - Since the loop will iterate over all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, these values will be set within the loop itself and do not affect the initial condition for the loop to execute.

4. **Variable `W`:**
   - `W` is initialized to 0.
   - This value is not directly related to the loop condition and is set inside the loop body.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `n` is greater than 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
