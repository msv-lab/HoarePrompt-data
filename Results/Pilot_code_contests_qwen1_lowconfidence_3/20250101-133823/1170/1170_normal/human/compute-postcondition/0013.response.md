The code `W += w` increments the value of `W` by the value of `w`. Since `W` was initially equal to `user_w`, after executing this line, `W` will be `user_w + user_w`, which simplifies to `2 * user_w`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `t` is `user_t`, `w` is `user_w`, `myBooks` includes a new element `[2 * user_t, user_t]`, `i` is 2, `W` is `2 * user_w`**
