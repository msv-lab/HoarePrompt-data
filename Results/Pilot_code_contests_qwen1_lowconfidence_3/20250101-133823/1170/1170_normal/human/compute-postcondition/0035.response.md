Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements, `W` is the sum of all weights minus the sum of the weights of all books in `myBooks`, `T` is the sum of all types of all books in `myBooks`, `book` is the last element in `myBooks` (if the loop executes at least once). If the loop does not execute, `W` remains the original value of `W`, `T` remains the original value of `T`, and `myBooks` remains the original list. If the loop executes at least once and `W` is less than or equal to `T`, we break out of the loop.**
