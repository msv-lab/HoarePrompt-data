`W` is decreased by `book[0]`, which is the weight of the first book in `myBooks`. Since `book` is the first element in `myBooks`, and `myBooks` is a non-empty reversed sorted list, `book` is a list containing the weight and type of the first book. Therefore, `W` is reduced by the weight of the first book. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `myBooks` is a non-empty reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements, `W` is the sum of all weights minus the weight of the first book in `myBooks`, `T` is the original value of `T` plus the type of the first book in `myBooks`, `book` is the first element in `myBooks`**
