Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**: 
   - `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100.
   - `myBooks` is a non-empty reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements, but it excludes the first book from the previous iteration.
   - `W` is the original value of `W` minus the weight of the first book in the new `myBooks`.
   - `T` is the original value of `T` plus twice the type of the first book in the new `myBooks`.
   - `book` is the first element in the new `myBooks`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each `book` in `myBooks`.
   - At the end of the last iteration, `book` is the first element of the current `myBooks`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements in `myBooks`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `myBooks` must contain at least one element.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list and we just processed the first book (i.e., `myBooks` was not empty before the last iteration), it now contains at least one book.
   - For the next iteration, `book` will be the next element in the list, and `myBooks` will exclude this next element.
   - The values of `W` and `T` remain the same as they were after the last iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
- `myBooks` is a non-empty reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements, excluding the first book from the current list.
- `book` is the second element in the new `myBooks`.

Given these conditions, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100; `myBooks` is a non-empty reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements, excluding the first book from the current list; `W` is the original value of `W` minus the weight of the first book in the new `myBooks`; `T` is the original value of `T` plus twice the type of the first book in the new `myBooks`; `book` is the second element in the new `myBooks`.**
