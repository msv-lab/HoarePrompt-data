Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `myBooks` is a non-empty reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements, `W` is the sum of all weights minus the weight of the first book in `myBooks`, `T` is the original value of `T` plus the type of the first book in `myBooks`, `book` is the first element in `myBooks`. If `W` is less than or equal to `T`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
