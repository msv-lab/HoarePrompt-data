The code `break` does not affect the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Given the initial state and since there is no loop or conditional statement that would be directly exited by this `break`, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `myBooks` is a non-empty reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements, `W` is the sum of all weights minus the weight of the first book in `myBooks`, `T` is the original value of `T` plus the type of the first book in `myBooks`, `book` is the first element in `myBooks`, and `W` is less than or equal to `T`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
