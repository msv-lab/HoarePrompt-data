The code appends the list `[w, t]` to the `myBooks` list. Given the initial state, `w` is equal to `2 * t`, and `t` is an integer from user input. Since `t` is an integer from user input, the value of `w` is `2 * t`. Therefore, the list `[w, t]` will be appended to `myBooks`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer from user input, `w` is equal to `2 * t`, `myBooks` includes a new element `[2 * t, t]`, `i` is 1**
