The code `myBooks.append([w, t])` appends a new list `[w, t]` to the list `myBooks`. Given the initial state, the value of `w` is `user_w` and the value of `t` is `user_t`. After appending the new list, the list `myBooks` will include the new element `[user_w, user_t]`.

The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `W`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `t` is `user_t`, `w` is `user_w`, `myBooks` includes elements `[2 * user_t, user_t]` and `[user_w, user_t]`, `i` is 2, `W` is `2 * user_w`**
