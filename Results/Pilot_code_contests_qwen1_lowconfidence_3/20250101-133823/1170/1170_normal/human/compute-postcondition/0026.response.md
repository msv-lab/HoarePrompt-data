The code `T += book[1]` increments the value of `T` by the type value of the first book in the list `myBooks`. Since `book` is the first element in `myBooks`, `book[1]` is the type of the first book in `myBooks`. The value of `T` was originally the sum of all weights minus the weight of the first book in the new `myBooks` and the original value of `T` plus the type of the first book in the new `myBooks`. After the operation, `T` is updated to include the type of the first book in `myBooks`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `myBooks` is a non-empty reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements without the first book, `W` is the sum of all weights minus the weight of the first book in the new `myBooks`, `T` is the original value of `T` plus twice the type of the first book in the new `myBooks`, `book` is the first element in the new `myBooks`.**
