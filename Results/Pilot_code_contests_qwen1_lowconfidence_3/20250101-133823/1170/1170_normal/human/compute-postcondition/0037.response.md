The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly listed in the given function signature. However, based on the problem description, it seems the function should process a set of books where each book has a type (`ti`) and a weight (`wi`). The constraints are that `n` (the number of books) is an integer between 1 and 100, `ti` is either 1 or 2, and `wi` is an integer between 1 and 100.

Given the output cases are not specified directly, we can infer the function might return some aggregated result based on the types and weights of the books. Since no specific output cases are provided, we'll describe the expected inputs and return type generally.

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of books `n` and for each book `i` (1 <= i <= n), it accepts `ti` (type of book, either 1 or 2) and `wi` (weight of book, 1 <= wi <= 100). The return value is not specified but could be an aggregated result based on the types and weights of the books.**
