`w` is incremented by `w`. Since `w` is already an integer from user input, adding `w` to itself results in doubling the value of `w`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer from user input, `w` is twice its original value**
