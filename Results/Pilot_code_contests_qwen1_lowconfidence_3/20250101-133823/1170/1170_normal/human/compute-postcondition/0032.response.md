`W` is decreased by the weight of the first book in the new `myBooks`. The first book in the new `myBooks` is accessed using `book`, which is the second element in the new `myBooks`. Since `book` is the second element in the new `myBooks`, the value of `W` is updated to `W - book[0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100; `myBooks` is a non-empty reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements, excluding the first book from the current list; `W` is the original value of `W` minus the weight of the first book in the new `myBooks`; `T` is the original value of `T` plus twice the type of the first book in the new `myBooks` plus `book[1]`; `book` is the second element in the new `myBooks`; `W` is updated to `W - book[0]`.**
