The code `myBooks.reverse()` reverses the list `myBooks`. Since `myBooks` was initially a sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements, reversing it will simply change the order of its elements. The values of `n` and `W` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements, `W` is the sum of all weights entered by the user.**
