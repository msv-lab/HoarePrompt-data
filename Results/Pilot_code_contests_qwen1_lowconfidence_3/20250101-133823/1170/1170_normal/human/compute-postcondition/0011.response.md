According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the following conditions were true:
- `n` must be greater than 0,
- `t` is an integer from user input,
- `w` is equal to `2 * t`,
- `myBooks` includes a new element `[2 * t, t]`,
- `i` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2 (since `i` starts at 1), and `n` must still be greater than 1 (since `i` must be less than `n`).

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `n` must be greater than 1,
- `t` remains an integer from user input,
- `w` remains equal to `2 * t`,
- `myBooks` includes a new element `[2 * t, t]`,
- `i` is 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `t` is an integer from user input, `w` is equal to `2 * t`, `myBooks` includes a new element `[2 * t, t]`, `i` is 2**
