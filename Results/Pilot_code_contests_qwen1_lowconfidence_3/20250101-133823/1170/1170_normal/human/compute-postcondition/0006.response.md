`myBooks` is a list that gets a new element appended to it. The new element is a list containing `[w, t]`. Given that `w` is twice its original value, and `t` is an integer from user input, the updated state is as follows:

- `n` must be greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `t` is an integer from user input (unchanged)
- `w` is twice its original value
- `myBooks` now includes a new element `[w, t]`

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `t` is an integer from user input; `w` is twice its original value; `myBooks` includes a new element `[w, t]`**
