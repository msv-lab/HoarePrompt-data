According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `myBooks`. The loop will execute if `myBooks` is a non-empty list. Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`myBooks`**: This list must be non-empty for the loop to execute.
2. **`book`**: At the start of the loop, `book` should be set to the first element in the list `myBooks`.

Given the initial state where `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements, `W` is the sum of all weights entered by the user, and `T` is 0, we need to ensure that `myBooks` is non-empty.

State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `myBooks` is a non-empty reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements, `W` is the sum of all weights entered by the user, `T` is 0, `book` is the first element in `myBooks`**
