Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `myBooks` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is a list `[weight, type]` where `weight` is the sum of weights entered by the user and `type` is the type of book entered by the user, `W` is the sum of all weights entered by the user.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the number of books the user inputs.
- For each iteration, the user provides `t` (type of book) and `w` (weight of the book).
- The weight `w` is added to `W`.
- The pair `[w, t]` is appended to the list `myBooks`.
- After the loop completes, `myBooks` will contain `n` elements, each representing a book with its weight and type.
- `W` will be the sum of all weights entered by the user.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0):
- `myBooks` remains an empty list.
- `W` remains 0.
