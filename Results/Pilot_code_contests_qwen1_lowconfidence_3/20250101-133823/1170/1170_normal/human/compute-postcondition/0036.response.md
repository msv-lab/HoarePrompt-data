The code `print(T)` simply prints the value of `T`. It does not change the value of `T` or any other variables. Therefore, the only change is that the value of `T` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements, `W` is the sum of all weights minus the sum of the weights of all books in `myBooks`, `T` is the sum of all types of all books in `myBooks`, `book` is the last element in `myBooks` (if the loop executes at least once), `T` is printed.**
