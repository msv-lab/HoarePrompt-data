`W` is decreased by the weight of the first book in the new `myBooks`. The value of `W` was originally the sum of all weights minus the weight of the first book in the original `myBooks`. After subtracting the weight of the first book in the new `myBooks`, the new value of `W` becomes the original `W` minus twice the weight of the first book in the new `myBooks`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100.
- `myBooks` is a non-empty reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements without the first book.
- `T` is the original value of `T` plus twice the type of the first book in the new `myBooks`.
- `book` is the first element in the new `myBooks`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100; `myBooks` is a non-empty reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements without the first book; `W` is the original value of `W` minus the weight of the first book in the new `myBooks`; `T` is the original value of `T` plus twice the type of the first book in the new `myBooks`; `book` is the first element in the new `myBooks`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100; `myBooks` is a non-empty reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements without the first book; `W` is the original value of `W` minus the weight of the first book in the new `myBooks`; `T` is the original value of `T` plus twice the type of the first book in the new `myBooks`; `book` is the first element in the new `myBooks`.**
