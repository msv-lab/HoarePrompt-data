The value of `w` is incremented by `w`, which means `w` is doubled. The initial value of `w` is `t`, so `w` is now `2 * t`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer from user input, `w` is equal to `2 * t`, `myBooks` includes a new element `[w, t]`, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer from user input, `w` is equal to `2 * t`, `myBooks` includes a new element `[w, t]`, `i` is 1**
