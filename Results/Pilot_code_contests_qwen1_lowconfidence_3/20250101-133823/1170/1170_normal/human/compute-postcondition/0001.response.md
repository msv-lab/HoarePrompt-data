`n` is set to an integer input from the user within the range 1 to 100. The variable `myBooks` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `ti` and `wi` for each book are not affected by this code, and the value of `n` is now determined by user input. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` and the initialization of `myBooks`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user within the range 1 to 100, `myBooks` is an empty list, and for each book `i` (1 <= `i` <= `n`), `ti` is 1 or 2 and `wi` is an integer such that 1 <= `wi` <= 100.**
