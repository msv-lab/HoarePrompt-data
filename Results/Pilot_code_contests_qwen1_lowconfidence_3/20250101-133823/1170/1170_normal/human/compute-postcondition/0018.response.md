The code sets the variable `T` to 0. This initializes `T` without affecting the values of `n`, `myBooks`, or `W`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `T` and retains the initial values of `n`, `myBooks`, and `W`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements, `W` is the sum of all weights entered by the user, `T` is 0**
