Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the sum of the widths of the horizontal books is no more than the total thickness of the vertical books. Instead, it simply stops adding books once the remaining width (`W`) is less than the current total thickness (`T`), which may not satisfy the condition required by the problem description.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
1 10
2 5
2 5
2 5
```

The program will sort the books in descending order of width and start adding books to the vertical stack. However, it does not check if the sum of the widths of the horizontal books is within the limit of the total thickness of the vertical books. In this case, the program will add all books to the vertical stack because the width of the books is large enough to keep adding them without checking the condition. This violates the requirement that the sum of the widths of the horizontal books must be no more than the total thickness of the vertical books.

A correct implementation would need to ensure that the condition `W <= T` is checked properly, and if not, it should adjust the placement of books accordingly.
