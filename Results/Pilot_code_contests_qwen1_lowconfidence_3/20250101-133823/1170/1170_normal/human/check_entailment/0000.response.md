Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program attempts to minimize the total thickness of the vertical books by sorting the books in descending order of width and then greedily selecting books for the vertical stack until the sum of the widths of the horizontal books exceeds the total thickness of the vertical books. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum total thickness.

Consider the following input:
```
3
1 10
2 4
2 4
```

The correct output should be `3` because we can arrange the books as follows:
- Vertical: 2 (thickness 1), 2 (thickness 2)
- Horizontal: 1 (thickness 1), 2 (thickness 2)

The total thickness of the vertical books is 1 + 2 = 3, which is the minimum possible.

However, the provided program will incorrectly calculate the result as follows:
- Sort the books: [(10, 1), (4, 2), (4, 2)]
- Select books greedily:
  - Add (10, 1): W = 10, T = 1
  - Add (4, 2): W = 6, T = 3
  - Add (4, 2): W = 2, T = 5

The program outputs `5`, which is incorrect. Thus, the program does not handle this case correctly.
