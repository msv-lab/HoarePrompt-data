You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Shaass has n books. He wants to make a bookshelf for all his books. He wants the bookshelf's dimensions to be as small as possible. The thickness of the i-th book is ti and its pages' width is equal to wi. The thickness of each book is either 1 or 2. All books have the same page heights.

<image>

Shaass puts the books on the bookshelf in the following way. First he selects some of the books and put them vertically. Then he puts the rest of the books horizontally above the vertical books. The sum of the widths of the horizontal books must be no more than the total thickness of the vertical books. A sample arrangement of the books is depicted in the figure.

<image>

Help Shaass to find the minimum total thickness of the vertical books that we can achieve.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n, (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each of the next n lines contains two integers ti and wi denoting the thickness and width of the i-th book correspondingly, (1 ≤ ti ≤ 2, 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100).

Output

On the only line of the output print the minimum total thickness of the vertical books that we can achieve.

Program:

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    myBooks = []
    W = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        (t, w) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        W += w
        myBooks.append([w, t])
    myBooks.sort()
    myBooks.reverse()
    T = 0
    for book in myBooks:
        T += book[1]
        W -= book[0]
        if W <= T:
            break
    print(T)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program attempts to minimize the total thickness of the vertical books by sorting the books in descending order of width and then greedily selecting books for the vertical stack until the sum of the widths of the horizontal books exceeds the total thickness of the vertical books. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum total thickness.

Consider the following input:
```
3
1 10
2 4
2 4
```

The correct output should be `3` because we can arrange the books as follows:
- Vertical: 2 (thickness 1), 2 (thickness 2)
- Horizontal: 1 (thickness 1), 2 (thickness 2)

The total thickness of the vertical books is 1 + 2 = 3, which is the minimum possible.

However, the provided program will incorrectly calculate the result as follows:
- Sort the books: [(10, 1), (4, 2), (4, 2)]
- Select books greedily:
  - Add (10, 1): W = 10, T = 1
  - Add (4, 2): W = 6, T = 3
  - Add (4, 2): W = 2, T = 5

The program outputs `5`, which is incorrect. Thus, the program does not handle this case correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. For each book i (1 <= i <= n), ti is an integer such that ti = 1 or ti = 2, and wi is an integer such that 1 <= wi <= 100.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    myBooks = []
    W = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        t, w = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        W += w
        
        myBooks.append([w, t])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `myBooks` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is a list `[weight, type]` where `weight` is the sum of weights entered by the user and `type` is the type of book entered by the user, `W` is the sum of all weights entered by the user.
    myBooks.sort()
    myBooks.reverse()
    T = 0
    for book in myBooks:
        T += book[1]
        
        W -= book[0]
        
        if W <= T:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list of `[weight, type]` elements, `W` is the sum of all weights minus the sum of the weights of all books in `myBooks`, `T` is the sum of all types of all books in `myBooks`, `book` is the last element in `myBooks` (if the loop executes at least once). If the loop does not execute, `W` remains the original value of `W`, `T` remains the original value of `T`, and `myBooks` remains the original list. If the loop executes at least once and `W` is less than or equal to `T`, we break out of the loop.
    print(T)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
