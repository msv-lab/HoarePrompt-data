Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The core issue lies in the logic used to determine the minimum total thickness of the vertical books. Let's analyze why:

1. **Sorting and Reversing Books**: 
   - The program sorts and reverses the books based on their width (`myBooks.sort()` followed by `myBooks.reverse()`). This step is irrelevant because the goal is to minimize the total thickness of the vertical books, not to arrange them by width.

2. **Logic for Calculating Minimum Thickness**:
   - The program attempts to find the minimum thickness by iterating over the sorted list of books and accumulating the thickness until the sum of widths of the remaining horizontal books is less than or equal to the accumulated thickness (`if W <= T:`).
   - However, this logic does not correctly address the requirement. The correct approach should involve dynamic programming or a more strategic way to choose which books go vertically and which go horizontally.

3. **Incorrect Assumptions**:
   - The program does not ensure that the books are placed optimally to minimize the total thickness. It simply iterates through the books in reverse order and accumulates the thickness without considering the constraints properly.

A correct solution would involve dynamic programming to explore different ways of placing books vertically and horizontally while ensuring the constraints are met. Here is a conceptual outline of how the correct solution might look:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    books = []
    for _ in range(n):
        t, w = map(int, input().split())
        books.append((t, w))
    
    # Dynamic programming table
    dp = [float('inf')] * (sum(w for _, w in books) + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    
    for t, w in books:
        for j in range(len(dp) - w - 1, -1, -1):
            dp[j + w] = min(dp[j + w], dp[j] + t)
    
    min_thickness = float('inf')
    for i in range(sum(w for _, w in books) + 1):
        if dp[i] != float('inf'):
            min_thickness = min(min_thickness, dp[i] + (sum(w for _, w in books) - i))
    
    print(min_thickness)
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to find the minimum thickness needed for the vertical books, ensuring that the sum of the widths of the horizontal books does not exceed the total thickness of the vertical books. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.
