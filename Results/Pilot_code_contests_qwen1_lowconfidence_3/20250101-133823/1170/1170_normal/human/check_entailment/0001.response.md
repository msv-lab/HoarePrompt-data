Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to consider the constraint that the sum of the widths of the horizontal books must be no more than the total thickness of the vertical books. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
1 10
2 1
2 4
```

According to the problem description, the optimal solution would be to place the books with thickness 2 and width 4 and thickness 2 and width 1 vertically, resulting in a total thickness of 4. The remaining book with thickness 1 and width 10 would be placed horizontally, satisfying the condition that the sum of the widths of the horizontal books (10) is greater than the total thickness of the vertical books (4). However, the program incorrectly outputs 3 instead of 4.

This demonstrates that the program does not always produce the correct result, hence the correctness is **False**.
