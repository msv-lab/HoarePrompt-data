`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. The initial state includes that the file now contains `str(x)` followed by `sep`. After executing this line of code, the file will have `str(x)` followed by `sep` again because `str(x)` is written to the file once more.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least two elements, `at_start` is `False`, `sep` is written to the file, the file now contains `str(x) + sep`.**
