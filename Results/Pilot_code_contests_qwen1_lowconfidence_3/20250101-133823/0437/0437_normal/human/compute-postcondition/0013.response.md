The code sets `at_start` to `False`. This changes the value of `at_start` from its previous value (which was `False`). The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one element, and `at_start` is `False`; `sep` is written to the file; the file now contains `str(x)`.**
