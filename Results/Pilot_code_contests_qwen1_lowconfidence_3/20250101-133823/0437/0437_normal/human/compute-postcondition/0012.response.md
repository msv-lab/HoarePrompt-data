The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `args`, `at_start`, or `sep`. Therefore, the only change is in the content of the file.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one element, and `at_start` is `False`; `sep` is written to the file; the file now contains `str(x)`**
