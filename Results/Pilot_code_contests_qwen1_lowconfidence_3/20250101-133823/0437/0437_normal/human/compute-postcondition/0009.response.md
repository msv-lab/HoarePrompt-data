According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop will execute as long as `args` contains at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `args` must contain at least one element, and `at_start` is `False`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still contain at least one element. Since the loop has already processed at least one element from `args`, there must be fewer elements left in `args` after the last iteration.

Let's denote the number of elements left in `args` after the last iteration as \( n \). For the loop to execute one more time, \( n \) must be at least 1.

Given that `at_start` is `False`, it indicates that we are not at the beginning of the loop, meaning the loop has already executed at least once.

State: **`args` must contain at least one element, and `at_start` is `False`**.

Since the loop has already processed one element, and assuming the loop condition checks if there are elements left in `args`, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that there is at least one element remaining in `args`.

State: **`args` must contain at least one element, and `at_start` is `False`**.
