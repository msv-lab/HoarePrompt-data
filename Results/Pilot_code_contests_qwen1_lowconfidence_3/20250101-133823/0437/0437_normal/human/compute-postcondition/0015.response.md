The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. This changes the content of the file, but does not affect the values of `args`, `at_start`, or `sep`. The precondition that `args` must contain at least two elements and `at_start` being `True` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least two elements, `at_start` is `True`, `sep` is written to the file, the file now contains `str(x)` + `sep`**
