The code `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', b' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` affects the variables `sep` and `file` by assigning them the popped values from `kwargs`. If `kwargs` contains the key `'sep'`, `sep` is assigned its corresponding value; otherwise, `b' '` (a byte string containing a single space) is assigned to `sep`. Similarly, if `kwargs` contains the key `'file'`, `file` is assigned its corresponding value; otherwise, `sys.stdout` is assigned to `file`.

Since no specific values are provided for `kwargs` in the initial state, we assume the default behavior:

- If `kwargs` does not contain `'sep'`, `sep` is set to `b' '`.
- If `kwargs` does not contain `'file'`, `file` is set to `sys.stdout`.

Output State: **`sep` is `b' '` or the value associated with `'sep'` in `kwargs`, `file` is `sys.stdout` or the value associated with `'file'` in `kwargs`**
