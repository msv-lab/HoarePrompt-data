`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. The value of `sep` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains unchanged. The `args` variable and the `at_start` flag are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `args` must contain at least one element, and `at_start` is `False`; the value of `sep` is written to the file.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one element, and `at_start` is `False`; the value of `sep` is written to the file.**
