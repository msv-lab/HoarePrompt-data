Postcondition: **`args` must be an iterable containing at least one element, `at_start` remains `False`, `sep` is written to the file as many times as there are consecutive elements in `args` (excluding the first element), and the file now contains the concatenated string formed by converting each element of `args` to a string and separating them with `sep`; the file is also written with `b'\n'`. The call to `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` has been made, and the file is flushed since `flush` is `True`.**
