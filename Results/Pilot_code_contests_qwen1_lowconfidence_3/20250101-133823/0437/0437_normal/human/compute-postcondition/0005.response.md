The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file object `file`. However, the value of `sep` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. The only changes made by this line of code are related to the `file` object, which is not part of the initial state variables. The variables `args` and `at_start` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one element, `at_start` is False**
