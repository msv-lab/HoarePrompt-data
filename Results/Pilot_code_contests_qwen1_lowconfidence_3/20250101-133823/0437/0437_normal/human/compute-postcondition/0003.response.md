Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop is iterating over each element in the `args` list (or iterable) and performing some operations within the loop body.

2. **Dependencies for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, the primary requirement is that `args` should contain at least one element. If `args` is empty, the loop will not execute at all because there would be nothing to iterate over.

3. **Current States**:
   - `sep` is either `b' '` or the value associated with `'sep'` in `kwargs`.
   - `file` is either `sys.stdout` or the value associated with `'file'` in `kwargs`.
   - `at_start` is `True`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop requires `args` to have at least one element to execute, we need to ensure that `args` contains at least one element. This is the critical state change needed.
   - The values of `sep`, `file`, and `at_start` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute, but they might be used within the loop body. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for these specific states for loop execution purposes.

5. **Final State**:
   - We need to ensure `args` contains at least one element.

Therefore, the final state required for the loop to execute is:
**`args` must contain at least one element.**

So, the answer is:
State: **`args` must contain at least one element**
