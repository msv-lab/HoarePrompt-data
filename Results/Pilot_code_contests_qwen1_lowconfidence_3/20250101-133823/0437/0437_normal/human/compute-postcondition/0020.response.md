The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))` has the following impacts:
- It writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')` to the file.
- The `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')` function removes the `'end'` key from `kwargs` if it exists, and uses `b'\n'` as the default value if `'end'` is not present in `kwargs`.

Given the initial state:
- `args` must be an iterable containing at least one element.
- `at_start` is `False`.
- `sep` is written to the file as many times as there are consecutive elements in `args` (excluding the first element).
- The file now contains the concatenated string formed by converting each element of `args` to a string and separating them with `sep`.

Since the initial state does not specify the content of `kwargs`, we assume that `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'`. Therefore, `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')` will use the default value `b'\n'`.

Thus, the file is written with `b'\n'`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`args` must be an iterable containing at least one element, `at_start` is `False`, `sep` is written to the file as many times as there are consecutive elements in `args` (excluding the first element), and the file now contains the concatenated string formed by converting each element of `args` to a string and separating them with `sep`; the file is also written with `b'\n'`.**
