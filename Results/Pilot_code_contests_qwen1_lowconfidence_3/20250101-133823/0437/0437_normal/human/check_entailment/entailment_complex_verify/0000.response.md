Final: **False**

Reasoning: 

Based on the provided annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly compute the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after the operations. Specifically, the function `func_2` is never called with the correct argument value, and the result is always printed as 0, regardless of the input. This means the program cannot correctly compute the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after the operations.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
++-++
```
The expected output is 3, but the program will output 0. This is because the program does not properly calculate the initial number of stones needed to ensure the pile never becomes empty when a stone is taken. The function `func_2` is never called with the correct value of `cnt`, and hence the output is always 0.

Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is accurate.
