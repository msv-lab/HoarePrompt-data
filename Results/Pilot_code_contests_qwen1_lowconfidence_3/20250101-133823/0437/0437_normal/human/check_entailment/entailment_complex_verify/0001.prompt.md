You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has a pile, that consists of some number of stones. n times he either took one stone from the pile or added one stone to the pile. The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.

You are given n operations which Vasya has made. Find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.

Input

The first line contains one positive integer n — the number of operations, that have been made by Vasya (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The next line contains the string s, consisting of n symbols, equal to "-" (without quotes) or "+" (without quotes). If Vasya took the stone on i-th operation, s_i is equal to "-" (without quotes), if added, s_i is equal to "+" (without quotes).

Output

Print one integer — the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after these n operations.

Note

In the first test, if Vasya had 3 stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to 0. It is impossible to have less number of piles, so the answer is 0. Please notice, that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less, than 3, because in this case, Vasya won't be able to take a stone on some operation (the pile will be empty).

In the second test, if Vasya had 0 stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to 4. It is impossible to have less number of piles because after making 4 operations the number of stones in the pile increases on 4 stones. So, the answer is 4.

In the third test, if Vasya had 1 stone in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to 1. It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.

In the fourth test, if Vasya had 0 stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to 3.

```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the initial number of stones in the pile. According to the problem description, the initial number of stones must be sufficient to ensure that Vasya can perform each "take" operation without the pile becoming empty. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
---
```
The program calculates the minimum number of stones required by considering only the operations, but it does not account for the initial number of stones. In this case, if Vasya starts with 2 stones, the pile can become empty during the first "take" operation, which violates the condition that the pile must remain non-empty before each "take" operation.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the initial number of stones is at least equal to the number of "take" operations minus the number of "add" operations. This can be done by checking the count of "take" operations and ensuring that the initial number of stones is at least this count.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '-' and '+' characters from the user. It then iterates over each character in `s`, maintaining a running count `cnt` of the difference between the number of '+' characters and '-' characters. This count is adjusted by +1 for each '+' character and -1 for each '-' character, but it is reset to 0 whenever it becomes negative. After processing all characters in `s`, the function calls `func_2` with the final value of `cnt`. The final state of the program is that `n` and `s` retain their original values, and `cnt` contains the maximum prefix sum of `s` (the maximum value of the running count `cnt` during the iteration), ensuring that `cnt` never falls below 0. Potential edge cases include `n` being 1, where `cnt` would simply be +1 or -1 depending on the character in `s`. There is no explicit handling for invalid inputs like non-integer `n` or strings with lengths outside the specified range, so such cases should be considered outside the scope of this function.
