Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the provided annotated version of the code, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The function `func_1` calculates the net count of '+' and '-' characters in the input string `s` and sets `cnt` to 0 if it falls below 0. However, the function `func_2` is never called with the correct argument value. Instead, it is defined to accept parameters but is never actually called with any arguments. As a result, the program will always print 0, regardless of the input, which does not meet the problem description.

The problem requires finding the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the operations. Since `func_2` is never called with the correct argument (`cnt`), the program cannot achieve the intended functionality. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being False is accurate.
