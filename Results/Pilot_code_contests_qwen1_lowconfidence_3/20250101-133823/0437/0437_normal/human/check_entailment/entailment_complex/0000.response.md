Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code does not handle the case where the initial number of stones in the pile is not sufficient to perform all the operations as described.

### Analysis:

1. **Initial State Assumption**: The code assumes that the initial number of stones in the pile is at least as much as the net effect of the operations. However, the problem description states that "The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile." This implies that the pile should always have at least one stone before each `-` operation.

2. **Count Calculation**: The variable `cnt` keeps track of the net effect of the operations. For each `+` operation, `cnt` increases by 1, and for each `-` operation, `cnt` decreases by 1. If `cnt` ever goes below 0, it is reset to 0. However, this does not guarantee that the pile will always have enough stones to perform all `-` operations.

3. **Edge Case Example**:
   - Consider the input `n = 3` and `s = "---"`.
     - If the initial number of stones is 1, after the first `-` operation, the pile will have 0 stones, which violates the condition that the pile cannot be empty before a `-` operation.
     - The code will not detect this issue and will proceed without error, but the result will be incorrect because the pile will be empty before the second `-` operation.

4. **Correct Solution Approach**:
   - The correct approach is to ensure that the pile has at least `cnt + 1` stones initially. The pile should start with 1 stone plus the net effect of all `-` operations up to that point.

### Conclusion:
The code does not handle the scenario where the initial number of stones is insufficient to perform all `-` operations, which is a requirement according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is **Incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
