Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after the operations. Specifically, the function `func_2` is never called with the correct argument value, and the result is always printed as 0, regardless of the input. This means the program cannot correctly compute the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after the operations. For example, the input `5 ++-++` should output `3`, but the program outputs `0`. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being incorrect is valid.
