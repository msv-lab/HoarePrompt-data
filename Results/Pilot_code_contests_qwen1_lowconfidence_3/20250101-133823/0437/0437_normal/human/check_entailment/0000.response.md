Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the initial number of stones in the pile is greater than the maximum number of stones added minus the number of stones taken. Specifically, the function `func_2` is never called with the correct argument value, and the result is always printed as 0, regardless of the input. This means the program cannot correctly compute the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after the operations.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5
++-++
```
The expected output is 3, but the program will output 0. This is because the program does not properly calculate the initial number of stones needed to ensure the pile never becomes empty when a stone is taken.
