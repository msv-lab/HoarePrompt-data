Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program provided does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the following issues exist:

1. **Function `func_2` is unnecessary and unused**:
   - The function `func_2` is defined but never called. According to the problem description, the final result should be printed directly without calling another function.
   - The function `func_2` is defined to take `*args` and `**kwargs`, but it doesn't utilize these arguments, and it prints to a file, which is not required by the problem description.

2. **Incorrect handling of the output**:
   - The problem description states that the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the operations should be printed directly.
   - Instead of printing the value of `cnt`, the program calls `func_2(cnt)`, which is not necessary and does not achieve the intended output.

### Correct Implementation:

Here is a corrected version of the program that meets the problem description:

```python
def main():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    for op in s:
        if op == '+':
            cnt += 1
        else:
            cnt -= 1
        if cnt < 0:
            cnt = 0
    
    print(cnt)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Implementation:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of operations `n` and the string `s` as specified.
2. **Processing Operations**: It iterates through each character in `s` and updates the counter `cnt` accordingly.
   - If the character is `'+',` it increments the counter.
   - If the character is `'-'`, it decrements the counter.
   - If the counter goes below zero, it resets it to zero.
3. **Printing Output**: Finally, it prints the value of `cnt`, which represents the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the operations.

This implementation directly meets the problem description by calculating the minimal possible number of stones and printing it as required.
