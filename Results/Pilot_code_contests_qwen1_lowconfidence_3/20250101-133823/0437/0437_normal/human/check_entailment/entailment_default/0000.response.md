Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after the operations. The function `func_1` maintains a running count `cnt` of the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s`, but it resets `cnt` to 0 whenever it becomes negative. This approach is incorrect because it does not account for the minimal number of stones required after the operations.

For instance, consider the following cases:

1. **Input**: `n = 3`, `s = "---"`
   - According to the problem description, the minimal number of stones should be `0` (since we can start with 3 stones and remove all of them).
   - However, the current implementation will keep `cnt` as `0` throughout the loop and call `func_2(0)`, which does not give the correct minimal number of stones.

2. **Input**: `n = 3`, `s = "++-"`
   - According to the problem description, the minimal number of stones should be `1` (since we can start with 2 stones, add one more, and then remove one).
   - However, the current implementation will have `cnt` reach `2` and then drop to `1` and finally to `0`, and it will call `func_2(0)`, which again does not give the correct minimal number of stones.

The correct approach would be to keep track of the maximum value of `cnt` and ensure that the minimal number of stones is at least the absolute value of this maximum value. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    max_cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        cnt += 1 if s[i] == '+' else -1
        max_cnt = max(max_cnt, cnt)
    print(max_cnt)
```

This corrected function keeps track of both the current count `cnt` and the maximum count `max_cnt`, ensuring that the minimal number of stones is calculated correctly.
