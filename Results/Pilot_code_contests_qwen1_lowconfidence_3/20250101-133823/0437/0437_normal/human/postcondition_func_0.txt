The function `func_1` reads a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '-' and '+' characters from the user. It then iterates over each character in `s`, maintaining a running count `cnt` of the difference between the number of '+' characters and '-' characters. This count is adjusted by +1 for each '+' character and -1 for each '-' character, but it is reset to 0 whenever it becomes negative. After processing all characters in `s`, the function calls `func_2` with the final value of `cnt`. The final state of the program is that `n` and `s` retain their original values, and `cnt` contains the maximum prefix sum of `s` (the maximum value of the running count `cnt` during the iteration), ensuring that `cnt` never falls below 0. Potential edge cases include `n` being 1, where `cnt` would simply be +1 or -1 depending on the character in `s`. There is no explicit handling for invalid inputs like non-integer `n` or strings with lengths outside the specified range, so such cases should be considered outside the scope of this function.
