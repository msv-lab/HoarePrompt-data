Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Lexicographical Order**:
   - The program attempts to find the lexicographically smallest permutation of `s` that is strictly greater than `t`. However, the implementation does not correctly ensure that the resulting string is lexicographically minimal among all strings that are strictly greater than `t`.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The program incorrectly handles cases where no valid permutation exists. Specifically, if no valid permutation can be found, it returns `-1` without ensuring that the returned string is lexicographically minimal.
   - The program does not properly construct the smallest possible permutation that is strictly greater than `t`. It tries to incrementally build the string by finding the next available character in `s` that is lexicographically greater than the corresponding character in `t`, but this approach is flawed.

3. **Improper Use of Lists and Counters**:
   - The use of lists and counters (`scount` and `tcount`) to track character frequencies is generally sound, but the logic for constructing the final string is flawed. The program does not correctly ensure that the constructed string is both lexicographically greater than `t` and minimal among such strings.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled Correctly**:
   - The program fails to handle edge cases properly, such as when the string `s` is shorter than `t` or when the characters in `s` are insufficient to form a string that is strictly greater than `t`.

### Example of a Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
s = "abcd"
t = "abc"
```

The expected output should be "abce", but the program will not produce this output because it does not correctly handle the construction of the minimal string that is lexicographically greater than `t`.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to:
1. Identify the first position where `s` can be made greater than `t` while ensuring the resulting string is minimal.
2. Ensure the constructed string is lexicographically minimal among all valid permutations.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of how the solution could be implemented correctly:
1. Identify the first position in `s` where a character can be replaced to make the string greater than `t`.
2. Replace that character with the smallest possible character from `s` that makes the string greater than `t`.
3. Sort the remaining characters to ensure the result is lexicographically minimal.

Given these issues, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, hence the correctness is **False**.
