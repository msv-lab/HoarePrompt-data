Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not handle the case where the input string `s` is shorter than the reference string `t`. Specifically, the code attempts to construct a string that is lexicographically strictly more than `t` by permuting the characters in `s`, but it does not properly account for the length difference between `s` and `t`. 

For example, consider the input:
```
Input:
abc
abcd
```
The program should return `-1` because no permutation of `s` can be lexicographically larger than `t`. However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to an incorrect output. Therefore, the program needs to check the length of `s` and `t` and return `-1` if `s` is shorter than `t`.
