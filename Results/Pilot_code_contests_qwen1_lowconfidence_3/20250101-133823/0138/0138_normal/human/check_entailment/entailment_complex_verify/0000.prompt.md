You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Everything got unclear to us in a far away constellation Tau Ceti. Specifically, the Taucetians choose names to their children in a very peculiar manner.

Two young parents abac and bbad think what name to give to their first-born child. They decided that the name will be the permutation of letters of string s. To keep up with the neighbours, they decided to call the baby so that the name was lexicographically strictly larger than the neighbour's son's name t.

On the other hand, they suspect that a name tax will be introduced shortly. According to it, the Taucetians with lexicographically larger names will pay larger taxes. That's the reason abac and bbad want to call the newborn so that the name was lexicographically strictly larger than name t and lexicographically minimum at that.

The lexicographical order of strings is the order we are all used to, the "dictionary" order. Such comparison is used in all modern programming languages to compare strings. Formally, a string p of length n is lexicographically less than string q of length m, if one of the two statements is correct:

  * n < m, and p is the beginning (prefix) of string q (for example, "aba" is less than string "abaa"), 
  * p1 = q1, p2 = q2, ..., pk - 1 = qk - 1, pk < qk for some k (1 ≤ k ≤ min(n, m)), here characters in strings are numbered starting from 1. 



Write a program that, given string s and the heighbours' child's name t determines the string that is the result of permutation of letters in s. The string should be lexicographically strictly more than t and also, lexicographically minimum.

Input

The first line contains a non-empty string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000), where |s| is its length. The second line contains a non-empty string t (1 ≤ |t| ≤ 5000), where |t| is its length. Both strings consist of lowercase Latin letters.

Output

Print the sought name or -1 if it doesn't exist.

Examples

Input

aad
aac


Output

aad


Input

abad
bob


Output

daab


Input

abc
defg


Output

-1


Input

czaaab
abcdef


Output

abczaa

Note

In the first sample the given string s is the sought one, consequently, we do not need to change the letter order there.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input string `s` is shorter than the reference string `t`. In such cases, it should return `-1` because no permutation of `s` can be lexicographically larger than `t`.

Consider the following input:
```
Input:
abc
abcd
```
The program will attempt to find a valid permutation without considering the length constraint, leading to an incorrect output. The correct output for this case should be `-1`.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

    #The program returns an empty string since 'res' is the concatenation of all characters where 'scount[i]' was originally greater than 0, and 'scount[i]' for all i ranges from 0 to 25 is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no explicit parameters but reads two strings `s` and `t` from the user input, then processes these strings to determine the result based on specific conditions. After reading the strings, it counts the occurrences of each character in both strings `s` and `t` using `scount` and `tcount` respectively. It then compares these counts to check if every character in `s` appears at least as many times as in `t`.

If `scount` is always greater than or equal to `tcount` for all characters, and the lengths of `s` and `t` are equal, the function returns `-1`.

If the above condition is not met but the lengths of `s` and `t` are equal, it attempts to remove characters from `s` to match `t` by decrementing the corresponding counts in `scount`. If successful, it appends the remaining characters to `t` and returns the result as a string. If unsuccessful, it returns `-1`.

If the initial comparison indicates that `scount` is not always greater than or equal to `tcount`, the function proceeds to a more complex algorithm involving a temporary copy of `scount` (`scountcopy`) to find a valid starting index `works`. This index represents the position in `s` where the first character in `t` cannot be found in sufficient quantity in `s`. If such an index is found, it constructs a result string by taking characters from `t` up to this index and appending any remaining valid characters from `scountcopy` in lexicographical order. If no such index exists, it returns `-1`.

In all cases, the function returns `-1` in certain scenarios and constructs and returns a string in others, based on the comparison and processing of the input strings.
