Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input string `s` is shorter than the reference string `t`. In such cases, it should return `-1` because no permutation of `s` can be lexicographically larger than `t`.

Consider the following input:
```
Input:
abc
abcd
```
The program will attempt to find a valid permutation without considering the length constraint, leading to an incorrect output. The correct output for this case should be `-1`.
