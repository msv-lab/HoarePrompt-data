You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Everything got unclear to us in a far away constellation Tau Ceti. Specifically, the Taucetians choose names to their children in a very peculiar manner.

Two young parents abac and bbad think what name to give to their first-born child. They decided that the name will be the permutation of letters of string s. To keep up with the neighbours, they decided to call the baby so that the name was lexicographically strictly larger than the neighbour's son's name t.

On the other hand, they suspect that a name tax will be introduced shortly. According to it, the Taucetians with lexicographically larger names will pay larger taxes. That's the reason abac and bbad want to call the newborn so that the name was lexicographically strictly larger than name t and lexicographically minimum at that.

The lexicographical order of strings is the order we are all used to, the "dictionary" order. Such comparison is used in all modern programming languages to compare strings. Formally, a string p of length n is lexicographically less than string q of length m, if one of the two statements is correct:

  * n < m, and p is the beginning (prefix) of string q (for example, "aba" is less than string "abaa"), 
  * p1 = q1, p2 = q2, ..., pk - 1 = qk - 1, pk < qk for some k (1 ≤ k ≤ min(n, m)), here characters in strings are numbered starting from 1. 



Write a program that, given string s and the heighbours' child's name t determines the string that is the result of permutation of letters in s. The string should be lexicographically strictly more than t and also, lexicographically minimum.

Input

The first line contains a non-empty string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000), where |s| is its length. The second line contains a non-empty string t (1 ≤ |t| ≤ 5000), where |t| is its length. Both strings consist of lowercase Latin letters.

Output

Print the sought name or -1 if it doesn't exist.

Examples

Input

aad
aac


Output

aad


Input

abad
bob


Output

daab


Input

abc
defg


Output

-1


Input

czaaab
abcdef


Output

abczaa

Note

In the first sample the given string s is the sought one, consequently, we do not need to change the letter order there.
Program:
```
print(func_1())

def func_1():
    s = list(raw_input())
    t = list(raw_input())
    scount = [0] * 26
    tcount = [0] * 26
    for char in s:
        scount[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
    for char in t:
        tcount[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
    allgreater = True
    for i in range(26):
        if scount[i] < tcount[i]:
            allgreater = False
    if allgreater:
        if len(s) == len(t):
            return -1
        for char in t:
            scount[ord(char) - ord('a')] -= 1
        for i in range(26):
            while scount[i] > 0:
                t.append(chr(i + ord('a')))
                scount[i] -= 1
        return ''.join(map(str, t))
    works = -1
    scountcopy = list(scount)
    for i in range(len(s)):
        cando = False
        for j in range(ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
            if scountcopy[j] > 0:
                cando = True
        if cando:
            works = i
        if scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] == 0:
            break
        scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1
    if works == -1:
        return -1
    res = list()
    for i in range(works):
        res.append(t[i])
        scount[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1
    for j in range(ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
        if scount[j] > 0:
            res.append(chr(j + ord('a')))
            scount[j] -= 1
            break
    for i in range(26):
        while scount[i] > 0:
            res.append(chr(i + ord('a')))
            scount[i] -= 1
    return ''.join(map(str, res))


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes no explicit parameters but reads two strings `s` and `t` from the user input, then processes these strings to determine the result based on specific conditions. After reading the strings, it counts the occurrences of each character in both strings `s` and `t` using `scount` and `tcount` respectively. It then compares these counts to check if every character in `s` appears at least as many times as in `t`.

If `scount` is always greater than or equal to `tcount` for all characters, and the lengths of `s` and `t` are equal, the function returns `-1`.

If the above condition is not met but the lengths of `s` and `t` are equal, it attempts to remove characters from `s` to match `t` by decrementing the corresponding counts in `scount`. If successful, it appends the remaining characters to `t` and returns the result as a string. If unsuccessful, it returns `-1`.

If the initial comparison indicates that `scount` is not always greater than or equal to `tcount`, the function proceeds to a more complex algorithm involving a temporary copy of `scount` (`scountcopy`) to find a valid starting index `works`. This index represents the position in `s` where the first character in `t` cannot be found in sufficient quantity in `s`. If such an index is found, it constructs a result string by taking characters from `t` up to this index and appending any remaining valid characters from `scountcopy` in lexicographical order. If no such index exists, it returns `-1`.

In all cases, the function returns `-1` in certain scenarios and constructs and returns a string in others, based on the comparison and processing of the input strings.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
