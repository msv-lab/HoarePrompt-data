Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to find the lexicographically minimum permutation of `s` that is strictly greater than `t`. There are several issues:

1. **Handling of Cases Where `s` is Lexicographically Less Than `t`:**
   - The code checks if `scount` is always greater than or equal to `tcount` for all characters. If this is true and the lengths of `s` and `t` are equal, it returns `-1`. However, this condition does not ensure that `s` can be permuted to be strictly greater than `t`. For example, consider `s = 'aa'` and `t = 'bb'`. The code would incorrectly return `-1` even though a valid permutation `'ab'` exists.

2. **Constructing the Result String:**
   - The code attempts to construct the result string by appending characters from `t` up to the `works` index and then appending remaining valid characters from `scountcopy`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting string is lexicographically minimum among those that are strictly greater than `t`. For instance, consider `s = 'aab'` and `t = 'abb'`. The code would produce `'aab'`, but `'aba'` is a lexicographically smaller valid permutation.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle cases where no valid permutation exists that is strictly greater than `t`. For example, if `s = 'abc'` and `t = 'def'`, the code should return `-1`, but it does not correctly handle this scenario.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
