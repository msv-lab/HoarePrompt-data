To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the requirements for the loop to start.

### Given States:
- `scount` must have at least one element.
- `i` is the length of `s`.
- `tcount` is a list of integers.
- `allgreater` is either `True` or `False`.
- `cando` remains `True`.
- `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount` with the value at index `ord(t[i]) - ord('a')` decreased by 1 for each character `t[i]` in `s` for which `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] > 0`.
- `works` is an index for which the inner loop did not break.
- `res` is an empty list.

### Loop Condition:
The loop runs from `0` to `works - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - `i` should range from `0` to `works - 1`. For the loop to start, `works` must be greater than `0`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute for each value of `i` from `0` to `works - 1`.

3. **Dependencies:**
   - The loop's execution does not depend directly on `scount`, `tcount`, `allgreater`, `cando`, `scountcopy`, or `res`.
   - However, the value of `works` determines how many iterations the loop will perform.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, `works` must be greater than `0`. The other states (`scount`, `tcount`, `allgreater`, `cando`, `scountcopy`, and `res`) do not need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop's starting condition.

### Final Answer:
State: **`works` must be greater than 0**
