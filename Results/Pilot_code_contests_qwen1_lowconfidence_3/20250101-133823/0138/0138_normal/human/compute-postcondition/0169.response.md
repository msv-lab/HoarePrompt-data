Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing the first `works` characters from `t` plus an additional character `chr((ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 2) + ord('a'))`. If `scount[j]` is greater than 0, `res` is updated to include the character `chr(j + ord('a'))` and `scount[j]` is decreased by 1. `works` remains the same.***
