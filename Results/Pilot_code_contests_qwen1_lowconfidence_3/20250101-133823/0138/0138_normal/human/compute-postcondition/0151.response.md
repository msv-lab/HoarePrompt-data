`res` appends `t[i]` to itself. The value of `works` is greater than 1, `res` initially contained `t[i+1]` and `t[i+2]` appended to it, and `scount[ord(t[i+1]) - ord('a')]` was decreased by 1. After appending `t[i]` to `res`, the new value of `res` will be `t[i+1], t[i+2], t[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`works` is greater than 1, `res` is `t[i+1], t[i+2], t[i]`, `scount[ord(t[i+1]) - ord('a')]` is decreased by 1**
