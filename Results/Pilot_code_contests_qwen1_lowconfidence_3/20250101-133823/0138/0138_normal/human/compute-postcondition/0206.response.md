The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. 

- In Case_1, the function returns -1.
- In Case_2, the function returns a string obtained by joining the elements of list 't' converted to strings.
- In Case_3, the function returns -1.
- In Case_4, the function returns an empty string since 'res' is the concatenation of all characters where 'scount[i]' was originally greater than 0, and 'scount[i]' for all i ranges from 0 to 25 is 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to return -1 in two cases, return a string in one case, and return an empty string in another case.
