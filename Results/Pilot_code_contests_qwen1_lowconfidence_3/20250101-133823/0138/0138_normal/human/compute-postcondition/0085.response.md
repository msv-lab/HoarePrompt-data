Let's break down the given information and determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information at the End of the Previous Iteration:

- `scount` must have at least one element (i.e., `len(scount) > 0`)
- `i` is 0
- `tcount` is a list of integers
- `allgreater` is either `True` or `False`
- `works` is -1
- `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount`
- `cando` is `True`, because there exists some valid `j` such that `scountcopy[j] > 0`
- `t[0]` should be a valid character such that `ord(t[0]) - ord('a') + 1` is between 1 and 25
- `cando` is `True`

### For Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` starting from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` up to 25 (inclusive).

2. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - Therefore, `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` is `ord(t[0]) - ord('a') + 1`.

3. **Range of `j`**: The loop will start with `j = ord(t[0]) - ord('a') + 1` and continue until `j < 26`.

4. **Initial Value of `j`**: Since `i` is 0, we start with `j = ord(t[0]) - ord('a') + 1`.

5. **Loop Execution**: For each value of `j` within this range, the loop body will execute.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - After one iteration of the loop, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be less than 26.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `j < 26`.

7. **Determining the Next Value of `j`**:
   - If `j` is initially `ord(t[0]) - ord('a') + 1`, then after the first iteration, `j` becomes `ord(t[0]) - ord('a') + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 26.

8. **Adjusting Other Variables**:
   - `i` remains 0 as the loop only increments `j`.
   - `scount`, `tcount`, `allgreater`, `works`, `scountcopy`, and `cando` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but based on the given information, they are not modified by the loop.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 26. Therefore, the initial value of `j` after the first iteration is `ord(t[0]) - ord('a') + 2`.

**Final State**:
- `scount` must have at least one element (i.e., `len(scount) > 0`)
- `i` is 0
- `tcount` is a list of integers
- `allgreater` is either `True` or `False`
- `works` is -1
- `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount`
- `cando` is `True` (unchanged)
- `t[0]` should be a valid character such that `ord(t[0]) - ord('a') + 1` is between 1 and 25
- `j` is `ord(t[0]) - ord('a') + 2` (initial value for the next iteration)

**State:**
**`scount` must have at least one element (i.e., `len(scount) > 0`), `i` is 0, `tcount` is a list of integers, `allgreater` is either `True` or `False`, `works` is -1, `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount`, `cando` is `True`, `t[0]` should be a valid character such that `ord(t[0]) - ord('a') + 1` is between 1 and 25, `j` is `ord(t[0]) - ord('a') + 2`**
