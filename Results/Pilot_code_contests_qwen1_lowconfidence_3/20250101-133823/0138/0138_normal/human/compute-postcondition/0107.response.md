Postcondition: ***`scount` must have at least one element, `i` is 2, `j` is `ord(t[2]) - ord('a') + 2` and must be a valid index and less than 26, `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount` with the value at index `j` decreased by 1, `tcount` is a list of integers, `allgreater` is either `True` or `False`, `cando` is `True`, `works` is set to `-1, and `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0. Since the if part does not change the state when `scountcopy[j] > 0`, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
