Output State: **`t` is a list of characters, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers where each integer represents the count of a corresponding character from 'a' to 'z' in the list `t`, and if the loop executed at least once, `char` is the last character processed in the list `t`. If the loop did not execute, `tcount` remains a list of 26 zeros.**
