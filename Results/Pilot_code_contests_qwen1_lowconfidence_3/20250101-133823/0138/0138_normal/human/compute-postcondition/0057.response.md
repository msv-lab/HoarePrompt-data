`t` is a list that appends a new element to itself. The element being appended is `chr(i + ord('a'))`. Given `i` is 1, `ord('a')` is 97, so `i + ord('a')` is 98, and `chr(98)` is 'b'. The original list `t` was `['b']`, so appending 'b' to it results in `['b', 'b']`. The value of `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1; `scount[1]` must be greater than 0; `t` is `['b', 'b']`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `scount[1]` must be greater than 0; `t` is `['b', 'b']`**
