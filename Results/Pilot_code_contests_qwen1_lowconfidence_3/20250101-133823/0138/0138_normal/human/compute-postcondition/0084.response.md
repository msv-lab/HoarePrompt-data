Postcondition: ***`scount` must have at least one element (len(scount) > 0), `i` is 0, `tcount` is a list of integers, `allgreater` is either `True` or `False`, `works` is -1, `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount`, `cando` is `True`, `t[0]` should be a valid character such that `ord(t[0]) - ord('a') + 1` is between 1 and 25, and `cando` is `True` if `scountcopy[j] > 0` for some valid `j`, otherwise `cando` remains `False`.***
