`scount[i]` is decremented by 1. Given that `i` is 1, `scount[1]` is decremented by 1. Since `scount[1]` must be greater than 0 initially, after decrementing by 1, it will still be greater than 0 (it will now be `scount[1] - 1`). The value of `i` and the list `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `scount[1]` is `scount[1] - 1`; `t` is `['b', 'b', 'b']`**
