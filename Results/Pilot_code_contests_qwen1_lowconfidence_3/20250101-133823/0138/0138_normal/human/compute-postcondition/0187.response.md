The code `res.append(chr(i + ord('a')))` appends the character corresponding to `i + ord('a')` to the list `res`. 

Given the initial state:
- `scount[0]` is greater than 0 (unless `i` was 0, in which case it would no longer be greater than 0).
- `scount[i]` is greater than 0 (it must be greater than 1 at the start of the current iteration, but now it must be greater than 0 for the next iteration).
- `res` contains one more element which is a character corresponding to `i + ord('a')`.

After the code runs, the character corresponding to `i + ord('a')` is appended to `res`. Since the initial state already specifies that `res` contains one more element corresponding to `i + ord('a')`, the value of `res` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`scount[0]` is greater than 0 (unless `i` was 0, in which case it would no longer be greater than 0), `scount[i]` is greater than 0, `res` contains one more element which is a character corresponding to `i + ord('a')`.**
