Output State: **`res` is a list containing the first `works` characters from `t` plus an additional character `chr(j + ord('a'))` for each valid `j` (where `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1 <= j < 26` and `scount[j] > 0`). For each such `j`, `scount[j]` is decreased by 1. `works` remains the same unless the loop is executed 26 - `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` times, in which case `works` will be incremented to 0.**
