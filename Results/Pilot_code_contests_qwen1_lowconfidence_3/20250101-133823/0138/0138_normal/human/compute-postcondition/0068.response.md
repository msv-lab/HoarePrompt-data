`t` is a list containing 'b' repeated `scount[1]` times followed by an additional 'b'; `i` is 1. The code appends the character whose ASCII value is `i + ord('a')` to the list `t`. Since `i` is 1, `chr(1 + ord('a'))` is `c`. Therefore, `t` becomes a list containing 'b' repeated `scount[1]` times followed by an additional 'b' and then 'c'.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `t` is a list containing 'b' repeated `scount[1]` times followed by 'b' and 'c'; `scount[1]` must be greater than 0**
