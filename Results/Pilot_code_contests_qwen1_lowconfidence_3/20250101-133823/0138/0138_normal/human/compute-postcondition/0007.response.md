The code snippet updates the `scount` list to increment the count of the character `char` by 1. Given the initial state:

- `scount` is a list where the element at index `ord(char) - ord('a')` is 1.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input.
- `t` is a list of characters from the input.
- `tcount` is a list of 26 zeros, representing the counts of each character in the string `t`.
- `char` is the first character from the list `s`.

The code snippet `scount[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1` increments the count of the character `char` in the `scount` list. Since `scount[ord(char) - ord('a')]` was initially 1, it will become 2 after the increment.

Here is the step-by-step calculation:

1. `scount[ord(char) - ord('a')]` was 1.
2. Incrementing this value by 1 changes it to 2.

Therefore, the updated state of `scount` at the end of this operation is that the element at index `ord(char) - ord('a')` is now 2.

Output State: **`scount` is [0, ..., 0, 2, 0, ..., 0], `s` is a list of characters from the input, `t` is a list of characters from the input, `tcount` is a list of 26 zeros, `char` is the next character in the list `s`**
