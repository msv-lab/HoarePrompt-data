The given code snippet appends a character to the list `res`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the list `res` or the value of `i`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact character that gets appended. We can only state that the character appended to `res` is `chr(i + ord('a'))`.

Output State: **`res` is a list with one additional element `chr(i + ord('a'))`, `i` is unchanged**
