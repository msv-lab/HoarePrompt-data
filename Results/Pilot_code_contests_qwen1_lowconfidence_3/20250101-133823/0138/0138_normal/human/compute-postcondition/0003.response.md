The code initializes `tcount` as a list of 26 zeros. This does not affect the values of `scount`, `s`, or `t`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `tcount` and retains the initial states of `scount`, `s`, and `t`.

Output State: **`scount` is a list of 26 zeros, `s` is a list of characters from the input, `t` is a list of characters from the input, `tcount` is a list of 26 zeros**
