Postcondition: ***`scount` must have at least one element (len(scount) > 0), `i` is 0, `tcount` is a list of integers, `allgreater` is either `True` or `False`, `works` is -1, `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount`. `cando` is `True` if `scountcopy[j] > 0` for any `j` in the range `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25, otherwise `cando` remains `True`.***
