Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `scount[0]` is greater than 0 (unless `i` was 0, in which case it would no longer be greater than 0).
   - `scount[i]` is decreased by 1.
   - `res` contains one more element which is a character corresponding to `i + ord('a')`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `while scount[i] > 0:`.

3. **Determining Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `scount[i] > 0` must still hold true.
   - From the given information, we know that `scount[i]` has already been decreased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, for the loop to continue, `scount[i]` must still be greater than 0 after this decrease.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `scount[i]` has been decreased by 1, it means `scount[i]` was greater than 1 at the start of the current iteration.
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, `scount[i]` must still be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

Given this reasoning, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `scount[i]` must be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

**Final State:**
- `scount[0]` is greater than 0 (unless `i` was 0, in which case it would no longer be greater than 0).
- `scount[i]` is greater than 0 (it must be greater than 1 at the start of the current iteration, but now it must be greater than 0 for the next iteration).
- `res` contains one more element which is a character corresponding to `i + ord('a')`.

State: **`scount[0]` is greater than 0 (unless `i` was 0), `scount[i]` is greater than 0, `res` contains one more element which is a character corresponding to `i + ord('a')`**
