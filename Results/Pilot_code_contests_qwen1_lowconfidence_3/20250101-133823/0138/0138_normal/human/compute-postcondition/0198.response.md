`res` appends the character corresponding to `i + ord('a')`. The value of `i` must be such that `scount[i]` is greater than 0, and `scount[j]` is 0 for all `j != i`. The state of `scount` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is that `res` now includes the character corresponding to `i + ord('a')`.

Output State: **`res` contains 'z' and the character corresponding to `i + ord('a')`, `scount[i]` is greater than 0, and `scount[j]` is 0 for all `j != i`**
