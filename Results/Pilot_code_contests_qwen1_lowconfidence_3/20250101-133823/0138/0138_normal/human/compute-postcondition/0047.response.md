`scount[i]` is decremented by 1. Given that `i` is 0, `scount[0]` is decremented by 1. The initial condition that `scount[0]` must be greater than or equal to 1 is maintained, so after decrementing, `scount[0]` will be at least 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `'a'` is in `t`; `scount[0]` is at least 0**
