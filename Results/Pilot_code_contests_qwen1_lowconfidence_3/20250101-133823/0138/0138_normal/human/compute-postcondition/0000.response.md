The code `s = list(raw_input())` takes an input from the user, converts it into a list of characters, and assigns this list to the variable `s`. The variable `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a list of characters from the input, `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, with lengths satisfying 1 ≤ |t| ≤ 5000.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input, `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, with lengths satisfying 1 ≤ |t| ≤ 5000.**
