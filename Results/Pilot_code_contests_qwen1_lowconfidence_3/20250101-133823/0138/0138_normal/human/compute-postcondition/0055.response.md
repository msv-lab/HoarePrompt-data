`scount[i]` is decremented by 1, where `i` is 1. So `scount[1]` is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1; `scount[1]` is now equal to its original value minus 1; `t` is ['b'].

Output State: **`i` is 1; `scount[1]` is its original value minus 1; `t` is ['b']**
