Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing the first `works` characters from `t` plus an additional character `chr((ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 2) + ord('a'))`. If `scount[j]` was greater than 0, `scount[j]` is decreased by 1, and `chr(ord(t[works]) + 2)` is added to `res`. If `scount[j]` was not greater than 0, the list `res` remains unchanged.***
