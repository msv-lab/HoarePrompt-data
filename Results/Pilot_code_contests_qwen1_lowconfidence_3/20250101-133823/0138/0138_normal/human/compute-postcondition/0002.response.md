The code initializes a list `scount` with 26 zeros. This list is used to count the occurrences of each letter in the alphabet in the list `s`. The variable `t` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `scount` is a list of 26 zeros, `s` is a list of characters from the input, `t` is a list of characters from the input.

Output State: **`scount` is a list of 26 zeros, `s` is a list of characters from the input, `t` is a list of characters from the input**
