Output State: **`res` is the concatenation of the first `works` characters from `t` plus an additional character `a` for each valid `j` where `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1 <= j < 26` and `scount[j] > 0`, `scount[i]` is 0 for all `i` such that `scount[i]` was greater than 0 initially, `i` is 26, and `works` is 0 if the loop did not execute 26 times, otherwise `works` is the index of the last character that was used to form `res`.**
