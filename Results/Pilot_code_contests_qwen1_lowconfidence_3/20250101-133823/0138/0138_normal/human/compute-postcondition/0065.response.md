`t` is a list containing 'b' repeated `scount[1]` times, and `scount[1]` must be greater than 0. The value of `i` is 1. The code appends the character obtained by adding the ASCII value of 'a' to `i` to the list `t`. Since `i` is 1, `chr(i + ord('a'))` results in 'b'. Therefore, the list `t` will have one additional 'b' appended to it.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `t` is a list containing 'b' repeated `scount[1]` times followed by an additional 'b'; `scount[1]` must be greater than 0**
