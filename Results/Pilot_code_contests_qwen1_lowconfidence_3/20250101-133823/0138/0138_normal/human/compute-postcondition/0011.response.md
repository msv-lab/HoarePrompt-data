Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `scount` is a list of 26 integers where each integer represents the count of a corresponding character from 'a' to 'z' in the string `s`.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input.
- `t` is a list of characters from the input.
- `tcount` is a list of 26 zeros.
- `char` is the last character processed in the list `s` if the loop executed at least once. If the loop did not execute, `scount` remains a list of 26 zeros.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for char in t:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the list `t`. Therefore, the loop can only execute if the list `t` is non-empty (i.e., contains at least one character).
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since `t` is a list of characters from the input, we need to ensure that `t` is non-empty for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `char` will be set to the current character being processed in the list `t` during each iteration of the loop.

### Final State Adjustment:
For the loop to execute, `t` must contain at least one character. The other variables (`scount`, `s`, `tcount`, and `char`) are either initialized or will be modified within the loop body and don't affect the loop's execution condition directly.

### Conclusion:
State: **`t` must have at least one character**.

This ensures that the loop can start executing.
