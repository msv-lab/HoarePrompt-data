Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `scount[ord(char) - ord('a')]` for each character `char` in `t` is decremented by 1.
- `tcount` and `allgreater` are unchanged.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(26):
    while scount[i] > 0:
        t.append(chr(i + ord('a')))
        scount[i] -= 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Outer Loop (for i in range(26))**:
   - This loop iterates over the alphabet from 'a' to 'z'.
   - For each iteration, it processes the count of the corresponding character in `scount`.

2. **Inner Loop (while scount[i] > 0)**:
   - This loop continues as long as there are remaining occurrences of the character corresponding to index `i`.
   - It appends the character to the list `t` and decrements the count in `scount[i]`.

### Step-by-Step Execution:
- **First Iteration (i = 0, character 'a')**:
  - If `scount[0] > 0`, append 'a' to `t` and decrement `scount[0]`.
- **Second Iteration (i = 1, character 'b')**:
  - If `scount[1] > 0`, append 'b' to `t` and decrement `scount[1]`.
- ...
- **Last Iteration (i = 25, character 'z')**:
  - If `scount[25] > 0`, append 'z' to `t` and decrement `scount[25]`.

### Final State:
- After all iterations, `scount[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 25 will be 0 because all characters have been appended to `t` and their counts in `scount` have been exhausted.
- `t` will contain the string formed by appending characters from 'a' to 'z' according to their counts in `scount`.

### Output State:
- `t` will be a list containing the string formed by characters from 'a' to 'z' repeated according to their counts in `scount`.
- All values in `scount` will be 0.
- `i` will be 26 (after the last iteration).

### Conclusion:
- The loop will execute exactly as many times as there are non-zero values in `scount`, appending characters to `t` until all counts are exhausted.
- Once all counts are zero, the loop will terminate.

**Output State:**
**`t` is a list containing the string formed by characters from 'a' to 'z' repeated according to their counts in `scount`, all values in `scount` are 0, and `i` is 26.**
