Postcondition: ***`scount` must have at least one element, `i` is 2, `j` is `ord(t[2]) - ord('a') + n`, `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount` with the value at index `j` decreased by `n`, `tcount` is a list of integers, `allgreater` is either `True` or `False`, `cando` is `True`, `works` is 2, `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0 after `n` iterations, and `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is equal to 0.***
