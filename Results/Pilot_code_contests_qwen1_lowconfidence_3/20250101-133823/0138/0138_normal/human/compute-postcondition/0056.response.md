Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `scount[i] > 0`.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `i` is 1.
   - `scount[1]` is its original value minus 1.
   - `t` is ['b'].

3. **Determine the Requirement for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `scount[i]` must be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since `i` is 1, we need `scount[1] > 0`.

4. **Analyze the Current Value**:
   - `scount[1]` is its original value minus 1. This means that `scount[1]` was originally greater than 1 because subtracting 1 from it results in a positive number.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `scount[1]` must be greater than 0. Given that `scount[1]` is originally greater than 1 and is reduced by 1, it must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

6. **Final State**:
   - We need to ensure that `scount[1]` is greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `scount[1]` must be greater than 0, `t` is ['b']**
