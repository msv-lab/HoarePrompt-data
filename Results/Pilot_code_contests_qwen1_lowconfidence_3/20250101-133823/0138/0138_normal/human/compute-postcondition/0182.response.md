Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `res` is the concatenation of the first `works` characters from `t` plus an additional character `a` for each valid `j` where `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1 <= j < 26` and `scount[j] > 0`.
   - `scount[i]` is 0 for all `i` such that `scount[i]` was greater than 0 initially.
   - `i` is 26.
   - `works` is 0 if the loop did not execute 26 times, otherwise `works` is the index of the last character that was used to form `res`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(26)`, meaning it will iterate from `0` to `25`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The value of `i` starts at 26.
   - The loop will execute if `i` is within the range `0` to `25`.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition checks if `i` is in the range `0` to `25`, the loop will execute one more time when `i` becomes `0`.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `i` is `0` and all other relevant variables remain as they are.

5. **Updated State**:
   - `res` remains unchanged.
   - `scount[i]` remains 0 for all `i` such that `scount[i]` was greater than 0 initially.
   - `i` becomes `0`.
   - `works` remains the same as the previous iteration.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`res` is the concatenation of the first `works` characters from `t` plus an additional character `a` for each valid `j` where `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1 <= j < 26` and `scount[j] > 0`, `scount[i]` is 0 for all `i` such that `scount[i]` was greater than 0 initially, `i` is 0, and `works` is 0 if the loop did not execute 26 times, otherwise `works` is the index of the last character that was used to form `res`.**
