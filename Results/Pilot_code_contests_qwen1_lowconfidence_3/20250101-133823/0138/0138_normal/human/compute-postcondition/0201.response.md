`res` appends the character corresponding to `i + ord('a')`. The value of `i` is such that `scount[i]` must be greater than 0. The appended character is `chr(i + ord('a'))`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`res` contains 'z', the character corresponding to `i + ord('a')`, `scount[i]` must be greater than 0**
