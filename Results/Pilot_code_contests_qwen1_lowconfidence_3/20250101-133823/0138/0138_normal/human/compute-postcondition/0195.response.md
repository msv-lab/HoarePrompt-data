The code snippet appends the character corresponding to the current value of `i` (which is 26) to the list `res`. According to the initial state, `scount[26]` must be greater than 0, and `scount[i]` is 0 for all `i` such that `scount[i]` was initially greater than 0. Since `i` is 26, the condition `scount[i] > 0` is satisfied, and the character appended to `res` will be the 26th letter of the alphabet, which is 'z'.

The output state after the code execution is:
Output State: **`res` contains 'z', `scount[26]` is greater than 0, and `scount[i]` is 0 for all other i**
