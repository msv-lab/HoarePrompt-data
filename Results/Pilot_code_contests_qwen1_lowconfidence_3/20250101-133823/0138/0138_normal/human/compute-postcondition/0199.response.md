`scount[i]` is decremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `scount[i]` is greater than 0, so after decrementing by 1, `scount[i]` will be one less than its original value. The other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` contains 'z' and the character corresponding to `i + ord('a')`, `scount[i]` is greater than 0 and equals its original value minus 1, and `scount[j]` is 0 for all `j != i`.**
