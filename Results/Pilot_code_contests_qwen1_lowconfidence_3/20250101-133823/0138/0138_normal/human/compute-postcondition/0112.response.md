Postcondition: ***`scount` must have at least one element, `i` is 2, `j` is `ord(t[2]) - ord('a') + n` where `n` is the number of iterations of the loop and must be a valid index and less than 26, `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount` with the value at index `j` decreased by `n`, `tcount` is a list of integers, `allgreater` is either `True` or `False`, `cando` is `True`, `works` is set to `-1`, and `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0 after `n` iterations, and the condition `(cando)` is true***
