The code appends a character to the list `t`. The character is generated by converting the integer `i` to its corresponding ASCII character using `chr(i + ord('a'))`. Given that `i` is initially 0, the character appended to `t` will be 'a'. 

- The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not reassigned or modified within the code snippet.
- The value of `scount[0]` is not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`i` is 0; `'a'` is appended to `t`; `scount[0]` must be greater than 0**
