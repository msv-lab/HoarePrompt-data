Postcondition: **`scount` must have at least one element, `i` is the length of `s`, `tcount` is a list of integers, `allgreater` is either `True` or `False`, `cando` remains `True`, `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount` with the value at index `ord(t[i]) - ord('a')` decreased by 1 for each character `t[i]` in `s` for which `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] > 0`, `works` is `-1` since the inner loop did not find any valid index, and the loop breaks if `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] == 0` for any `i`.**
