The code `t = list(raw_input())` takes the input from the user, which is expected to be a string of lowercase Latin letters, and converts it into a list of characters. This means that the variable `t` now holds this list of characters, while `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input, `t` is a list of characters from the input**
