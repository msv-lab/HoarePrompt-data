According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `works`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `works`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were observed:
- `works` is greater than 0.
- `res` contains the element `t[i]` appended to it.
- `scount[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is decreased by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must hold:
- `i` must be less than `works`.
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, after the current iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
- Therefore, for the loop to continue, `i + 1` must be less than `works`.

Given that `i` was used in the previous iteration, let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`. Hence, `i_end + 1` must be less than `works`.

Let's summarize the updated states:
- `works` remains greater than 0 (since it hasn't changed yet).
- `res` will contain the next element from `t[i+1]` appended to it.
- `scount[ord(t[i+1]) - ord('a')]` will be decreased by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`works` is greater than 1, `res` contains the element `t[i+1]` appended to it, `scount[ord(t[i+1]) - ord('a')]` is decreased by 1**
