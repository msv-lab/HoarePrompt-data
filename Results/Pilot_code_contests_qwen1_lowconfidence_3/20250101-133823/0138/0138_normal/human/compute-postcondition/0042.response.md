According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `scount[i]`. If `scount[i]` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute the first time, `scount[0]` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `scount[0]` is greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 0 and `scount[0]` must be greater than 0**
