`res` appends the character corresponding to `i + ord('a')`. Since `res` already contains one more element which is a character corresponding to `i + ord('a')`, appending the same character again means `res` now contains two elements, both being the character corresponding to `i + ord('a')`. The values of `scount[0]` and `scount[i]` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them. Therefore, the Output State is: `scount[0]` is greater than 0; `scount[i]` is greater than 0; `res` contains two elements, both being the character corresponding to `i + ord('a')`.

Output State: **`scount[0]` is greater than 0; `scount[i]` is greater than 0; `res` contains two elements, both being the character corresponding to `i + ord('a')`**
