`scount[i]` is decremented by 1. Given that `i` is 0 and `scount[0]` must be greater than 0, the value of `scount[0]` will be reduced by 1. Since `i` was initially 0, after the operation `scount[0] -= 1`, `scount[0]` will be `scount[0] - 1`.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `'a'` is appended to `t`; `scount[0]` is `scount[0] - 1`.**
