The code appends a character to the list `res`. The character appended is `chr(j + ord('a'))`. Given the initial state, the value of `j` is not specified, but it is assumed to be an integer. The character `chr(j + ord('a'))` will be a lowercase letter corresponding to the integer value of `j` plus the ASCII value of 'a'. 

The states of the other variables (`res`, `scount`) are not directly impacted by this line of code except that `res` will now contain one additional element.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`res` is a list containing the first `works` characters from `t` plus an additional character `chr(j + ord('a'))`, `scount` is initialized based on the characters in `res`, and `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` is less than or equal to 25. The current value of `scount[j]` is greater than 0.**
