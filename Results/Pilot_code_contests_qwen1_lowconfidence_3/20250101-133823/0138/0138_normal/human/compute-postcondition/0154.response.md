Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to `25`.
   - This means the loop will start from the ordinal value of `t[works]` (converted to an index starting from 0) and go up to 25.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables:**
   - `res` is a list containing the first `works` characters from `t`.
   - For each character `t[i]` in `res`, `scount[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is decreased by 1.
   - `scount` is a list where `scount[k]` represents the count of the k-th character ('a' to 'z') in the string `s`.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute:**
   - The loop starts from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` and goes up to 25.
   - For the loop to execute, `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` must be less than or equal to 25.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that the condition `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1 <= 25` holds true.
   - Additionally, we need to confirm the state of `res` and `scount`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `res` should contain the first `works` characters from `t`.
- `scount` should be initialized appropriately based on the characters in `res` as described.
- `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` must be less than or equal to 25.

So, the final state is:

State: **`res` is a list containing the first `works` characters from `t`, `scount` is initialized based on the characters in `res`, and `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` must be less than or equal to 25**
