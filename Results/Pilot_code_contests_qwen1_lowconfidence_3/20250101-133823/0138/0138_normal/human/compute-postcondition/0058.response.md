`scount[i]` is decremented by 1. Given that `i` is 1, `scount[1]` is decreased by 1. Since `scount[1]` must be greater than 0, after decrementing by 1, `scount[1]` will be a positive value less than its original value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `scount[1]` is a positive value less than its original value; `t` is `['b', 'b']`**
