Postcondition: ***`scount` must have at least one element (len(scount) > 0), `i` is 0, `tcount` is a list of integers, `allgreater` is either `True` or `False`, `cando` is `True` if `scountcopy[j] > 0` for any `j` in the range `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25, otherwise `cando` remains `True`, `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount`, `works` is set to `-1`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out if `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] == 0`***
