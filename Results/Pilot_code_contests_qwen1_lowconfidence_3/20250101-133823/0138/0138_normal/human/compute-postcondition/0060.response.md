`t` is a list that contains the elements 'b', 'b'. The code appends a character to the list `t`. The character is calculated as `chr(i + ord('a'))`, where `i` is 1. The value of `ord('a')` is 97, so `i + ord('a')` is 1 + 97, which equals 98. The character corresponding to the ASCII value 98 is 'b'. Therefore, the list `t` is updated to include the character 'b'. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `scount[1]` must be greater than 0; `t` is `['b', 'b', 'b']`**
