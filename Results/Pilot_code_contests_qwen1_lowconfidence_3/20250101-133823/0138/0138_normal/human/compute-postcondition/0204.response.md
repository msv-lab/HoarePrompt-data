Output State: **`res` is the concatenation of all characters corresponding to the indices where `scount[i]` was originally greater than 0, `scount[i]` for all `i` is 0, and `i` ranges from 0 to 25.** 

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to 25. For each `i` where `scount[i]` is greater than 0, the loop appends `chr(i + ord('a'))` to `res` and decrements `scount[i]` by 1.
2. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until `scount[i]` is 0 for all `i` from 0 to 25.
3. **Final State**: After the loop completes, `res` will contain all characters corresponding to the indices where `scount[i]` was originally greater than 0, and `scount[i]` for all `i` will be 0.

Since the loop runs through all possible values of `i` (from 0 to 25) and ensures that `scount[i]` is decremented to 0 for all valid indices, the final state of `res` will be the concatenation of all characters corresponding to the indices where `scount[i]` was originally greater than 0.
