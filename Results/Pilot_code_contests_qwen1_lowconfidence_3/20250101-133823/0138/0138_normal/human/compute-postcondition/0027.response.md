`allgreater` is explicitly set to `False`. The values of `scount[i]` and `tcount[i]` remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them. Therefore, the Output State is: `scount[i]` and `tcount[i]` are integers; `allgreater` is `False`.

Output State: **`scount[i]` and `tcount[i]` are integers; `allgreater` is `False`**
