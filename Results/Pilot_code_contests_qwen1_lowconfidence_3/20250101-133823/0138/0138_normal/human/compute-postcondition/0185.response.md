`scount[i]` is decremented by 1. Given that `scount[0]` was initially greater than 0, it remains greater than 0 unless `i` is 0. The value of `res` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated state is: `scount[0]` is greater than 0 (unless `i` was 0, in which case it would no longer be greater than 0); `scount[i]` is decreased by 1; `res` contains one more element which is a character corresponding to `i + ord('a')`.

Output State: **`scount[0]` is greater than 0 (unless i was 0, in which case it would no longer be greater than 0); `scount[i]` is decreased by 1; `res` contains one more element which is a character corresponding to `i + ord('a')`**
