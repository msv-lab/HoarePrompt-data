`tcount` is incremented at the index corresponding to the character `char` (converted to its ASCII value and adjusted by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a'). The initial state is that `t` must have at least two characters, and the count of character `char` in `tcount` is incremented by 1.

After executing the line of code `tcount[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1`, the count of the character `char` in the list `tcount` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `t` must have at least two characters.
- The count of the character `char` in `tcount` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` must have at least two characters; the count of character `char` in `tcount` is incremented by 1**
