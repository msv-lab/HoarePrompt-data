`t` is a list that has the character 'a' appended to it. The value of `i` is 0, so `chr(i + ord('a'))` evaluates to 'a'. Therefore, 'a' is appended to `t`. The value of `scount[0]` must still be greater than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `'a'` is in `t`; `scount[0]` must be greater than or equal to 1**
