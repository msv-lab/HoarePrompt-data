Output State: **`scount` must have at least one element (len(scount) > 0), `i` is 0, `tcount` is a list of integers, `allgreater` is either `True` or `False`, `works` is -1, `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount`, `cando` is `True` if `scountcopy[j] > 0` for any `j` in the range `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25, otherwise `cando` remains `False`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Values and Conditions**:
   - `scount` must have at least one element (`len(scount) > 0`).
   - `i` starts at 0.
   - `tcount` is a list of integers.
   - `allgreater` is either `True` or `False`.
   - `works` is initialized to -1.
   - `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount`.
   - `cando` starts as `False`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the range `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25.
   - For each iteration, `j` is checked to see if `scountcopy[j] > 0`.
   - If `scountcopy[j] > 0` for any `j` in this range, `cando` is set to `True`.

3. **Final State After All Iterations**:
   - After all iterations of the loop, `cando` will be `True` if there exists any `j` in the specified range such that `scountcopy[j] > 0`.
   - If no such `j` exists, `cando` will remain `False`.

Thus, the final state after all iterations of the loop will reflect whether any character corresponding to the range `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 has a count greater than zero in `scountcopy`.
