Postcondition: ***`scount` must have at least one element, `i` is 3, `j` is `ord(t[3]) - ord('a') + n + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop has executed, `j` is always less than 26, `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount` with the value at index `j + 1` (i.e., the index that would have been checked in the next iteration) decreased by `n` after each execution of the loop, `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is decreased by 1, `tcount` is a list of integers, `allgreater` is either `True` or `False`, `cando` is `True`, `works` is 2, `t[3]` is a valid character, and `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0 after the if condition is met for all iterations, unless the loop does not execute at all, and the if condition `(cando)` is true.***
