`t` is a list that contains strings repeated based on the initial value of `scount[0]`, which is 0. This means initially, `t` is empty. The code appends the character corresponding to `i` to `t`. Since `i` is 1, `chr(i + ord('a'))` evaluates to `b` (as `ord('a')` is 97 and `1 + 97` equals 98, which corresponds to 'b'). Therefore, `t` will now contain the string `'b'`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `scount[1]` must be greater than 0; `t` is ['b']**
