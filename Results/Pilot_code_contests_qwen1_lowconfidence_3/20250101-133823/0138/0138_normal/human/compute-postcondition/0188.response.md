`scount[i]` is decremented by 1. The value of `scount[i]` was greater than 0, so it is now decreased by 1 but remains greater than 0 unless it became exactly 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`scount[0]` is greater than 0, `scount[i]` is greater than 0 minus 1, `res` contains one more element which is a character corresponding to `i + ord('a')`.**
