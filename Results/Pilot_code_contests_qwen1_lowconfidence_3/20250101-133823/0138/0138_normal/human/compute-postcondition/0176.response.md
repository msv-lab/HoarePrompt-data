The code snippet appends a character to the list `res`. Specifically, it appends `chr(i + ord('a'))` to `res`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the given context. Given the initial state, we know that `res` is a list containing the first `works` characters from `t` plus an additional character `a` for each valid `j` where `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1 <= j < 26` and `scount[j] > 0`. The variable `works` is set to allow the loop to potentially execute all 26 iterations, and `scount[i]` must be greater than 1.

Since `i` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can infer that the code will append a character corresponding to the ASCII value of `i + ord('a')` to `res`.

Given this, the output state will be:

Output State: **`res` is a list containing the first `works` characters from `t` plus an additional character `a` for each valid `j` where `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1 <= j < 26` and `scount[j] > 0`, and `res` is appended with `chr(i + ord('a'))`.**
