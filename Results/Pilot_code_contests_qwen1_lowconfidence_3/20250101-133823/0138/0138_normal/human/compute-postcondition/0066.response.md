`scount[i]` is decremented by 1. Given that `i` is initially 1 and `scount[1]` must be greater than 0, the value of `scount[1]` is decreased by 1. The state of `t` and the value of `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `t` is a list containing 'b' repeated `scount[1]` times followed by an additional 'b'; `scount[1]` is `scount[1] - 1`.**
