Postcondition: **`scount` must have at least one element (len(scount) > 0), `i` is 0, `tcount` is a list of integers, `allgreater` is either `True` or `False`, `works` is -1, `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount`, `cando` is `False`, `t[0]` should be a valid character such that `ord(t[0]) - ord('a') + 1` is between 1 and 25, and the current value of `j` is such that `scountcopy[j] > 0`.**
