Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0.
   - `cando` is True.
   - If `scountcopy[j]` is not greater than 0, the state of the program remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts from `j = ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` and goes up to `j = 25`.
   - For each value of `j`, the loop body is executed.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the specified range (i.e., `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25).

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop is based on the value of `j`, we need to check if the next value of `j` falls within the specified range.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `scountcopy[j]` was greater than 0 and `cando` was True.
   - To proceed to the next iteration, `j` must be incremented by 1, but it must still be within the range `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25.

6. **Next Value of `j`:**
   - If `j` is at the current maximum value in the range (i.e., `25`), then the loop will terminate.
   - If `j` is less than 25, it will be incremented by 1, and the loop will continue.

7. **New State for the Next Iteration:**
   - If `j` is currently 25, the state remains unchanged because the loop will terminate.
   - If `j` is less than 25, `j` will be incremented by 1, and the loop will continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will depend on whether `j` is at its maximum value or not. However, since the exact value of `j` is not specified, we can only provide a general answer based on the condition.

**State:**
- `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0.
- `cando` is True.
- `j` is incremented by 1, and it must still be within the range `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25.

So, the new state is:
**`scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0, `cando` is True, and `j` is incremented by 1 (but must still be within the range `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25).**
