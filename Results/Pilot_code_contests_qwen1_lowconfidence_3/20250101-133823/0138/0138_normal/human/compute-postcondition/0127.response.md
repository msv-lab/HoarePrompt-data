Postcondition: ***`scount` must have at least one element, `i` is 3, `j` is `ord(t[3]) - ord('a') + n + 1` and the new value of `j` is less than 26, `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount` with the value at index `j` decreased by `n`, `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is decreased by 1, `tcount` is a list of integers, `allgreater` is either `True` or `False`, `cando` is `True`, `works` is 2, `t[3]` is a valid character, and `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0 after the if condition is met. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the if part.***
