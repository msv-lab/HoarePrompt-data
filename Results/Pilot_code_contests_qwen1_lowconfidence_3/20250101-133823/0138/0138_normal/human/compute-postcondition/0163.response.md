The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Given that there is no loop or conditional block within the provided code snippet, the only impact is that we break out of the implied context. 

The variables `res`, `scount[k]`, and `k` are updated according to the initial state, and the `break` statement does not alter these values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing the first `works` characters from `t` plus an additional character `chr((ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 2) + ord('a'))` and the character `chr(ord(t[works]) + 2)`, `scount[k]` is decreased by 1, and `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 2` is `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
