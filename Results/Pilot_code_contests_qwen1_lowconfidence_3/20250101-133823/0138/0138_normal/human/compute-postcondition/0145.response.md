`res.append(t[i])` appends the element `t[i]` to the list `res`. However, the initial state does not provide any specific values for `res` or `t`, only that `works` must be greater than 0. Since no specific values for `res` or `t` are given, we can only say that `t[i]` has been added to `res`.

Output State: **`works` is greater than 0; `res` contains the element `t[i]` appended to it**
