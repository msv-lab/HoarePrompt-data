`scount[i]` is decremented by 1. Given that `i` is 0, this means `scount[0]` is decreased by 1. The initial state was that `scount[0]` must be greater than 0. After decrementing by 1, `scount[0]` will be a value that is still greater than 0 (since it started as a positive number and was only reduced by 1). The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `'a'` is in `t`; `scount[0]` is a value greater than 0 (specifically, one less than its original value)**
