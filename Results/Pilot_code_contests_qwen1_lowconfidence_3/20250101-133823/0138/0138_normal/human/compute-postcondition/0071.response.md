`t` is a list, and the code appends to this list. Specifically, it appends the character whose ASCII value is `i + ord('a')`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `i` or the content of the list `t`. Since `ord('a')` is 97, the character appended to `t` will be `chr(97 + i)`, which is the character at position `i` in the alphabet starting from 'a'. 

Given this, without a specific value for `i`, we can say that `t` now contains one additional element compared to its initial state. 

Output State: **`t` is a list with an additional element `chr(97 + i)` appended to it.**
