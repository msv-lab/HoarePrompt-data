Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `char` is the second character of `t`.
   - `scount[ord(char) - ord('a')]` is decremented by 1.
   - `tcount` is unchanged.
   - `allgreater` is unchanged.

2. **Loop Structure:**
   ```python
   for char in t:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `t`.
   - For each character `char` in `t`, the loop body is executed.
   - After the first iteration, `char` was the second character of `t`.

4. **State Adjustment for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `char` was the second character of `t`, it means we have already processed the first character.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `char` will be the third character of `t`.

5. **Modifying the States:**
   - `char` needs to be updated to the third character of `t`.
   - `scount[ord(char) - ord('a')]` will be decremented by 1 again for the new `char`.
   - `tcount` remains unchanged as it does not depend on the current character being processed.
   - `allgreater` remains unchanged as it does not change based on the current character being processed.

6. **Final State:**
   - `char` is now the third character of `t`.
   - `scount[ord(char) - ord('a')]` is decremented by 1.
   - `tcount` is unchanged.
   - `allgreater` is unchanged.

**State: **`char` is the third character of `t`, `scount[ord(char) - ord('a')]` is decremented by 1, `tcount` is unchanged, `allgreater` is unchanged**
