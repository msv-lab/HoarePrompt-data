According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `scount[i]`. The loop continues as long as `scount[i]` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `scount[i]` is greater than 0 and equals its original value minus 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `scount[i]` must still be greater than 0. Since it was greater than 0 in the previous iteration and has only decreased by 1 (from its original value), it means `scount[i]` must be at least 1 to allow the loop to continue.

No other states need to be adjusted because the conditions for the loop continuation do not depend on the values of `res` or the characters corresponding to `i + ord('a')`.

State: **`res` contains 'z' and the character corresponding to `i + ord('a')`, `scount[i]` must be greater than 0**
