`scountcopy` is assigned the value of `scount` by creating a new list that is a copy of `scount`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `scount` and `tcount` are lists of integers, and `allgreater` is either `True` or `False`; `works` is `-1`; `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount`.

Output State: **`scount` and `tcount` are lists of integers, and `allgreater` is either `True` or `False`; `works` is `-1`; `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount`.**
