Let's analyze the given code and the provided output states step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1
- `'a'` is repeated in `t` as many times as the original value of `scount[0]` was, so let's denote the original value of `scount[0]` as `sc0`
- `scount[0]` is 0
- Therefore, `t` is an empty list since `scount[0]` is 0.

### Code of the Loop:
```python
while scount[i] > 0:
    t.append(chr(i + ord('a')))
    scount[i] -= 1
```

### Analysis:
- The loop starts with `i` set to 1.
- The loop continues as long as `scount[i] > 0`.
- In each iteration, `chr(i + ord('a'))` is appended to `t`, and `scount[i]` is decremented by 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### After the loop executes 1 time:
- `i` is still 1.
- `scount[1]` is decremented by 1, making it `scount[1] - 1`.
- `t` now contains one element, which is `b`.

#### After the loop executes 2 times:
- `i` is still 1.
- `scount[1]` is decremented again, making it `scount[1] - 2`.
- `t` now contains two elements, both `b`.

#### After the loop executes 3 times:
- `i` is still 1.
- `scount[1]` is decremented again, making it `scount[1] - 3`.
- `t` now contains three elements, all `b`.

### General Pattern:
- Each time the loop runs, `scount[1]` is decremented by 1, and `b` is appended to `t`.
- The loop will continue to run as long as `scount[1] > 0`.
- Once `scount[1]` reaches 0, the loop will stop.

### Final Output State:
- `i` remains 1 because the loop only increments `i` inside the condition check, and the condition is based on `scount[i]`, which is `scount[1]`.
- `t` will contain `b` repeated `scount[1]` times, where `scount[1]` is the original value of `scount[0]` minus the number of times the loop has executed.
- `scount[1]` will be 0 after the loop completes.

### Conclusion:
The output state after the loop has executed is:
Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is a list containing 'b' repeated `scount[1]` times, `scount[1]` is 0**
