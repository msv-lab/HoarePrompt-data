Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible absolute difference of \(S_1\) and \(S_2\). The program attempts to find the minimum difference by iterating through the list and calculating the sum of elements before and after each index, but this approach does not consider all possible divisions of the list into two groups based on different values of \(T\).

For example, consider the input:

```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The program will only check the differences for \(T = 1, 2, 3, 4\), but the correct answer should be considering all possible \(T\) values from 1 to 4. The correct solution would involve checking each possible \(T\) and calculating the sum of weights for both groups, then finding the minimum difference.

Here's a correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    N = int(input())
    V = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(V)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    
    left_sum = 0
    for i in range(N-1):
        left_sum += V[i]
        right_sum = total_sum - left_sum
        min_diff = min(min_diff, abs(left_sum - right_sum))
    
    print(min_diff)

func()
```

This correct implementation iterates through all possible values of \(T\) (from 1 to \(N-1\)) and calculates the sums for both groups, then finds the minimum difference.
