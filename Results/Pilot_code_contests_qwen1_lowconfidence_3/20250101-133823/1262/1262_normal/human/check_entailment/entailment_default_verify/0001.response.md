Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly handle all possible divisions of the weights into two groups based on the index \(T\). Specifically, the program only iterates up to `len(V) - 1`, missing the critical step of considering the division at each index from 1 to \(N-1\). This oversight leads to an incomplete evaluation of the minimum possible absolute difference between \(S_1\) and \(S_2\). Therefore, the program fails to meet the problem description and the output hints do not support the correctness of the current implementation.
