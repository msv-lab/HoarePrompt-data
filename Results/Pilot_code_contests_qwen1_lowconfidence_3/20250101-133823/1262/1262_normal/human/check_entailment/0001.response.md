Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in how it calculates the sums \(S_1\) and \(S_2\). The program calculates the sum of the first \(i\) elements and the sum of the remaining elements but does not properly handle the division of weights into two groups based on the index \(T\).

The program should consider all possible values of \(T\) from 1 to \(N-1\) and calculate the absolute difference for each division. However, the current implementation only iterates up to `len(V) - 1` (which corresponds to \(N-1\)), and it does not correctly compute the sums for each possible division.

For example, consider the input:

```
4
1 3 1 1
```

The program would only check the divisions where \(T = 1\) and \(T = 2\), which are:
- \(T = 1\): \(S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\), \(S_2 = 1 + 1 = 2\), difference = 2
- \(T = 2\): \(S_1 = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5\), \(S_2 = 1 = 1\), difference = 4

However, the correct answer should also include the division where \(T = 3\):
- \(T = 3\): \(S_1 = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5\), \(S_2 = 1 = 1\), difference = 4

This example shows that the program does not consider all possible divisions, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
