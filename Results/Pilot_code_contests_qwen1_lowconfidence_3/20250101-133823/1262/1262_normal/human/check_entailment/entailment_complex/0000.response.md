Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of weights \( N \) and the list of weights \( W \) from standard input. It ensures that \( N \) is within the specified range (2 ≤ N ≤ 100) and each weight \( W_i \) is also within the specified range (1 ≤ W_i ≤ 100).

2. **Calculation of Minimum Absolute Difference**: The program iterates through all possible ways to split the list \( V \) at different indices \( i \) (from 1 to \( N-1 \)). For each split, it calculates the sum of the elements in the prefix (up to index \( i \)) and the sum of the elements in the suffix (from index \( i \) to \( N-1 \)). It then computes the absolute difference between these sums and keeps track of the minimum difference encountered.

3. **Output**: The program prints the minimum absolute difference found, which is the required output according to the problem description.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible absolute difference between the sum of the weights in the first part and the sum of the weights in the second part for all possible divisions. Therefore, the program is correct.
