Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality. The problem description asks for finding the minimum possible absolute difference between the sums of two groups of weights, where the first group contains weights from index 1 to T and the second group contains weights from index T+1 to N. However, the given code only iterates through the list once, calculating the difference between the sum of the prefix and the sum of the suffix for each possible split point. This approach does not guarantee finding the optimal T that minimizes the absolute difference.

To illustrate, consider the input:
```
8
27 23 76 2 3 5 62 52
```

The correct solution would involve checking all possible values of T from 1 to N-1 to find the one that minimizes the absolute difference between S1 and S2. The provided code does not implement this logic, leading to an incorrect result. For the given input, the correct minimum absolute difference is 2, but the provided code might not find this value due to the flawed approach.
