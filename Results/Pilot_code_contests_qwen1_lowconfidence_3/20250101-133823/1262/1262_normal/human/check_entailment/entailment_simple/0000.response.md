Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input `N` (the number of weights) and the list of weights `W`. It handles the constraints \(2 \leq N \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq W_i \leq 100\).

2. **Initialization**: The variable `M` is initialized to a very large value (`1000000000.0`) to ensure that any computed difference will be smaller initially.

3. **Loop through Possible Divisions**: The program iterates over all possible division points `i` from 1 to `N-1` (since \(1 \leq T < N\)). For each division point `i`, it calculates the sum of the weights in the first part `sum(V[:i])` and the sum of the weights in the second part `sum(V[i:])`.

4. **Compute Absolute Difference**: It computes the absolute difference between the sums of these two parts (`abs(sum(V[:i]) - sum(V[i:]))`) and updates `M` if this difference is smaller than the current value of `M`.

5. **Output the Result**: After the loop completes, the program prints the minimum absolute difference `M`.

Given the problem description, this approach ensures that the program finds the minimum possible absolute difference of \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) for all valid divisions \(T\). Therefore, the program is correct as it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
