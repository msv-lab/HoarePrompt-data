Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the code calculates the minimum absolute difference for all possible divisions of the list into two parts, but it only considers the division at index `i` (where `1 <= i < N`). However, the problem description requires considering all possible divisions, including the case where the first part is empty (i.e., `T = 0`) and the second part contains all elements, or vice versa. 

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 3 1 1
```

The code will only consider the differences at indices 1, 2, and 3, which are:
- For `i = 1`: `abs(1 - (3 + 1 + 1)) = 4`
- For `i = 2`: `abs((1 + 3) - (1 + 1)) = 0`
- For `i = 3`: `abs((1 + 3 + 1) - 1) = 2`

However, the correct solution should also consider the division where `T = 0`, i.e., the entire array in one part, and the division where `T = 4`, i.e., the entire array in the other part. This would yield the following additional cases:
- For `i = 0`: `abs(0 - (1 + 3 + 1 + 1)) = 5`
- For `i = 4`: `abs((1 + 3 + 1 + 1) - 0) = 5`

Thus, the minimum absolute difference should be `2`, which is the correct output for this example. The current implementation fails to consider these boundary cases, making the program incorrect.
