The function `func` accepts a list of integers `V` where the length of the list `N` satisfies 2 <= N <= 100, and each integer `V_i` in the list satisfies 1 <= V_i <= 100. After executing the code, the function calculates and returns the minimum absolute difference between the sum of any prefix and the sum of its corresponding suffix in the list `V`. There are no explicit return cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function prints the result `M` which is the minimum absolute difference. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
