Postcondition: **`N` is an integer equal to the input value, `V` is a list of integers equal to the input values split and converted to integers, and `V` must have at least 2 elements, `M` is 1000000000.0, `diff` is the absolute difference between the sum of the first `i` elements and the sum of the remaining elements in the list `V`. The current value of `diff` is such that `M` is greater than `diff`.**
