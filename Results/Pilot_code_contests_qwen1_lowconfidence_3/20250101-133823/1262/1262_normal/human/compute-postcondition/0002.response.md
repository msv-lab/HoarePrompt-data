The code assigns the value `1000000000.0` to the variable `M`. This does not affect the values of `N` or `V`. Therefore, the output state remains with `N` being an integer equal to the input value and `V` being a list of integers equal to the input values split and converted to integers.

Output State: **`N` is an integer equal to the input value; `V` is a list of integers equal to the input values split and converted to integers; `M` is 1000000000.0**
