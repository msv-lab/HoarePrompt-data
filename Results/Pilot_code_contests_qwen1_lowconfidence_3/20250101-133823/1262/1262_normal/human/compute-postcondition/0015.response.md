Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer equal to the input value, `V` is a list of integers equal to the input values split and converted to integers, `M` is `1000000000.0`, `i` is `len(V) - 1`, and `diff` is `abs(sum(V[:i]) - V[-1])`. If `M` (which is `1000000000.0`) is greater than `diff`, then `M` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `M` remains `1000000000.0` since there is no else part modifying it.***
