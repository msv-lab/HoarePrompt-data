Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer equal to the input value, `V` is a list of integers equal to the input values split and converted to integers, and `V` must have at least 2 elements. If `M` (which is initially `1000000000.0`) is greater than `diff`, then `M` is updated to `diff`. Otherwise, `M` remains `1000000000.0`.***
