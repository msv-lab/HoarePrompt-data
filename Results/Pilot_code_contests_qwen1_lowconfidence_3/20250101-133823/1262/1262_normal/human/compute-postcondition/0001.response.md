The code `V = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `V`. The variable `N` remains unchanged, and the original list `W` is no longer relevant since it was not used in the code.

Let's denote the input values as a space-separated sequence of integers. For example, if the input is "4 5 6", then `V` would be `[4, 5, 6]`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer equal to the input value.
- `W` is a list of `N` integers where \(1 \leq W_i \leq 100\) for all \(i\).

After executing the code, the list `W` is no longer relevant, and `V` holds the new list of integers.

Output State: **`N` is an integer equal to the input value; `V` is a list of integers equal to the input values split and converted to integers**.
