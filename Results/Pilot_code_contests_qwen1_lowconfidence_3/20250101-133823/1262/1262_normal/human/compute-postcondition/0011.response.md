Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer equal to the input value, `V` is a list of integers equal to the input values split and converted to integers, `M` is 1000000000.0, and `i` is len(V). Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition if the condition `M > diff` is true.***
