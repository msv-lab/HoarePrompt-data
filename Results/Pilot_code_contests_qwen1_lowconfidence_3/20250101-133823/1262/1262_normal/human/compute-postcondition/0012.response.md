According to the code, the loop iterates over the range starting from 1 to the length of the list `V`. The variable `i` is used as the loop counter. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as follows:
- `N` is an integer equal to the input value.
- `V` is a list of integers equal to the input values split and converted to integers.
- `M` is 1000000000.0.
- `i` is `len(V)`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
- The loop condition is `i in range(1, len(V))`.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(V)`.

Since `i` is currently equal to `len(V)`, it does not satisfy the condition `i < len(V)`, meaning the loop will not execute again unless `i` is decreased to a value less than `len(V)`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `len(V) - 1`.

State: **`N` is an integer equal to the input value, `V` is a list of integers equal to the input values split and converted to integers, `M` is 1000000000.0, and `i` is `len(V) - 1`.**
