Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- \( N \) is an integer equal to the input value.
- \( V \) is a list of integers equal to the input values split and converted to integers.
- \( V \) must have at least 2 elements.
- \( M \) (which is initially \( 1000000000.0 \)) is updated if it is greater than \( \text{diff} \), where \( \text{diff} \) is calculated within the loop.

### Given Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, len(V)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop starts from \( i = 1 \) and goes up to \( i = \text{len}(V) - 1 \).
- At the end of the previous iteration, the loop variable \( i \) was \( \text{len}(V) - 1 \).

### Updating the States:
1. **Increment \( i \):**
   - Since the loop starts from \( i = 1 \) and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of \( i \) should be \( \text{len}(V) \).

2. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop condition is \( i < \text{len}(V) \).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, \( i \) must be less than \( \text{len}(V) \).
   - Therefore, the loop will continue if \( \text{len}(V) > i \).

Given the initial states and the analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- \( N \) remains the same as the input value.
- \( V \) remains the same list of integers.
- \( V \) must still have at least 2 elements.
- \( M \) remains the same because the update to \( M \) only happens if \( M \) is greater than \( \text{diff} \), and we don't know if this condition was met yet or what the new value of \( i \) is.

### Final State:
- \( i \) is \( \text{len}(V) \).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
**`N` is an integer equal to the input value, `V` is a list of integers equal to the input values split and converted to integers, and `V` must have at least 2 elements. If `M` (which is initially `1000000000.0`) is greater than `diff`, then `M` is updated to `diff`. Otherwise, `M` remains `1000000000.0`. `i` is `len(V)`**.
