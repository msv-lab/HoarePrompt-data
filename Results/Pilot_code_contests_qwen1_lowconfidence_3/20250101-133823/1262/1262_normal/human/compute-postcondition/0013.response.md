`diff` is assigned the absolute difference between the sum of the first `i` elements of `V` and the sum of the remaining elements in `V`. The value of `i` is `len(V) - 1`, which means the last element of `V` is included in both sums.

Let's denote the sum of the first `i` elements of `V` as `sum1` and the sum of the remaining elements as `sum2`. Since `i` is `len(V) - 1`, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `V` except the last one, and `sum2` is just the last element of `V`.

Therefore, `diff` is calculated as `abs(sum1 - V[-1])`, where `V[-1]` is the last element of `V`.

Given this, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer equal to the input value, `V` is a list of integers equal to the input values split and converted to integers, `M` is 1000000000.0, `i` is `len(V) - 1`, and `diff` is `abs(sum(V[:i]) - V[-1])`.**
