`N` is assigned the value of `input()`, which reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer. The initial value of `N` (which was an integer between 2 and 100) is replaced by the new input value. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer equal to the input value, and a list of `N` integers `W` where 1 <= `W_i` <= 100 for all `i`.**
