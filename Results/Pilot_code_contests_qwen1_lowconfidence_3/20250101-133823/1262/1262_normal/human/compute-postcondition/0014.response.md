`M` is assigned the value of `diff`, which is `abs(sum(V[:i]) - V[-1])`. The value of `M` is updated to this new value, but the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer equal to the input value, `V` is a list of integers equal to the input values split and converted to integers, `M` is `abs(sum(V[:i]) - V[-1])`, `i` is `len(V) - 1`, and `diff` is `abs(sum(V[:i]) - V[-1])`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer equal to the input value, `V` is a list of integers equal to the input values split and converted to integers, `M` is `abs(sum(V[:i]) - V[-1])`, `i` is `len(V) - 1`, and `diff` is `abs(sum(V[:i]) - V[-1])**.
