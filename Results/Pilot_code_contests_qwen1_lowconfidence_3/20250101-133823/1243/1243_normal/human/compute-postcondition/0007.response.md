According to the code, the loop iterates over each `word` in the `array`. The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `array`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions were true:
- `line` is a non-empty string starting with at least one `/`.
- `array` is a list of substrings from `line` split by `/`.
- `str` is `"/" + word` where `word` is the first substring in `array`.
- The current value of `word` is not an empty string.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next `word` in `array` must exist and `word` must not be an empty string. 

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Check the `array`:** Since the loop is iterating through `array`, the next execution requires `array` to have at least one more element. If `array` is exhausted, the loop will terminate.
2. **Check the `word`:** The condition for the loop to continue is that `word` (the current substring being processed) should not be an empty string. This is already satisfied since it was mentioned that `word` is the first substring in `array` and it is not an empty string.

Therefore, the key state adjustment needed is ensuring that `array` still has elements left for the loop to iterate over.

State: **`line` is a non-empty string starting with at least one '/', `array` is a list of substrings from `line` split by '/', `str` is '/' + `word` where `word` is the first substring in `array`, and `array` must have at least one more element.**
