In the initial state:
- `line` is a non-empty string starting with at least one '/'
- `array` is a list of substrings from `line` split by '/'
- `str` is '/' + `word` where `word` is the first substring in `array`, and `array` must have at least one more element.

The code snippet is:
```
str = str + '/' + word.strip()
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The value of `str` is currently set as `/` + `word`, where `word` is the first element in `array`.
2. `word.strip()` removes any leading and trailing whitespace from `word`.
3. The new value of `str` is updated to include an additional '/' followed by the stripped `word`.

Since `word` is the first element in `array` and it is stripped, the updated `str` will be `/` + (stripped `word`).

Output State: **`line` is a non-empty string starting with at least one '/', `array` is a list of substrings from `line` split by '/', `str` is '/' + (stripped `word`), and `array` must have at least one more element.**
