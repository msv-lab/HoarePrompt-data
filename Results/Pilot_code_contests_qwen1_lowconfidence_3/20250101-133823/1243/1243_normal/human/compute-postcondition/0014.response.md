The code `stdout.write(str)` writes the value of the variable `str` to the standard output. The value of `str` is defined as `"/" + (the concatenated result of stripping each non-empty word in `array` with a '/' separator)`. Since `array` is a list of substrings from `line` split by '/', and `line` starts with at least one '/', when we strip each non-empty word in `array`, the leading '/' will remain because all elements in `array` are non-empty (since `line` starts with at least one '/'). Thus, `str` is effectively just `line` itself.

Therefore, the standard output will write `line`, and the value of `str` will be the same as `line`. The variables `line` and `array` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`line` is a non-empty string starting with at least one '/'; `array` is a list of substrings from `line` split by '/'; `str` is `line`.**
