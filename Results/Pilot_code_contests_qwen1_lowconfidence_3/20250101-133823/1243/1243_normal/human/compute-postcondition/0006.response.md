Postcondition: ***`line` is a non-empty string starting with at least one '/', `array` is a list of substrings from `line` split by '/', `str` is '/' + `word` where `word` is the first substring in `array`, and the current value of `word` is not an empty string. Since there is no else part, the postcondition only considers the if part.***
