Output State: **`line` is a non-empty string starting with at least one '/', `array` is a list of substrings from `line` split by '/', `str` is '/' + (the concatenated result of stripping each non-empty word in `array` with a '/' separator).**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each word in the `array`.
- For each non-empty word, it appends the stripped version of the word to `str` with a '/' separator.
- After the loop completes, `str` will contain all the non-empty words from `array` with a '/' separator, starting with '/' since the first word in `array` is non-empty and starts the concatenation.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `array` is empty):
- `line` remains a non-empty string starting with at least one '/'.
- `array` is an empty list.
- `str` remains an empty string.

Thus, the final output state is as described above.
