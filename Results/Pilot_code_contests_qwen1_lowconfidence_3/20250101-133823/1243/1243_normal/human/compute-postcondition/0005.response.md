The code `str = str + '/' + word.strip()` impacts the variable `str` by appending the stripped version of `word` (with leading and trailing whitespace removed) to `str` followed by a '/'. The original value of `str` is an empty string (`""`), `word` is the first substring in `array` and is not an empty string, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `str` starts as an empty string (`""`) and `word` is the first substring in `array` and not empty, the updated value of `str` will be `'/'` concatenated with `word.strip()`. Since `word` is the first element of `array` and is not an empty string, let's denote the first element of `array` as `first_word`. Therefore, `word.strip()` is equivalent to `first_word.strip()` which is just `first_word` because there is no leading or trailing whitespace mentioned as being removed (or it was already removed in the initial state).

Thus, the updated value of `str` is `'/' + first_word`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`line` is a non-empty string starting with at least one '/', `array` is a list of substrings from `line` split by '/', `str` is '/' + first_word, `word` is the first substring in `array`, and the current value of `word` is not an empty string.**
