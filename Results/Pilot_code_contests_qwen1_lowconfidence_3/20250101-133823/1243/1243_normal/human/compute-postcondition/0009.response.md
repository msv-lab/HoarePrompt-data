Postcondition: ***`line` is a non-empty string starting with at least one '/', `array` is a list of substrings from `line` split by '/', `str` is '/' + (stripped `word`), and `array` must have at least one more element. Since the if condition `word != ''` is met, `str` is updated to '/' + (stripped `word`). If `word` is an empty string, the else part does not execute, so `str` remains unchanged.***
