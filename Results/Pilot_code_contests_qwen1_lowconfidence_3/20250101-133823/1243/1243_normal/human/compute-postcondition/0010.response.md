Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `line` is a non-empty string starting with at least one '/'.
   - `array` is a list of substrings from `line` split by '/'.
   - `str` is set to '/' + (stripped `word`).
   - `array` must have at least one more element.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each `word` in `array`.
   - The condition `if word != '':` checks if the current `word` is non-empty.
   - If `word` is non-empty, `str` is updated to '/' + (stripped `word`).
   - If `word` is empty, `str` remains unchanged.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `array` must have at least one more element left to process.
   - This means that the current `word` being processed should be the next element in `array`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `array` must have at least one more element left.
- The current `word` being processed should be the next element in `array`.
- Since `word` is non-empty (as the loop continued), `str` is updated to '/' + (stripped `word`).

Thus, the new state for the next iteration would be:

State: **`line` is a non-empty string starting with at least one '/', `array` is a list of substrings from `line` split by '/' with at least one more element, `str` is '/' + (stripped `word`), and `word` is the next element in `array`**. 

To be more precise, we can represent it as:

State: **`line` is a non-empty string starting with at least one '/', `array` is a list of substrings from `line` split by '/' with at least one more element, `str` is '/' + (stripped `word`), and `word` is the next element in `array`**.
