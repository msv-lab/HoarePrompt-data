The code `line = stdin.readline()` reads a line from standard input and assigns it to the variable `line`. Since the input string is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the '/' character, starting with at least one '/' and the length not exceeding 100 characters, the variable `line` will hold this input string.

Output State: **`line` is the input string, which is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the '/' character, starting with at least one '/' and the length not exceeding 100 characters.**
