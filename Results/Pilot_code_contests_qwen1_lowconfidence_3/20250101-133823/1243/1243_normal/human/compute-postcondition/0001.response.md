The code splits the input string `line` using the '/' character as the delimiter and assigns the resulting list to the variable `array`. Since `line` is a non-empty string starting with at least one '/' and containing lowercase Latin letters and '/', the resulting list `array` will contain the substrings from `line`, split by '/'. The original string `line` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`line` is the input string, which is a non-empty string starting with at least one '/' and consisting of lowercase Latin letters and '/', `array` is a list of substrings from `line` split by '/'**
