Functionality: **The function reads a single line from standard input, which is expected to be a non-empty string representing a directory path consisting of lowercase Latin letters and '/' characters. It splits the input string by '/' and concatenates the non-empty parts with a '/' separator, trimming any leading or trailing whitespace. Finally, it writes the resulting string to standard output. Potential edge cases include empty strings or input strings without any '/'. The function does not return any value.**
