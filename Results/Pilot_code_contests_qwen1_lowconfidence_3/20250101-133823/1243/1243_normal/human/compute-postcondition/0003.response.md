State: **`line` is a non-empty string starting with at least one '/', `array` is a list of substrings from `line` split by '/', `str` is an empty string, `word` is the first substring in `array`**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the For Loop**:
   - The for loop iterates over each element in the list `array`.
   - Each iteration, `word` will represent the current substring being processed.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `line` is given as a non-empty string starting with at least one '/' and consisting of lowercase Latin letters and '/'.
   - `array` is the list of substrings obtained by splitting `line` using '/' as the delimiter.
   - `str` is an empty string (though it is not used in the loop itself, it's part of the initial state).

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `array` must contain at least one element.
   - The first iteration of the loop sets `word` to the first element of `array`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `array` is derived from `line`, `array` must have at least one element to allow the loop to execute.
   - The first element of `array` will be assigned to `word` during the first iteration of the loop.

Thus, the required adjustments for the loop to execute are:
- `array` must have at least one element.
- `word` should be set to the first element of `array` before the loop starts.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`line` is a non-empty string starting with at least one '/', `array` is a list of substrings from `line` split by '/', `str` is an empty string, `word` is the first substring in `array`**
