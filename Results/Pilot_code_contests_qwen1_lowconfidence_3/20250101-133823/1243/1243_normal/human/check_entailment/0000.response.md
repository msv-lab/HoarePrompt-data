Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly normalizes the given path by removing unnecessary '/' characters while ensuring that a single '/' remains at the end if the path represents the root directory. The logic of splitting the input string by '/' and filtering out empty strings ensures that redundant '/' characters are removed. The `strip()` method further ensures that multiple consecutive '/' characters are reduced to a single one. Given the constraints and examples provided, the program works as expected for all potential cases.
