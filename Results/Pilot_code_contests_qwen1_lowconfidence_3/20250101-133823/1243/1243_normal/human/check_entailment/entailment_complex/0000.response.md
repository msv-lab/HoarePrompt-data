Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to normalize a given path according to the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a single line from standard input, which is expected to be a non-empty string representing a directory path consisting of lowercase Latin letters and '/' characters. This matches the requirement that the input is a non-empty string starting with at least one '/' and containing no more than 100 characters.

2. **Splitting the Path**: The input string is split by '/' using `split('/')`. This correctly separates the different components of the path.

3. **Removing Empty Components**: The program iterates over the split components, ensuring that only non-empty components are considered. This removes any unnecessary '/' characters from the middle of the path, thereby normalizing it.

4. **Trimming Whitespace**: Each non-empty component is trimmed using `strip()`, ensuring that there is no leading or trailing whitespace, which aligns with the requirement to remove unnecessary characters.

5. **Reconstructing the Normalized Path**: The program reconstructs the path by concatenating the non-empty, stripped components with a single '/' as a separator, ensuring that the final output has the smallest possible number of '/' characters.

6. **Output**: The normalized path is written to standard output, matching the problem description's requirement to produce the path in normalized form.

Given these points, the program correctly transforms any given path into its normalized form by removing unnecessary '/' characters while preserving the root directory indicator. Therefore, the program is correct and always meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
