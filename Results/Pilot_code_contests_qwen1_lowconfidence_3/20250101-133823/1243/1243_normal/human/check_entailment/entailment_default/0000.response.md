Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly transforms the given path into its normalized form by removing unnecessary slashes while ensuring that a single slash remains at the end if the path is to the root directory. The code handles the splitting of the input string by '/' and concatenates the non-empty parts with a '/' separator, which aligns with the problem description. The code also handles potential edge cases such as empty strings or input strings without any '/' correctly. Therefore, the code works as expected for every potential case.
