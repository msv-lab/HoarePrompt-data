#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive odd integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 199.
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
    #The program returns the value of math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n)) where n is a positive odd integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 199
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which must be a positive odd integer within the range 3 ≤ n ≤ 199. It calculates and returns the value of `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. There are no additional actions or side effects beyond this calculation. The function ensures that `n` is within the specified range, although the code itself does not explicitly check for even numbers; therefore, if an even number is passed, the result might still be computed but it would violate the precondition.
