Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which must be a positive odd integer within the range 3 ≤ n ≤ 199. It calculates and returns the value of `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. There are no additional actions or side effects beyond this calculation. The function ensures that `n` is within the specified range, although the code itself does not explicitly check for even numbers; therefore, if an even number is passed, the result might still be computed but it would violate the precondition.**

This summary captures the essential behavior of the function, including the required input constraints and the calculation performed, while also noting the potential issue with even values of `n`.
