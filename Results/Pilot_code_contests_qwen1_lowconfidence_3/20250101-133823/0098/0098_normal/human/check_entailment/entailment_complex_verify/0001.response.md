Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum side length of the square required to embed a 2n-gon for odd values of \( n \). The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` uses a formula derived for even \( n \), which is incorrect for odd \( n \). Specifically, the formula \( \frac{\cos(\pi / (4n))}{\sin(\pi / (2n))} \) is not valid for odd \( n \). Therefore, the program will produce incorrect results for the given problem description, making it incorrect.
