You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The statement of this problem is the same as the statement of problem C1. The only difference is that, in problem C1, n is always even, and in C2, n is always odd.

You are given a regular polygon with 2 ⋅ n vertices (it's convex and has equal sides and equal angles) and all its sides have length 1. Let's name it as 2n-gon.

Your task is to find the square of the minimum size such that you can embed 2n-gon in the square. Embedding 2n-gon in the square means that you need to place 2n-gon in the square in such way that each point which lies inside or on a border of 2n-gon should also lie inside or on a border of the square.

You can rotate 2n-gon and/or the square.

Input

The first line contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 200) — the number of test cases.

Next T lines contain descriptions of test cases — one per line. Each line contains single odd integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 199). Don't forget you need to embed 2n-gon, not an n-gon.

Output

Print T real numbers — one per test case. For each test case, print the minimum length of a side of the square 2n-gon can be embedded in. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10^{-6}.

Example

Input

Output


1.931851653
3.196226611
126.687663595
Program:
```
import math

for ca in xrange(int(raw_input())):
    n = int(raw_input())
    print('%.9f' % func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which must be a positive odd integer within the range 3 ≤ n ≤ 199. It calculates and returns the value of `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. There are no additional actions or side effects beyond this calculation. The function ensures that `n` is within the specified range, although the code itself does not explicitly check for even numbers; therefore, if an even number is passed, the result might still be computed but it would violate the precondition.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
