Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. The formula used in `func_1` is derived under the assumption that `n` is even, which contradicts the problem statement where `n` is always odd. Specifically, the formula `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))` is not valid for odd values of `n`.

For example, consider the case when `n = 3`. The correct approach for finding the minimum side length of the square that can embed a 6-gon (2n-gon with n=3) involves different geometric considerations than the given formula. The correct solution for a 6-gon (hexagon) inscribed in a square would involve a different trigonometric relationship.

To verify this, let's consider the correct geometric solution for a hexagon. The distance from the center of the hexagon to a vertex (the circumradius) is equal to the side length of the hexagon, which is 1. The height of the hexagon is \(2 \times \text{circumradius} \times \sin(\pi/6) = 2 \times 1 \times \frac{1}{2} = 1\). The width of the hexagon (distance between two opposite vertices) is \(2 \times \text{circumradius} \times \cos(\pi/6) = 2 \times 1 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3}\).

The minimum side length of the square that can contain the hexagon is the maximum of the height and width, which is \(\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732\). However, the given code computes a different value, showing that the formula is incorrect for odd `n`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
