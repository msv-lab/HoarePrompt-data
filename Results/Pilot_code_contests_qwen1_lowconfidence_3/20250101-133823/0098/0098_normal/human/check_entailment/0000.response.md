Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to calculate the square's side length required to embed a 2n-gon. However, the formula used in `func_1` might not be correct for all odd values of \( n \).

To verify this, let's consider a few test cases:

1. **Test Case: \( n = 3 \)**
   - A 2n-gon with \( n = 3 \) is a hexagon.
   - The minimum side length of the square that can embed a hexagon can be derived from geometric properties. The distance between opposite vertices of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle is twice the radius of the circle. For a unit-sided hexagon, the radius of the circumscribed circle is \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\), so the side length of the square is \( \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} \approx 1.1547 \).
   - The given program computes \( \text{cos}(\pi / (4 \cdot 3)) / \sin(\pi / (2 \cdot 3)) \), which evaluates to approximately 1.931851653. This value does not match the expected side length of the square, indicating a potential issue with the formula.

2. **Test Case: \( n = 5 \)**
   - A 2n-gon with \( n = 5 \) is a decagon.
   - Similar to the hexagon, the minimum side length of the square can be derived from the geometry of a decagon. The side length of the square that can embed a decagon is more complex but should be less than 3.196226611, the value computed by the program.
   
Given these observations, the program does not seem to correctly compute the side length of the square for all odd values of \( n \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
