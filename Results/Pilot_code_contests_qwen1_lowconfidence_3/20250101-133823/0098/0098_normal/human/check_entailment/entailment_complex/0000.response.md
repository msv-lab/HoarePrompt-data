Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The problem description states that the input consists of a single integer \( T \) (the number of test cases), followed by \( T \) lines, each containing a single odd integer \( n \) (where \( 3 \leq n \leq 199 \)). However, the provided program reads the first integer as the number of test cases but does not correctly process multiple test cases. It expects a single \( n \) for each test case and prints the result without further input.

2. **Function Calculation**: The function `func_1(n)` calculates \( \frac{\cos(\pi / (4 * n))}{\sin(\pi / (2 * n))} \). While this formula is mathematically correct for finding the side length of the smallest square that can contain a 2n-gon, it is not immediately clear from the problem description why this specific formula is used. The problem description does not mention any trigonometric formulas or specify how the side length of the square is derived. Therefore, the program may be correct for this particular formula, but it is unclear if this formula is the only correct approach according to the problem statement.

3. **Output Format**: The problem requires printing the minimum length of a side of the square to 9 decimal places using the format `%.9f`. The program does this correctly, but it is important to note that the correctness of the formula used in `func_1(n)` is crucial here. If the formula is incorrect, the output will be wrong despite the correct formatting.

To meet the problem description, the program needs to:
- Read \( T \) test cases.
- For each test case, read an odd integer \( n \).
- Compute the side length of the square using the correct formula (if the provided formula is indeed correct).
- Print the result for each test case with the required precision.

Since the current implementation does not handle multiple test cases and does not fully align with the problem description in terms of input processing and handling, the program is **False**.
