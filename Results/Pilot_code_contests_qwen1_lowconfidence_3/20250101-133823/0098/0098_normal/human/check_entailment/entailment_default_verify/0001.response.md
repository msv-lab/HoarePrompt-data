Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program uses the formula `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))` to calculate the minimum side length of the square that can enclose a 2n-gon. This formula is derived for even \( n \) and does not hold for odd \( n \). Since the problem description specifies that \( n \) is always odd, the formula is incorrect for this scenario. The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` does not handle odd \( n \) correctly, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and is thus incorrect.
