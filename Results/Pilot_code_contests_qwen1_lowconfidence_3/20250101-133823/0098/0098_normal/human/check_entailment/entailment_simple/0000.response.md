Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. According to the problem description, the goal is to find the minimum side length of a square that can embed a \(2n\)-gon (a regular polygon with \(2n\) vertices), where \(n\) is an odd integer between 3 and 199. However, the function `func_1` implemented in the program does not calculate the required side length of the square.

#### Analysis:
- The formula used in the function `func_1(n)` is:
  \[
  \text{result} = \frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}
  \]

- This formula does not directly relate to the problem of finding the minimum side length of the square that can embed the \(2n\)-gon.

- The correct approach involves using geometric properties of the \(2n\)-gon and the square. Specifically, the maximum distance from the center of the \(2n\)-gon to any vertex (the circumradius) and the orientation of the polygon need to be considered.

- A more appropriate method would involve calculating the circumradius of the \(2n\)-gon and then determining the side length of the square based on the geometry of the \(2n\)-gon. For example, the side length of the square should be at least twice the circumradius of the \(2n\)-gon.

Given these points, the current implementation does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
