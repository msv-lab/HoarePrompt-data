Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum side length of the square required to embed a 2n-gon when \( n \) is odd. The provided formula in `func_1` is derived for even \( n \) and does not apply to odd \( n \). The annotation correctly states that \( n \) is a positive odd integer, and the function call uses this property. However, the formula used in the function is incorrect for odd \( n \), as evidenced by the example provided in the problem statement and the annotated version. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
