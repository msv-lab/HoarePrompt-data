Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. According to the problem description, the input `n` should always be odd, and the task is to find the square of the minimum size that can embed a \(2n\)-gon. However, the provided code does not validate whether `n` is odd or not. If an even number is provided, the code will still compute the value using the formula, which violates the precondition of the problem.

To ensure the code works correctly for every potential case, we need to add a validation step to check if `n` is odd. Here is an updated version of the code with the necessary validation:

```python
import math

for ca in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    if n % 2 == 0:
        print("Incorrect input: n must be odd")
        continue
    print('%.9f' % func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
```

This version checks if `n` is odd and prints an error message if it is not, ensuring that the input adheres to the problem constraints. Without this check, the program is incorrect as it fails to meet the requirements for all potential cases.
