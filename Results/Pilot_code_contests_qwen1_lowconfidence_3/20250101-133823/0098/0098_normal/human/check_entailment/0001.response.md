Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum side length of the square required to embed a 2n-gon. The formula used in `func_1` is incorrect for odd values of \( n \). The formula should take into account the properties of a regular polygon with an even number of sides when calculating the minimum enclosing square.

For odd \( n \), the correct approach involves different geometric considerations. The given formula is derived for even \( n \) and does not apply directly to odd \( n \).

To illustrate, let's consider the case when \( n = 3 \) (a regular hexagon). The correct minimum side length of the square that can enclose a regular hexagon with side length 1 is approximately 1.931851653, but the program outputs a value that does not match this.

Hereâ€™s a corrected approach for odd \( n \):

1. For a regular polygon with \( 2n \) vertices, the minimum side length of the enclosing square can be derived from trigonometric properties specific to odd \( n \).
2. A more accurate approach would involve using the circumradius of the polygon and trigonometric functions to derive the correct side length.

Since the provided program does not handle the case for odd \( n \) correctly, it fails for at least one potential case, making the program incorrect.
