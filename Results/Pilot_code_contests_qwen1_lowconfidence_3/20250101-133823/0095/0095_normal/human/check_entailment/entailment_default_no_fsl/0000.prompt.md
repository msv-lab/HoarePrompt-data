You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You're given an array a_1, …, a_n of n non-negative integers.

Let's call it sharpened if and only if there exists an integer 1 ≤ k ≤ n such that a_1 < a_2 < … < a_k and a_k > a_{k+1} > … > a_n. In particular, any strictly increasing or strictly decreasing array is sharpened. For example:

  * The arrays [4], [0, 1], [12, 10, 8] and [3, 11, 15, 9, 7, 4] are sharpened; 
  * The arrays [2, 8, 2, 8, 6, 5], [0, 1, 1, 0] and [2, 5, 6, 9, 8, 8] are not sharpened. 



You can do the following operation as many times as you want: choose any strictly positive element of the array, and decrease it by one. Formally, you can choose any i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) such that a_i>0 and assign a_i := a_i - 1.

Tell if it's possible to make the given array sharpened using some number (possibly zero) of these operations.

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 15\ 000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).

The second line of each test case contains a sequence of n non-negative integers a_1, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing "Yes" (without quotes) if it's possible to make the given array sharpened using the described operations, or "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

Note

In the first and the second test case of the first test, the given array is already sharpened.

In the third test case of the first test, we can transform the array into [3, 11, 15, 9, 7, 4] (decrease the first element 97 times and decrease the last element 4 times). It is sharpened because 3 < 11 < 15 and 15 > 9 > 7 > 4.

In the fourth test case of the first test, it's impossible to make the given array sharpened.
Functions with output description for each function:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if func_1(l) or func_2(l):
        print('Yes')
        continue
    ind = -1
    mini = 19 ** 10
    maxi = 0
    pr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        mini = min(mini, l[i])
        maxi = max(maxi, l[i])
        if l[i] < pr:
            ind = i
            break
        pr += 1
    f = 1
    if ind == -1:
        print('Yes')
        continue
    mini = l[ind - 1]
    for i in range(ind, n):
        l[i] = min(l[i], mini - 1)
        mini = min(mini, l[i])
        if l[i] < 0 or mini < 0:
            f = 0
    print('Yes' if f else 'No')

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all((l[i] > l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)))
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a list `curr` of non-negative integers where the length of `curr` is between 1 and \(3 \times 10^5\), inclusive, and each element in `curr` is in the range \([0, 10^9]\). It checks whether all elements in `curr` are in strictly increasing order. If all elements satisfy this condition, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include empty lists (which would return `True` since there are no elements to violate the strictly increasing order) and lists with duplicate elements (which would also return `False`). The function does not handle or modify the input list in any way other than checking its elements.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all((l[i] < l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a list `curr` of non-negative integers and returns `True` if the elements in the list are strictly decreasing. If any element is not less than its previous element, it returns `False`. The function does not handle the case where the list contains fewer than two elements, in which case it should return `False` since there cannot be a valid sequence of strictly decreasing elements.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
