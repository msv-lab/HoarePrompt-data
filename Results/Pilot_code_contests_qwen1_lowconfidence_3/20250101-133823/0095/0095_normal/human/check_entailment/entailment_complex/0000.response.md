Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which check if a list is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, respectively. However, these functions do not accurately reflect the problem description. The problem description defines a sharpened array as one where there exists a pivot index `k` such that the subarray from `a_1` to `a_k` is strictly increasing and the subarray from `a_k` to `a_n` is strictly decreasing. The provided code only checks for strictly increasing or strictly decreasing sequences without considering the existence of a pivot index `k`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:
- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`
- According to the problem description, this array is sharpened because `1 < 2 < 3` and `3 > 2 > 1`.
- However, the current implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` would not identify this array as sharpened, as neither `func_1` nor `func_2` considers the possibility of a pivot index `k`.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case and hence is incorrect.
