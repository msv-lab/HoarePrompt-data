You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You're given an array a_1, …, a_n of n non-negative integers.

Let's call it sharpened if and only if there exists an integer 1 ≤ k ≤ n such that a_1 < a_2 < … < a_k and a_k > a_{k+1} > … > a_n. In particular, any strictly increasing or strictly decreasing array is sharpened. For example:

  * The arrays [4], [0, 1], [12, 10, 8] and [3, 11, 15, 9, 7, 4] are sharpened; 
  * The arrays [2, 8, 2, 8, 6, 5], [0, 1, 1, 0] and [2, 5, 6, 9, 8, 8] are not sharpened. 



You can do the following operation as many times as you want: choose any strictly positive element of the array, and decrease it by one. Formally, you can choose any i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) such that a_i>0 and assign a_i := a_i - 1.

Tell if it's possible to make the given array sharpened using some number (possibly zero) of these operations.

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 15\ 000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).

The second line of each test case contains a sequence of n non-negative integers a_1, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing "Yes" (without quotes) if it's possible to make the given array sharpened using the described operations, or "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

Note

In the first and the second test case of the first test, the given array is already sharpened.

In the third test case of the first test, we can transform the array into [3, 11, 15, 9, 7, 4] (decrease the first element 97 times and decrease the last element 4 times). It is sharpened because 3 < 11 < 15 and 15 > 9 > 7 > 4.

In the fourth test case of the first test, it's impossible to make the given array sharpened.
Program:
```
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all((l[i] > l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)))

#Function 2:
def func_2(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all((l[i] < l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
