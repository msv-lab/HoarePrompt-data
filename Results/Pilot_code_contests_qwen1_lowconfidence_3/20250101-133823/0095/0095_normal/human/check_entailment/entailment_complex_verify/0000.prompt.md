You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You're given an array a_1, …, a_n of n non-negative integers.

Let's call it sharpened if and only if there exists an integer 1 ≤ k ≤ n such that a_1 < a_2 < … < a_k and a_k > a_{k+1} > … > a_n. In particular, any strictly increasing or strictly decreasing array is sharpened. For example:

  * The arrays [4], [0, 1], [12, 10, 8] and [3, 11, 15, 9, 7, 4] are sharpened; 
  * The arrays [2, 8, 2, 8, 6, 5], [0, 1, 1, 0] and [2, 5, 6, 9, 8, 8] are not sharpened. 



You can do the following operation as many times as you want: choose any strictly positive element of the array, and decrease it by one. Formally, you can choose any i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) such that a_i>0 and assign a_i := a_i - 1.

Tell if it's possible to make the given array sharpened using some number (possibly zero) of these operations.

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 15\ 000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).

The second line of each test case contains a sequence of n non-negative integers a_1, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing "Yes" (without quotes) if it's possible to make the given array sharpened using the described operations, or "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

Note

In the first and the second test case of the first test, the given array is already sharpened.

In the third test case of the first test, we can transform the array into [3, 11, 15, 9, 7, 4] (decrease the first element 97 times and decrease the last element 4 times). It is sharpened because 3 < 11 < 15 and 15 > 9 > 7 > 4.

In the fourth test case of the first test, it's impossible to make the given array sharpened.
Program:
```
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all((l[i] > l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)))

#Function 2:
def func_2(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all((l[i] < l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to solving the problem. The problem requires determining if it is possible to make the given array sharpened using the described operations, but the functions are checking if the array is already strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, which is not the correct approach.

To solve this problem, you would need to implement a different logic that checks if it is possible to make the array sharpened by performing the allowed operations. The current implementation does not address the problem description correctly and thus fails to meet the requirements for any input.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if func_1(l) or func_2(l):
        print('Yes')
        continue
    ind = -1
    mini = 19 ** 10
    maxi = 0
    pr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        mini = min(mini, l[i])
        maxi = max(maxi, l[i])
        if l[i] < pr:
            ind = i
            break
        pr += 1
    f = 1
    if ind == -1:
        print('Yes')
        continue
    mini = l[ind - 1]
    for i in range(ind, n):
        l[i] = min(l[i], mini - 1)
        mini = min(mini, l[i])
        if l[i] < 0 or mini < 0:
            f = 0
    print('Yes' if f else 'No')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: curr is a list of non-negative integers such that 1 <= len(curr) <= 3 * 10^5 and each element in curr is in the range [0, 10^9].
def func_1(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all(l[i] > l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n))
    #The program returns True if all elements in `curr` are in strictly increasing order, otherwise returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `curr` of non-negative integers where the length of `curr` is between 1 and \(3 \times 10^5\), inclusive, and each element in `curr` is in the range \([0, 10^9]\). It checks whether all elements in `curr` are in strictly increasing order. If all elements satisfy this condition, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include empty lists (which would return `True` since there are no elements to violate the strictly increasing order) and lists with duplicate elements (which would also return `False`). The function does not handle or modify the input list in any way other than checking its elements.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: curr is a list of non-negative integers representing the array, and len(curr) >= 1.
def func_2(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all(l[i] < l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n))
    #The program returns True if all elements in the list `curr` satisfy that each element is less than the previous one, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `curr` of non-negative integers and returns `True` if the elements in the list are strictly decreasing. If any element is not less than its previous element, it returns `False`. The function does not handle the case where the list contains fewer than two elements, in which case it should return `False` since there cannot be a valid sequence of strictly decreasing elements.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
