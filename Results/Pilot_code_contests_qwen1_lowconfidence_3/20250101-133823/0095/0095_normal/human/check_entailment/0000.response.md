Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to solving the problem. The problem requires determining if it is possible to make the given array sharpened using the described operations, but the functions are checking if the array is already strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, which is not the correct approach.

To solve this problem, you would need to implement a different logic that checks if it is possible to make the array sharpened by performing the allowed operations. The current implementation does not address the problem description correctly and thus fails to meet the requirements for any input.
