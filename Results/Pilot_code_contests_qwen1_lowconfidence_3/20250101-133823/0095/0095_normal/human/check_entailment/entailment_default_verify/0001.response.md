Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the logic required to determine if an array can be made sharpened. Specifically, `func_1` checks if the array is strictly increasing and `func_2` checks if the array is strictly decreasing, but neither function considers the requirement that there must exist at least one peak followed by a decrease. The output hints for `func_2` confirm this, indicating that it only checks for strict decreasing order without considering the peak requirement. Therefore, the program cannot correctly determine if an array can be made sharpened, as it lacks the necessary logic to identify and validate the presence of a peak and subsequent decrease.
