Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the problem requirements. These functions check if the array is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, which is not the same as determining if it is possible to make the array sharpened using the allowed operations. The functions do not consider the possibility of making the array sharpened by decreasing elements. Additionally, the output hints clarify that `func_2` does not handle the case where the list contains fewer than two elements, which further confirms that the current implementation is incomplete and incorrect for the given problem.
