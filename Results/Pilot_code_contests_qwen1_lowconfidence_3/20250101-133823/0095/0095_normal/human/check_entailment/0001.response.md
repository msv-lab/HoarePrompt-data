Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the logic required to determine if an array can be made sharpened. These functions check if an array is strictly increasing (`func_1`) or strictly decreasing (`func_2`), but they do not consider the requirement that there must exist at least one peak (`a_k`) followed by a decrease. 

To verify this, consider the following example:
- Input: `[100, 11, 15, 9, 7, 4]`
- Expected Output: **Yes** (as mentioned in the example output)
- Program Output: **No** (since neither `func_1` nor `func_2` alone can determine if the array can be transformed into a sharpened array)

The program fails to check if the array can be modified to form a sharpened array, which requires identifying a potential peak and ensuring the rest of the array decreases from that point. Therefore, the provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as described.
