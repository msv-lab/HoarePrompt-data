The function `func_2` accepts a list `curr` of non-negative integers and returns `True` if the elements in the list are strictly decreasing. If any element is not less than its previous element, it returns `False`. The function does not handle the case where the list contains fewer than two elements, in which case it should return `False` since there cannot be a valid sequence of strictly decreasing elements.
