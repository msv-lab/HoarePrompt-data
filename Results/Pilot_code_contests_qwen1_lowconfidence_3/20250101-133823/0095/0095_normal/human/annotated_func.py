#State of the program right berfore the function call: curr is a list of non-negative integers such that 1 <= len(curr) <= 3 * 10^5 and each element in curr is in the range [0, 10^9].
def func_1(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all(l[i] > l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n))
    #The program returns True if all elements in `curr` are in strictly increasing order, otherwise returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `curr` of non-negative integers where the length of `curr` is between 1 and \(3 \times 10^5\), inclusive, and each element in `curr` is in the range \([0, 10^9]\). It checks whether all elements in `curr` are in strictly increasing order. If all elements satisfy this condition, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include empty lists (which would return `True` since there are no elements to violate the strictly increasing order) and lists with duplicate elements (which would also return `False`). The function does not handle or modify the input list in any way other than checking its elements.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: curr is a list of non-negative integers representing the array, and len(curr) >= 1.
def func_2(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all(l[i] < l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n))
    #The program returns True if all elements in the list `curr` satisfy that each element is less than the previous one, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `curr` of non-negative integers and returns `True` if the elements in the list are strictly decreasing. If any element is not less than its previous element, it returns `False`. The function does not handle the case where the list contains fewer than two elements, in which case it should return `False` since there cannot be a valid sequence of strictly decreasing elements.
