`n` is assigned the value of `len(curr)`, which calculates the length of the list `curr`. The length of `curr` is a non-negative integer since `curr` is a list of non-negative integers and its length is at least 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `curr` is a list of non-negative integers representing the array, and len(curr) >= 1; `n` is the length of `curr`.

Output State: **`curr` is a list of non-negative integers representing the array, and len(curr) >= 1; `n` is the length of `curr`**
