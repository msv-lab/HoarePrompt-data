The function `func_1` accepts a list `curr` of non-negative integers where the length of `curr` is between 1 and \(3 \times 10^5\), inclusive, and each element in `curr` is in the range \([0, 10^9]\). It checks whether all elements in `curr` are in strictly increasing order. If all elements satisfy this condition, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include empty lists (which would return `True` since there are no elements to violate the strictly increasing order) and lists with duplicate elements (which would also return `False`). The function does not handle or modify the input list in any way other than checking its elements.
