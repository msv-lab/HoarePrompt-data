n and m are positive integers such that 1 â‰¤ n, m â‰¤ 12. The first line contains n pairs of integers, and the second line contains m pairs of integers, where each pair consists of two different numbers between 1 and 9. No pair contains the same number twice, and all pairs within each set are distinct. It is guaranteed that there is at least one number that is present in both sets of pairs.
