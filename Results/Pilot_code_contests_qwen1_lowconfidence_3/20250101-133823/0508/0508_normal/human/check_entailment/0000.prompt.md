You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two participants are each given a pair of distinct numbers from 1 to 9 such that there's exactly one number that is present in both pairs. They want to figure out the number that matches by using a communication channel you have access to without revealing it to you.

Both participants communicated to each other a set of pairs of numbers, that includes the pair given to them. Each pair in the communicated sets comprises two different numbers.

Determine if you can with certainty deduce the common number, or if you can determine with certainty that both participants know the number but you do not.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 12) — the number of pairs the first participant communicated to the second and vice versa.

The second line contains n pairs of integers, each between 1 and 9, — pairs of numbers communicated from first participant to the second.

The third line contains m pairs of integers, each between 1 and 9, — pairs of numbers communicated from the second participant to the first.

All pairs within each set are distinct (in particular, if there is a pair (1,2), there will be no pair (2,1) within the same set), and no pair contains the same number twice.

It is guaranteed that the two sets do not contradict the statements, in other words, there is pair from the first set and a pair from the second set that share exactly one number.

Output

If you can deduce the shared number with certainty, print that number.

If you can with certainty deduce that both participants know the shared number, but you do not know it, print 0.

Otherwise print -1.

Examples

Input

2 2
1 2 3 4
1 5 3 4


Output

1


Input

2 2
1 2 3 4
1 5 6 4


Output

0


Input

2 3
1 2 4 5
1 2 1 3 2 3


Output

-1

Note

In the first example the first participant communicated pairs (1,2) and (3,4), and the second communicated (1,5), (3,4). Since we know that the actual pairs they received share exactly one number, it can't be that they both have (3,4). Thus, the first participant has (1,2) and the second has (1,5), and at this point you already know the shared number is 1.

In the second example either the first participant has (1,2) and the second has (1,5), or the first has (3,4) and the second has (6,4). In the first case both of them know the shared number is 1, in the second case both of them know the shared number is 4. You don't have enough information to tell 1 and 4 apart.

In the third case if the first participant was given (1,2), they don't know what the shared number is, since from their perspective the second participant might have been given either (1,3), in which case the shared number is 1, or (2,3), in which case the shared number is 2. While the second participant does know the number with certainty, neither you nor the first participant do, so the output is -1.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    p1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    p2 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    cand = set()
    cc = [set() for i in range(n)]
    dd = [set() for i in range(m)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            (a, b) = (p1[2 * i], p1[2 * i + 1])
            (c, d) = (p2[2 * j], p2[2 * j + 1])
            if a not in (c, d) and b not in (c, d):
                continue
            if a in (c, d) and b in (c, d):
                continue
            if a in (c, d):
                kandidat = a
            else:
                kandidat = b
            cand.add(kandidat)
            cc[i].add(kandidat)
            dd[j].add(kandidat)
    if len(cand) == 1:
        print(cand.pop())
    elif max((len(cc[i]) for i in range(n))) <= 1 and max((len(dd[i]) for i in range(m))) <= 1:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(-1)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
