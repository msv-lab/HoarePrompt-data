Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly those involving ambiguity. The output hints confirm that the program only partially addresses the problem requirements. It fails to correctly identify scenarios where the shared number cannot be determined uniquely, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases. For instance, in the third example provided:

**Input:**
```
2 3
1 2 4 5
1 2 1 3 2 3
```

The expected output is `-1` because there is ambiguity about the shared number, but the program incorrectly outputs `1`.

The program needs to more rigorously check for all possible shared numbers and ensure that it correctly identifies cases where the shared number cannot be determined uniquely. The current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
