Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Input Parsing**: The code reads input using `raw_input`, which is not available in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead.

2. **Set Processing Logic**: The code attempts to identify a candidate shared number by checking pairs from both sets. However, the logic for identifying candidates is flawed. Specifically, the code does not correctly ensure that the identified candidate is the only number shared uniquely between the two sets.

3. **Candidate Identification**: The code adds candidates to a set `cand` without properly ensuring that the identified candidates are unique across both sets. For example, if multiple pairs share the same number, the code incorrectly considers this number as a candidate.

4. **Output Logic**: The code's logic for determining the output (whether to print the candidate, 0, or -1) is not correctly implemented. The current logic might fail to correctly identify the shared number or might incorrectly conclude that no unique number is shared when one actually is.

Here is an example that demonstrates why the code fails:

Consider the following inputs:
```
2 2
1 2 3 4
1 5 3 4
```

- The first participant sends pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4).
- The second participant sends pairs (1, 5) and (3, 4).

The code would process these pairs and incorrectly conclude that the shared number could be either 1 or 3, leading to an incorrect output. 

To correctly solve the problem, you need to ensure that the code identifies the unique shared number if it exists and handles cases where no unique number is shared appropriately.
