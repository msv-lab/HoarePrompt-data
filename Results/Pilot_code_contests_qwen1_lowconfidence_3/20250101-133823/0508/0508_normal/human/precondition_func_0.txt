n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 12. The input consists of three lines: the first line contains n pairs of integers representing pairs communicated from the first participant to the second, the second line contains m pairs of integers representing pairs communicated from the second participant to the first. All pairs within each set are distinct and contain two different numbers between 1 and 9. It is guaranteed that there is at least one pair from the first set and one pair from the second set that share exactly one number.
