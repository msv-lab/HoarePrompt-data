Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[0]`, `d` is `p2[1]`, and if both `a` is in `(c, d)` and `b` is in `(c, d)`, no changes are made to `j` and `m`. Since no changes occur in the if condition, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
