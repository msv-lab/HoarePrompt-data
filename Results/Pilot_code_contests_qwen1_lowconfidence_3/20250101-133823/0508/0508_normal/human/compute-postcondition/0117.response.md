The `continue` statement in the given code simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is within the range `(c, d)`, `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`, and `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`.**
