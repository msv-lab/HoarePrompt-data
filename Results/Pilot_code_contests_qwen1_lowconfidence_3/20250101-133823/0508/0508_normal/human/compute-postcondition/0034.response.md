The code `cand.add(kandidat)` adds the value of `kandidat` to the set `cand`. The value of `kandidat` depends on whether `a` is in the tuple `(c, d)` or not. Since `c` is `p2[2 * j]` and `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, we need to consider the condition under which `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`.

- If `a` is in the tuple `(c, d)`, then `kandidat` is `a`.
- Otherwise, `kandidat` is `b`.

Since `cand` is initially a set containing either `a` or `b`, adding `kandidat` to `cand` will not change the fact that `cand` already contains one of `a` or `b`. Therefore, the set `cand` will contain both `a` and `b` after the addition.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than `j+1`, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing both `a` and `b`, `cc[0]` contains `a` (or `b`), `dd[j+1]` is a set that remains unchanged, and `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)` or not.
