The code assigns the value of `a` to `kandidat`. Given the initial conditions, `a` is in the range `(c, d)`, which means `kandidat` will also be in the same range. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `a` is in `(c, d)`; `kandidat` is `a`**
