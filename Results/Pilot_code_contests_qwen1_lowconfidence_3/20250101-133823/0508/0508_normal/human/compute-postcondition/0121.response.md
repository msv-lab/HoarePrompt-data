The code sets `kandidat` to the value of `a`. Since `a` is defined as `p1[2 * i]`, the value of `kandidat` is now `p1[2 * i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is `p1[2 * i]`, `cc[i]` contains `p1[2 * i]`, and `dd[0]` contains `p1[2 * i]`.**
