The code `kandidat = b` updates the value of `kandidat` to `b`. This change affects the following variables:

- `cand` which contains `{kandidat}` will now contain `{b}`.
- `cc[i]` which contains `kandidat` will now contain `b`.
- `dd[prev_j + 1]` and `dd[prev_j + 2]` which contain `kandidat` will now contain `b`.

The conditions of the variables remain unchanged if `b` is in `(c, d)`. If `b` is not in `(c, d)`, the conditions remain unchanged. Since the initial conditions are not specified to change, we assume they remain the same.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is `b`; `cand` contains `{b}`; `cc[i]` contains `b`; `dd[prev_j + 1]` contains `b`; `dd[prev_j + 2]` contains `b`. If `b` is in `(c, d)` and `a` is in `(c, d)`, the conditions of the variables remain unchanged. If either `b` or `a` is not in `(c, d)`, the conditions of the variables remain unchanged.**
