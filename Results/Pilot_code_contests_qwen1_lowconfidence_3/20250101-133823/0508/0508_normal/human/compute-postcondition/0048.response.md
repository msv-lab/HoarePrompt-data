The code adds `kandidat` to `cc[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 0,
- `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)` or not.

Since `i` is 0, `cc[i]` is the same as `cc[0]`, which initially contains both `a` and `b`.

Adding `kandidat` (which is either `a` or `b`) to `cc[0]` does not change the fact that `cc[0]` already contains both `a` and `b`. Therefore, `cc[0]` still contains both `a` and `b`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than `j + 2`, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing both `a` and `b` and `kandidat`, `cc[0]` now contains both `a` and `b`, `dd[j + 1]` is a set containing either `a` or `b`, `dd[j + 2]` is a set that remains unchanged, and `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)` or not.**
