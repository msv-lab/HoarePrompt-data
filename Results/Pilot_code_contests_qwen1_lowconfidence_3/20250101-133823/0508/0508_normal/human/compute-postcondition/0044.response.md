The code sets `kandidat` to the value of `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than `j + 2`, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing both `a` and `b`, `cc[0]` now contains both `a` and `b`, `dd[j + 1]` is a set containing either `a` or `b`, `dd[j + 2]` is a set that remains unchanged, `kandidat` is `a`, and `continue` does not affect any variables and the if condition evaluates to true, so the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
