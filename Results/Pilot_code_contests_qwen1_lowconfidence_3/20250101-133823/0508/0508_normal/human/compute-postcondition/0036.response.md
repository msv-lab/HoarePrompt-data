`dd[j]` is a set that adds `kandidat`. Since `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)`, the set `dd[j]` will contain one of `a` or `b`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than `j+1`, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing both `a` and `b`, `cc[0]` now contains both `a` and `b`, `dd[j]` is a set containing either `a` or `b`, `dd[j+1]` is a set that remains unchanged, and `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)` or not.**
