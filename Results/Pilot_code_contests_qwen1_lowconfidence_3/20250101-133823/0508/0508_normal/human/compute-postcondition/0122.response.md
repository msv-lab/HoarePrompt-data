The initial state is defined as follows:
- `j` is 1
- `m` is greater than 0
- `a` is `p1[2 * i]`
- `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`
- `c` is `p2[2 * j]`
- `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`
- `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` or `b` is within the range `(c, d)`
- `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`
- `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`

The code snippet sets `kandidat` to `b`. This means that regardless of the previous value of `kandidat`, it is now updated to `b`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is `b`, `cc[i]` contains `b`, and `dd[0]` contains `b`.**
