Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` or `b` is within the range `(c, d)`, `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`, and `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`. If both `a` and `b` are not within the range `(c, d)`, `kandidat` remains as it was determined initially.***

This postcondition covers the case where both `a` and `b` are within the range `(c, d)` and states that `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` based on which one falls within the specified range, with `cc[i]` and `dd[0]` both containing `kandidat`. It also handles the scenario where neither `a` nor `b` falls within the range, maintaining the initial value of `kandidat`.
