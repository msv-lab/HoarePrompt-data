Let's analyze the given state and the for loop to determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given State:
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `a` is `p1[2 * (i_prev + 1)]`.
- `b` is `p1[2 * (i_prev + 1) + 1]`.
- `c` is `p2[2 * j]`.
- `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`.
- `kandidat` is the last `kandidat` value added to `cand`, `cc[i_prev + 1]`, and `dd[j]`.
- `cand` contains all unique `kandidat` values from all iterations.
- `cc[i_prev + 1]` contains all `kandidat` values from all iterations where `j` is such that `2 * j < m`.
- `dd[j]` contains all `kandidat` values from all iterations where `j` is such that `2 * j < m`.

### For Loop:
```
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop `for j in range(m)` will execute if `m > 0`. Since the initial state already mentions that `m` is greater than 0, this condition is satisfied.

2. **Loop Variable Initialization**: The variable `j` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts. This is a standard behavior of the `range(m)` function, which generates values from `0` to `m-1`.

3. **Loop Iteration**: Each iteration of the loop increments `j` by 1 until `j` reaches `m`. 

Given these points, the primary state adjustments needed are:

- `j` should be set to `0` initially, as it is the starting point for the loop.
- `m` should remain as `greater than 0` since it is already stated and satisfies the loop condition.

### Final State Adjustment:
State: **`j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
