The code updates the values of `c` and `d`. Initially, `c` is `p2[2 * (j+1)]` and `d` is `p2[2 * (j+1) + 1]`. After the code executes, `c` becomes `p2[2 * j]` and `d` becomes `p2[2 * j + 1]`. The values of `i`, `m`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `cand`, `cc`, and `dd[j+1]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than `j+1`, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing either `a` or `b`, `cc[0]` contains `a` (or `b`), `dd[j+1]` is a set that now contains `kandidat` (either `p1[0]` or `p1[1`).**
