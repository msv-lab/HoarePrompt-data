The code `cand.add(kandidat)` adds the value of `kandidat` to the set `cand`. Since `cand` was initially a set containing `kandidat`, adding `kandidat` again does not change its contents because sets do not allow duplicate elements.

Therefore, the set `cand` remains unchanged. All other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[4]`, `d` is `p2[5]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` or `b` is within the range `(p2[4], p2[5])`, `cc[i]` is a set containing `kandidat`, `dd[0]` is `kandidat`, `dd[1]` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`.
