The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop is explicitly mentioned in the given code snippet, the effect of `continue` here is to indicate that the current iteration of the loop should be skipped. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`. The condition is that `a` is in the set containing `c` and `d` and `b` is also in the set containing `c` and `d`.**
