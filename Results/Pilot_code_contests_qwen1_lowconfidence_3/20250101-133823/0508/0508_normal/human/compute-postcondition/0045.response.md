`kandidat` is assigned the value of `b`. The value of `b` is `p1[1]`, so `kandidat` is now `p1[1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than `j + 2`, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing both `a` and `b`, `cc[0]` now contains both `a` and `b`, `dd[j + 1]` is a set containing either `a` or `b`, `dd[j + 2]` is a set that remains unchanged, and `kandidat` is `b`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than `j + 2`, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing both `a` and `b`, `cc[0]` now contains both `a` and `b`, `dd[j + 1]` is a set containing either `a` or `b`, `dd[j + 2]` is a set that remains unchanged, and `kandidat` is `b`.**
