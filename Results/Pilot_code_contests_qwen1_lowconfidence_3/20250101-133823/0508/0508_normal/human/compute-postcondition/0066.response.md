`cand.add(kandidat)` adds the value of `kandidat` to the set `cand`. The value of `kandidat` is determined based on the conditions given: if `a` is in the range `(c, d)`, then `kandidat` is `a`; otherwise, `kandidat` is `b`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; if `a` is in `(c, d)`, then `kandidat` is `a`; otherwise, `kandidat` is `b`; `cand` contains `kandidat`.**
