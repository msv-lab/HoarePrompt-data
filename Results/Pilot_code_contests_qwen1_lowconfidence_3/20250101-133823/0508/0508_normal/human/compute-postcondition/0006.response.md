Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Variables Involved in the Loop Condition**: The loop condition `for i in range(n)` means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 12.
   - `m` is an integer between 1 and 12.
   - `p2` is a list of integers obtained from user input.
   - `cand` is an empty set.
   - `cc` is a list of `n` empty sets.
   - `dd` is a list of `m` empty sets.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`. This implies that `n` must be greater than 0 (since `i` starts from 0).

4. **State Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since the loop will iterate `n` times, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1.
   - The value of `i` at the start of the loop will be 0.
   - The other variables (`m`, `p2`, `cand`, `cc`, `dd`) do not directly affect the loop condition and their values are not needed to be explicitly adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be greater than 0 (to ensure the loop can run).
- `i` is now 0 (the initial value for the loop variable).

Thus, the final answer is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
