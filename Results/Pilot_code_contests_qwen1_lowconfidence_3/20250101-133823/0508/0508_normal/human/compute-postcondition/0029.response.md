The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. The conditions and values of the variables before the `continue` statement remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than `j+1`, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing either `a` or `b`, `cc[0]` contains `a` (or `b`), `dd[j+1]` is a set that now contains `kandidat` (either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]`), if `a` is not in `(c, d)` and `b` is not in `(c, d)`, then `dd[j+1]` contains both `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `dd[j+1]` remains unchanged.**
