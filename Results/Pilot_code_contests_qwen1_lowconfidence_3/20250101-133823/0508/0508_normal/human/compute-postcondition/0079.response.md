The code `cand.add(kandidat)` adds the value of `kandidat` to the set `cand`. Since `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, and `cand` was previously containing `kandidat`, adding `kandidat` again does not change its contents. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`; `cand` contains `{kandidat}`; `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[j+1]` contains `kandidat`; if `a` is in `(c, d)`, `m` remains unchanged and `kandidat` is `a`. If `b` is in `(c, d)`, `m` remains unchanged and `kandidat` is `b`. Otherwise, `m` remains greater than 0.**
