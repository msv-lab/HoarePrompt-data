The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. Instead, it processes input provided through multiple lines. Specifically, it takes input consisting of:

- The first line contains `n` pairs of integers representing pairs communicated from the first participant to the second.
- The second line contains `m` pairs of integers representing pairs communicated from the second participant to the first.

All pairs within each set are distinct and contain two different numbers between 1 and 9. It is guaranteed that there is at least one pair from the first set and one pair from the second set that share exactly one number.

Based on this input, the function identifies a pair that is shared uniquely between the two sets of pairs and returns the shared number.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process the given input (consisting of `n` pairs and `m` pairs) and return the number that is shared uniquely between the two sets of pairs.

Functionality: **The function processes the given input consisting of `n` pairs and `m` pairs, and returns the number that is shared uniquely between the two sets of pairs.**
