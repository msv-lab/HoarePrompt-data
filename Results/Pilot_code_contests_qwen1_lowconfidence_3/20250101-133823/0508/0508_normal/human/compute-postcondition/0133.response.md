Postcondition: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[4]`, `d` is `p2[5]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` or `b` is within the range `(p2[4], p2[5])`, `cc[i]` is a set containing `kandidat`, `dd[0]` is `kandidat`, `dd[1]` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`. Since the `if` condition checks if both `a` and `b` are within the range `(c, d)`, and if this condition is true, the `continue` statement is executed, which implies no modification to any variables' values. Therefore, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition if the condition is met, and similarly, no change is needed if the condition is not met because the else part is absent.**
