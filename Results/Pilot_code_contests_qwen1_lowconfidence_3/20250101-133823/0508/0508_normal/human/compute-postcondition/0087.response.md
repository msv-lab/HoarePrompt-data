The code `continue` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the states of all the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`; `cand` contains `{kandidat}`; `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[prev_j + 1]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[prev_j + 2]` contains `kandidat`.**
