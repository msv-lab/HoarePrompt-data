The code `n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them, converting them into integers and assigning them to `n` and `m`. This means that the values of `n` and `m` are now specifically defined by the input, but the exact values are not specified in the problem statement. However, it is given that `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 12`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 12, and their specific values are defined by the input.**
