According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we have the following states:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `m` must be greater than `j + 1`
- `a` is `p1[0]`
- `b` is `p1[1]`
- `c` is `p2[2 * j]`
- `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`
- `cand` is a set containing both `a` and `b`
- `cc[0]` now contains both `a` and `b`
- `dd[j]` is a set containing either `a` or `b`
- `dd[j + 1]` is a set that remains unchanged
- `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)` or not

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m - 1` (since `m` must be greater than `j + 1`).

Assuming that the loop has executed for `j` iterations, `j` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` will be `j + 1`
- `m` must still be greater than `j + 1`

Therefore, the new state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than `j + 2`, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * (j + 1)]`, `d` is `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing both `a` and `b`, `cc[0]` now contains both `a` and `b`, `dd[j + 1]` is a set containing either `a` or `b`, `dd[j + 2]` is a set that remains unchanged, and `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)` or not.**

Simplified:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than `j + 2`, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * (j + 1)]`, `d` is `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing both `a` and `b`, `cc[0]` now contains both `a` and `b`, `dd[j + 1]` is a set containing either `a` or `b`, `dd[j + 2]` is a set that remains unchanged, and `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)` or not.**
