The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[0]`, `d` is `p2[1]`, `a` is not in `(c, d)`, and `b` is not in `(c, d)`**
