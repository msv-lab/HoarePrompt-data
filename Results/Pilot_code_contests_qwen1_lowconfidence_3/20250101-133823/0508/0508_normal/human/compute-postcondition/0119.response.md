The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, this statement does not affect any variables. All the variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` or `b` is within the range `(c, d)`, `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`, and `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`. If both `a` and `b` are not within the range `(c, d)`, `kandidat` remains as it was determined initially.**
