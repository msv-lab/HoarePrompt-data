`cand` is a set containing both `a` and `b`. The code `cand.add(kandidat)` adds the value of `kandidat` to the set `cand`. Since `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` (depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)` or not), adding `kandidat` to `cand` does not change the set because `kandidat` is already present in `cand`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than `j + 2`, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing both `a` and `b` and `kandidat`, `cc[0]` now contains both `a` and `b`, `dd[j + 1]` is a set containing either `a` or `b`, `dd[j + 2]` is a set that remains unchanged, and `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)` or not.**
