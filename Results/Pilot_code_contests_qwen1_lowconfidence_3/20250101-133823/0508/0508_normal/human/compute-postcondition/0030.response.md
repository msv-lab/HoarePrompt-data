Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than `j+1`, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing either `a` or `b`, `cc[0]` contains `a` (or `b`), `dd[j+1]` is a set that remains unchanged. If both `a` and `b` are in `(c, d)`, then `dd[j+1]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if neither `a` nor `b` is in `(c, d)`, `dd[j+1]` contains both `a` and `b`.***
