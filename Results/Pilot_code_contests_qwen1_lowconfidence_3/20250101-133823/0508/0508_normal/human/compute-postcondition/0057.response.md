Postcondition: ***`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; if `a` is not in `(c, d)` and `b` is not in `(c, d)`, these conditions hold. If either `a` or `b` is in `(c, d)`, these conditions do not change from the precondition.***
