The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables, but it indicates that the loop structure has been continued.

Given the initial state, none of the variables are modified by the `continue` statement. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged after the execution of the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than `j+1`, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing either `a` or `b`, `cc[0]` contains `a` (or `b`), `dd[j+1]` is a set that now contains `kandidat` (either `p1[0]` or `p1[1`).**
