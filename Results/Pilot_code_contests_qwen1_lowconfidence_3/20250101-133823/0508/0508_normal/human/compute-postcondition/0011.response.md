The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect the variables. The states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`. The current values of `a` and `b` are not in the set containing `c` and `d`.**
