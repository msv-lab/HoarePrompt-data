The code `dd = [set() for i in range(m)]` creates a new list `dd` containing `m` empty sets. Each element in this list is an empty set. The values of `n`, `m`, `p2`, `cand`, and `cc` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12; `m` is an integer between 1 and 12; `p2` is a list of integers obtained from user input; `cand` is an empty set; `cc` is a list of `n` empty sets; `dd` is a list of `m` empty sets.**
