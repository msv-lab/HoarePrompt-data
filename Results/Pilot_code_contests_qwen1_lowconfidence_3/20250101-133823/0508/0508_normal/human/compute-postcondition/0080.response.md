`cc[i].add(kandidat)` adds the value of `kandidat` to the set `cc[i]`. Since `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, and `a` is `p1[2 * i]` and `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, the set `cc[i]` will contain `kandidat`. The value of `kandidat` being added to `cc[i]` does not affect the values of `m`, `c`, `d`, `kandidat`, `cand`, `cc[i]`, `dd[j+1]`, and the condition checking whether `a` or `b` is in `(c, d)`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`; `cand` contains `{kandidat}`; `cc[i]` contains `kandidat` (after adding `kandidat`); `dd[j+1]` contains `kandidat`; if `a` is in `(c, d)`, `m` remains unchanged and `kandidat` is `a`. If `b` is in `(c, d)`, `m` remains unchanged and `kandidat` is `b`. Otherwise, `m` remains greater than 0.**
