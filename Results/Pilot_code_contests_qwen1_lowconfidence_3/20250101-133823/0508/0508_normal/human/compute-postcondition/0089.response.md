The code `kandidat = a` assigns the value of `a` to `kandidat`. Based on the initial state, `a` is `p1[2 * i]` and is either in `(c, d)` or not in `(c, d)`. The conditions of the variables remain unchanged if both `a` and `b` are in `(c, d)`, otherwise they remain unchanged.

Given the code updates `kandidat` to be `a`, the following changes occur:
- `kandidat` is now equal to `a`.
- The other variables (`b`, `c`, `d`, `cand`, `cc[i]`, `dd[prev_j + 1]`, `dd[prev_j + 2]`) remain unchanged because the code does not modify them.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is `a`; `cand` contains `{kandidat}`; `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[prev_j + 1]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[prev_j + 2]` contains `kandidat`. If `a` is in `(c, d)` and `b` is in `(c, d)`, the conditions of the variables remain unchanged. If either `a` or `b` is not in `(c, d)`, the conditions of the variables remain unchanged.**
