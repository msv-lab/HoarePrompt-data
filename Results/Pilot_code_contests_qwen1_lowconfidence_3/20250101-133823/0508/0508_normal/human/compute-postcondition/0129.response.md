The code snippet updates the values of `c` and `d` by setting `c` to `p2[2 * j]` and `d` to `p2[2 * j + 1]`. The value of `j` is initially 2, so `c` is updated to `p2[4]` and `d` is updated to `p2[5]`.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is 2
- `m` must be greater than 2
- `a` is `p1[2 * i]`
- `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`
- `c` is `p2[4]`
- `d` is `p2[5]`
- `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` or `b` is within the range `(c, d)`
- `cc[i]` is a set containing `kandidat`
- `dd[0]` is `kandidat`
- `dd[1]` is a set containing `kandidat`
- `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`

After executing the code snippet:
- `c` is now `p2[4]`
- `d` is now `p2[5]`

The states of other variables (`j`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `kandidat`, `cc[i]`, `dd[0]`, `dd[1]`, `cand`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[4]`, `d` is `p2[5]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` or `b` is within the range `(p2[4], p2[5])`, `cc[i]` is a set containing `kandidat`, `dd[0]` is `kandidat`, `dd[1]` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`**
