The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since the `continue` statement does not modify any variables and simply skips to the next iteration, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `a` is not in `(c, d)`; `b` is not in `(c, d)`**
