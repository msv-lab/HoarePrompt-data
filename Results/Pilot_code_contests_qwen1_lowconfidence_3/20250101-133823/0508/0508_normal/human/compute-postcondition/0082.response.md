According to the given code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` ranging from 0 to `m-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `m` is greater than 0
- `a` is `p1[2 * i]`
- `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`
- `c` is `p2[2 * j]`
- `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`
- `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`
- `cand` contains `{kandidat}`
- `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`
- `dd[j]` contains `kandidat`
- `dd[j+1]` contains `kandidat`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`. Since the loop has just completed an iteration where `j` was some value, say `j = prev_j`, the condition `prev_j < m` must hold true for the next iteration. Therefore, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it `prev_j + 1`.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

- The new value of `j` will be `prev_j + 1`.
- Since `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, and assuming no change in `p1` or `p2`, `c`, `d`, `a`, and `b` remain the same.
- `cand` still contains `{kandidat}`, `cc[i]` still contains `kandidat`, and `dd[j]` and `dd[j+1]` still contain `kandidat`, but now `j` is updated.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`m` is greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * (prev_j + 1)]`; `d` is `p2[2 * (prev_j + 1) + 1]`; `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`; `cand` contains `{kandidat}`; `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[prev_j + 1]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[prev_j + 2]` contains `kandidat`.**
