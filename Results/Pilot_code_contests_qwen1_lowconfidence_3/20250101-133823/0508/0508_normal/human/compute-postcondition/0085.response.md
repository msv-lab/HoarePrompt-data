The `continue` statement in the given code does not change the values of any variables. It merely skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop (if there is one) and proceeds to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`; `cand` contains `{kandidat}`; `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[prev_j + 1]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[prev_j + 2]` contains `kandidat`.**
