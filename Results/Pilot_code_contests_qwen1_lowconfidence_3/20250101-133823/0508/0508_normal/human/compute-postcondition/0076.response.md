The code assigns the value of `a` to `kandidat`. The value of `a` was previously defined as `p1[2 * i]`, and the values of `b`, `c`, and `d` were also defined as `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `p2[2 * j]`, and `p2[2 * j + 1]` respectively. The condition that `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` is still met, and `cand` contains `kandidat`, `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`, and `dd[j+1]` contains `kandidat`. The value of `m` remains greater than 0 because no condition for changing its value was triggered.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is `a`; `cand` contains `a`; `cc[i]` contains `a`; `dd[j+1]` contains `a`; `m` remains greater than 0.**
