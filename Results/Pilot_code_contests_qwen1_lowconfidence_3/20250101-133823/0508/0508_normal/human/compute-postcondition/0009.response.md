The code assigns `p2[2 * j]` to `c` and `p2[2 * j + 1]` to `d`. Since `j` is not defined in the initial state or the provided code snippet, it's unclear what specific values `c` and `d` will take. However, we can still list the impact on the variables involved.

- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `i` remains 0.
- `m` remains greater than 0.
- `a` remains `p1[0]`.
- `b` remains `p1[1]`.
- `c` is assigned `p2[2 * j]`.
- `d` is assigned `p2[2 * j + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`**
