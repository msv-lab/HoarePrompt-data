The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables; it only affects the flow of the loop. Given that no variables are being updated or changed by this statement, the values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`; `cand` contains `kandidat`; `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[j+1]` contains `kandidat`; `c` is now `p2[2 * j]` and `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]`**
