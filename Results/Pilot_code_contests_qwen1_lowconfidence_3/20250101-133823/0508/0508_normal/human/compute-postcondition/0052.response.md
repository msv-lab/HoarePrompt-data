According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute as long as `m` is at least 1. Given the initial states:

- `n` must be greater than 0 (though this does not affect the loop's execution directly)
- `i` is 1 (though this does not affect the loop's execution directly)
- `m` must be a non-negative integer (and specifically, for the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0)

The state of `cand`, `cc`, and `dd` may have been modified based on the loop body, but their current values do not affect the loop's ability to execute. The key adjustment needed is ensuring `m` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`m` must be greater than 0**
