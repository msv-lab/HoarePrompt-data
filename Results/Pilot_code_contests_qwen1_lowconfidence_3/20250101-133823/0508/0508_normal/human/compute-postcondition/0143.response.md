The code `print(cand.pop())` removes and returns the last element of the set `cand`. Since the length of the set `cand` is equal to 1, calling `pop()` will remove the only element from the set and print it. After this operation, the set `cand` will be empty.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is the index such that `2 * i` is the last valid index in `p1`, `m` must be a non-negative integer, `a` and `b` are elements from `p1` that satisfied the conditions, `c` and `d` are elements from `p2` that correspond to the current iteration, `kandidat` is the last `kandidat` value added to `cand`, `cc[i]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values from all iterations where `j` is such that `2 * j < m`, and `dd[j]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values from all iterations where `j` is such that `2 * j < m`; `cand` is an empty set**.
