The code updates the values of `c` and `d` to be `p2[2 * j]` and `p2[2 * j + 1]` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated values for `c` and `d` are specifically derived from the index-based access of the list `p2`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than `j + 2`, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing both `a` and `b`, `cc[0]` now contains both `a` and `b`, `dd[j + 1]` is a set containing either `a` or `b`, `dd[j + 2]` is a set that remains unchanged, and `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)` or not.**
