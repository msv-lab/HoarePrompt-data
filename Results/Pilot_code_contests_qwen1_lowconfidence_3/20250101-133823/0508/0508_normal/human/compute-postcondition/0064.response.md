The code `kandidat = b` assigns the value of `b` to the variable `kandidat`. The values of `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is `b`; neither `a` nor `b` is in `(c, d)`.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is `b`; neither `a` nor `b` is in `(c, d)`**
