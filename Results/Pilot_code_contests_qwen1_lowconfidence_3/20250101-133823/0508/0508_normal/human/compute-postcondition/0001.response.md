The code `p1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `p1`. The values of `n` and `m` are not directly affected by this code, but they are within the range of 1 to 12. The output state will include the new variable `p1` with the values converted from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer between 1 and 12, `p1` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input split by spaces**
