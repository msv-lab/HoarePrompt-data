The code snippet assigns `p1[2 * i]` to `a` and `p1[2 * i + 1]` to `b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are replaced by these new values. The other variables (`m`, `c`, `d`, `kandidat`, `cand`, `cc[i]`, `dd[prev_j + 1]`, `dd[prev_j + 2]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * (prev_j + 1)]`; `d` is `p2[2 * (prev_j + 1) + 1]`; `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`; `cand` contains `{kandidat}`; `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[prev_j + 1]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[prev_j + 2]` contains `kandidat`.**
