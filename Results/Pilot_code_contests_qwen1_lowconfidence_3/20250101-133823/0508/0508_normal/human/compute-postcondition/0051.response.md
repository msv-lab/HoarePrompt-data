Based on the given loop and the initial state, let's break down the process step-by-step to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

### Initial State
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `m` must be a non-negative integer.
- `p1` is a list of integers.
- `p2` is a list of pairs of integers.
- `cand` is a set initialized to an empty set.
- `cc` is a list of sets, initially containing empty sets.
- `dd` is a list of sets, initially containing empty sets.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over `i` in the range from `0` to `n - 1`. For each iteration:
- `a` is set to `p1[2 * i]`.
- `b` is set to `p1[2 * i + 1]`.
- `c` is set to `p2[2 * j]`.
- `d` is set to `p2[2 * j + 1]`.

The conditions inside the loop ensure that `a` and `b` are only added to `cand`, `cc[i]`, and `dd[j]` if they satisfy certain conditions:
- If neither `a` nor `b` is in `(c, d)`, the loop continues without adding anything.
- If both `a` and `b` are in `(c, d)`, the loop continues without adding anything.
- If either `a` or `b` is in `(c, d)`, `kandidat` is set to `a` or `b` based on which one is present, and `kandidat` is added to `cand`, `cc[i]`, and `dd[j]`.

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is 0 (since it starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration).
- The loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`.

### Final State Before the Next Iteration
- Since `i` is currently 0, the next iteration will start with `i` incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
- The loop will then check the condition for `i = 1`.

### Adjusted State for the Next Iteration
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `i` will be incremented to 1.
- `m` must still be a non-negative integer.
- `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged.
- `cand`, `cc`, and `dd` will be modified based on the conditions inside the loop, but the specific values depend on the loop body, which is omitted.

### Output State
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` must be a non-negative integer, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `cand`, `cc`, and `dd` may have been modified based on the loop body.**

In summary:
- `n` remains the same as it must be greater than 0.
- `i` is incremented to 1.
- `m` remains the same as it must be a non-negative integer.
- `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged as no modifications are specified.
- `cand`, `cc`, and `dd` may have been modified by the loop body but their exact values are not specified here.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` must be a non-negative integer, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `cand`, `cc`, and `dd` may have been modified based on the loop body.**
