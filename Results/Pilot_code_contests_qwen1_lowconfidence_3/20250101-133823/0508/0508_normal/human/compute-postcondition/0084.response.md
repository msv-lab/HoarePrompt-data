The code updates the values of `c` and `d`. Specifically, `c` is assigned the value of `p2[2 * j]` and `d` is assigned the value of `p2[2 * j + 1]`. The other variables (`m`, `a`, `b`, `kandidat`, `cand`, `cc`, `dd`) remain unchanged from their previous values.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`; `cand` contains `{kandidat}`; `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[prev_j + 1]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[prev_j + 2]` contains `kandidat`.**
