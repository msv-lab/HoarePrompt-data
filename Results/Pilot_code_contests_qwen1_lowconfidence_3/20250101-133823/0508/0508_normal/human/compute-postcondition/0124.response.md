`kandidat` is added to the set `cand`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` or `b` is within the range `(c, d)`, `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`, and `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` or `b` is within the range `(c, d)`, `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`.**
