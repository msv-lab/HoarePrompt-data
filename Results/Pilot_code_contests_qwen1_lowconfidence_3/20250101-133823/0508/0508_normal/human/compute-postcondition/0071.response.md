The code snippet assigns `p2[2 * j]` to `c` and `p2[2 * j + 1]` to `d`. The values of `c` and `d` were previously defined as `c = p2[2 * j]` and `d = p2[2 * j + 1]`, respectively. After executing the code, these assignments are updated according to the new values from `p2`.

The states of the other variables (`m`, `a`, `b`, `kandidat`, `cand`, `cc[i]`, `dd[j+1]`) are not affected.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`; `cand` contains `kandidat`; `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[j+1]` contains `kandidat`; `c` is now `p2[2 * j]` and `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]`**
