The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and goes to the next iteration without executing any code in the loop body for the current iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and the conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; if either `a` or `b` is in `(c, d)`, these conditions hold.**
