The code `cc[i].add(kandidat)` adds the value of `kandidat` to the set `cc[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `j` is 1
- `m` is greater than 0
- `a` is `p1[2 * i]`
- `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`
- `c` is `p2[2 * j]`
- `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`
- `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` or `b` is within the range `(c, d)`
- `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`
- `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`
- `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`

After executing `cc[i].add(kandidat)`, the value of `kandidat` is added to the set `cc[i]`. Since `cc[i]` already contains `kandidat`, adding `kandidat` again does not change its contents. However, the set `cc[i]` will now be a set containing only `kandidat`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` or `b` is within the range `(c, d)`, `cc[i]` is a set containing `kandidat`, `dd[0]` is `kandidat`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`**
