The code snippet adds the `kandidat` to the set `dd[j]`. Since `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, and the other variables remain unchanged, we can summarize the changes as follows:

- `dd[j]` now includes the value of `kandidat`.
- All other variables remain in their previous states.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`m` is greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`; `cand` contains `{kandidat}`; `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[prev_j + 1]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[prev_j + 2]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[j]` now contains the value of `kandidat`.**
