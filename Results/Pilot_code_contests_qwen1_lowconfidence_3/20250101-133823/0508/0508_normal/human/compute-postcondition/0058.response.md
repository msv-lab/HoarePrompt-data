Postcondition: ***`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; if either `a` or `b` is in `(c, d)`, these conditions hold. The current value of `a` and `b` is such that both are in `(c, d)`.***

This postcondition maintains all the information from the precondition and includes the additional condition specified in the if statement.
