The code `cand.add(kandidat)` adds the `kandidat` to the set `cand`. Since `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, the set `cand` will contain the element `kandidat`. The conditions of the variables remain unchanged if either `a` or `b` is not in `(c, d)`. If both `a` and `b` are in `(c, d)`, the conditions of the variables remain unchanged.

The Output State is:
**`m` is greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`; `cand` contains `{kandidat}`; `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[prev_j + 1]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[prev_j + 2]` contains `kandidat`; `cand` is now a set containing the value of `kandidat`.**
