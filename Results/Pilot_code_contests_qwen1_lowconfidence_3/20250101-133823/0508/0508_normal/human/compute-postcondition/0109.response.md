`kandidat` is assigned the value of `b`. The values of `j`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged. The condition about `a` and `b` not being in `(c, d)` is still valid.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[0]`, `d` is `p2[1]`, `kandidat` is `b`, and either `a` is not in `(c, d)` or `b` is not in `(c, d)`**
