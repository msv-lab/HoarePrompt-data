The code `p2 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `p2`. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `n` and `m`, we will keep those variables unchanged in the output state.

The impact of the code is that `p2` is now a list of integers obtained from the user input. Since the initial state does not provide the exact values of `p1` or `p2`, we cannot determine the exact content of `p2`, but we know it is derived from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer between 1 and 12, `p2` is a list of integers obtained from user input**
