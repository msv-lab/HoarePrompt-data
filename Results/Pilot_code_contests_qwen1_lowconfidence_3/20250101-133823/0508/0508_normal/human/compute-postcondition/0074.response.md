The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, the given code does not specify which loop this `continue` statement belongs to. Since no loop context is provided, we can only conclude that the loop or conditional block containing this statement will continue to its next iteration without changing the values of the variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`; `cand` contains `kandidat`; `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[j+1]` contains `kandidat`; if `a` is not in `(c, d)` and `b` is not in `(c, d)`, `m` remains greater than 0.**
