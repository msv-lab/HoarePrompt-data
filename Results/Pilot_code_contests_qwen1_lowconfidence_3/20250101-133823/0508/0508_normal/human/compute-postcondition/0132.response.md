The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since no loop was specified, the `continue` statement does not affect any variable values directly but simply skips to the next iteration if it were inside a loop. Given the initial state, none of the variables are modified by the `continue` statement, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[4]`, `d` is `p2[5]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` or `b` is within the range `(p2[4], p2[5])`, `cc[i]` is a set containing `kandidat`, `dd[0]` is `kandidat`, `dd[1]` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`.
