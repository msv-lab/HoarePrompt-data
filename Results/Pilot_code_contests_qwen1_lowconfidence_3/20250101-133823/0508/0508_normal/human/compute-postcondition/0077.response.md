The variable `kandidat` is reassigned to the value of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is `b`; `cand` contains `b`; `cc[i]` contains `b`; `dd[j+1]` contains `b`; if both `a` and `b` are not in `(c, d)`, `m` remains greater than 0. Otherwise, the conditions related to `a` and `b` being in `(c, d)` are met, but `m` remains unchanged.**
