`kandidat` is assigned the value of `a`. The value of `a` is `p1[2 * i]`. No changes are made to `j` and `m` since the if condition does not execute. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[0]`, `d` is `p2[1]`, `kandidat` is `p1[2 * i]`**
