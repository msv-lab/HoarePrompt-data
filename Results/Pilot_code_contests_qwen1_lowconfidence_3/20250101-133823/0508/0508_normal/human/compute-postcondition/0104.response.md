The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration without executing any statements after the `continue` statement. The values of the variables are not changed, and the loop continues its execution with the next iteration.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[0]`, `d` is `p2[1]`, and both `a` is in `(c, d)` and `b` is in `(c, d)`**
