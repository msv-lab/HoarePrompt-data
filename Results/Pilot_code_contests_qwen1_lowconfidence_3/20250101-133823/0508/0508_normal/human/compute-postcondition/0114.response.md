According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.
- Since `m` is greater than 0, it remains unchanged.
- The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `kandidat`, `cc[i]`, and `dd[j]` remain the same as they were at the end of the last iteration because the loop body is omitted and we are only concerned with the iteration condition.

State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[0]`, `d` is `p2[1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is within the range `(c, d)`, `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`, and `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`.**
