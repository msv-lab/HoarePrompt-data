The variable `kandidat` is assigned the value of `a`. The value of `a` is in the set containing `c` and `d`. The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is `a`, and `b` is also in the set containing `c` and `d`.**
