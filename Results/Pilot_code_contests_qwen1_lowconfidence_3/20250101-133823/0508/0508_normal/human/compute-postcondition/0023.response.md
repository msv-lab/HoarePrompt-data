The code `dd[j].add(kandidat)` adds the variable `kandidat` to the set `dd[j]`. The value of `kandidat` is given by the set `cand`, which contains either `a` or `b`. Since `a` is `p1[0]` and `b` is `p1[1]`, `kandidat` can be either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing either `a` or `b`, `cc[0]` contains `a` (or `b`), `dd[j]` is a set that now contains `kandidat` (either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]`).**
