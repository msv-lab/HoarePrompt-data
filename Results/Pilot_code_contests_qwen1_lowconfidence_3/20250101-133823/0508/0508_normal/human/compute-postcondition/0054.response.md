The code assigns values from `p2` to `c` and `d`. Specifically, `c` is assigned the value of `p2[2 * j]` and `d` is assigned the value of `p2[2 * j + 1]`. The values of `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`**
