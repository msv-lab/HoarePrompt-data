The code `a, b = p1[2 * i], p1[2 * i + 1]` assigns the values from the list `p1` to the variables `a` and `b`. Specifically, `a` is assigned the value at index `2 * i` of `p1`, and `b` is assigned the value at index `2 * i + 1` of `p1`. The other variables (`j`, `m`, `c`, `d`, `kandidat`, `cc[i]`, and `dd[0]`) are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `a` is now `p1[2 * i]`
- `b` is now `p1[2 * i + 1]`

Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[0]`, `d` is `p2[1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is within the range `(c, d)`, `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`, and `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`.**
