Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is `p1[2 * i]`.
   - `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`.
   - `c` is `p2[2 * j]`.
   - `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`.
   - `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`.
   - `cand` contains `kandidat`.
   - `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`.
   - `dd[j]` contains `kandidat`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` using `range(m)`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value less than `m`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` must now be less than `m-1` if the previous `j` was `m-2`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `m` remains the same as it must still be greater than 0.
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `kandidat`, `cand`, `cc[i]`, and `dd[j]` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop itself but by the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` from `p1` and `p2` respectively.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `j+1` and must still be less than `m`.

So, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

**State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`; `cand` contains `kandidat`; `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[j+1]` contains `kandidat`**.
