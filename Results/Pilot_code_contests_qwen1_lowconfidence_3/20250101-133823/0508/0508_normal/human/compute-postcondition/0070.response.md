The code assigns `p1[2 * i]` to `a` and `p1[2 * i + 1]` to `b`. The values of `m`, `c`, `d`, `kandidat`, `cand`, `cc[i]`, and `dd[j+1]` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`; `cand` contains `kandidat`; `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[j+1]` contains `kandidat`**
