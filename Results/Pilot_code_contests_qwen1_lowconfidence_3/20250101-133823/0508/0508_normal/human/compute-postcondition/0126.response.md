The code snippet adds the variable `kandidat` to the set `dd[j]`. The initial state shows that `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are elements from `p1`, `c` and `d` are elements from `p2`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on its position in the range defined by `c` and `d`, and `dd[0]` is initialized with `kandidat`.

After executing `dd[j].add(kandidat)`, the set `dd[j]` (which corresponds to `dd[1]` since `j` is 1) will contain the element `kandidat`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` or `b` is within the range `(c, d)`, `cc[i]` is a set containing `kandidat`, `dd[0]` is `kandidat`, `dd[1]` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`**
