Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[4]`, `d` is `p2[5]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` or `b` is within the range `(p2[4], p2[5])`, `cc[i]` is a set containing `kandidat`, `dd[0]` is `kandidat`, `dd[1]` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`. If `a` is within the range `(p2[4], p2[5])`, `kandidat` is `a`. Otherwise, `kandidat` is `b`.***

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, covering both the if and else parts while maintaining the conditions specified in the precondition.
