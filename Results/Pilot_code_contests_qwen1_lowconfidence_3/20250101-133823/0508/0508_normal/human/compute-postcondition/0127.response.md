According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `j` and `m`. The loop can execute again if `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `m` must still be greater than 2.

Let's break down the relevant states:
- `j` will be incremented from 1 to 2.
- `m` must remain greater than 0 and now specifically must be greater than 2 since `j` is incremented to 2.

Now, let's update the states for the next iteration:

- `a` remains `p1[2 * i]`.
- `b` remains `p1[2 * i + 1]`.
- `c` remains `p2[2 * j]`, but now `j` is 2, so `c` is `p2[4]`.
- `d` remains `p2[2 * j + 1]`, so `d` is `p2[5]`.
- `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` or `b` is within the range `(c, d)`.
- `cc[i]` is a set containing `kandidat`.
- `dd[0]` is `kandidat`.
- `dd[1]` is a set containing `kandidat`.
- `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`.

State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[4]`, `d` is `p2[5]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` or `b` is within the range `(c, d)`, `cc[i]` is a set containing `kandidat`, `dd[0]` is `kandidat`, `dd[1]` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`**
