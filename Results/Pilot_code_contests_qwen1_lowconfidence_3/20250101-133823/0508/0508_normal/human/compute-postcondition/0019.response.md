The variable `kandidat` is assigned the value of `b`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `i` remains 0, `m` remains greater than 0, `a` is still `p1[0]`, `b` is still `p1[1]`, `c` is still `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is still `p2[2 * j + 1]`, and the conditions involving `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is `b`**
