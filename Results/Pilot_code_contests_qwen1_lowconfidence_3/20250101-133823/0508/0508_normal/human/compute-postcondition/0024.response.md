Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is `p1[0]`.
   - `b` is `p1[1]`.
   - `c` is `p2[2 * j]`.
   - `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`.
   - `cand` is a set containing either `a` or `b`.
   - `cc[0]` contains `a` (or `b`).
   - `dd[j]` is a set that now contains `kandidat` (either `p1[0]` or `p1[1`).

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for j in range(m):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute again if `j < m-1`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - Since `j` was previously used, we assume it was the last `j` value before the loop started. For the next iteration, `j` should be `j+1`.
   - The condition `m` must still be greater than 0 because `m` is the upper limit of the range.
   - All other states (`n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `cand`, `cc[0]`, `dd[j]`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the loop.

5. **Final State:**
   - `j` must be less than `m` for the loop to execute again.
   - Since `j` was previously `j` (let's say `j = k`), for the next iteration, `j` becomes `k+1`.
   - Therefore, `m` must be greater than `k+1` (where `k` is the previous value of `j`).

Given this analysis, the new state for the next iteration would be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than `j+1`, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * (j+1)]`, `d` is `p2[2 * (j+1) + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing either `a` or `b`, `cc[0]` contains `a` (or `b`), `dd[j+1]` is a set that now contains `kandidat` (either `p1[0]` or `p1[1`).**
