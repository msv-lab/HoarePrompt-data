Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[4]`, `d` is `p2[5]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` or `b` is within the range `(p2[4], p2[5])`, `cc[i]` is a set containing `kandidat`, `dd[0]` is `kandidat`, `dd[1]` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`. If `a` is not in `(c, d)` and `b` is not in `(c, d)`, then `kandidat` remains unchanged, and `cc[i]`, `dd[0]`, `dd[1]`, and `cand` continue to contain `kandidat`.***
