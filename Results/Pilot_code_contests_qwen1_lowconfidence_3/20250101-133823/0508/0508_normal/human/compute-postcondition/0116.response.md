The code updates the values of `c` and `d` by assigning `p2[2 * j]` to `c` and `p2[2 * j + 1]` to `d`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect these changes.

- `j` remains 1.
- `m` remains greater than 0.
- `a` remains `p1[2 * i]`.
- `b` remains `p1[2 * i + 1]`.
- `c` is updated to `p2[2 * j]`.
- `d` is updated to `p2[2 * j + 1]`.
- `kandidat` remains either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is within the range `(c, d)`.
- `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`.
- `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is within the range `(c, d)`, `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`, and `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`.**
