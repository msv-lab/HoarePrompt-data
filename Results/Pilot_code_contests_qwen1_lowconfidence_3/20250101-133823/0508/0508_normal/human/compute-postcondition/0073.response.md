Postcondition: ***`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`; `cand` contains `kandidat`; `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[j+1]` contains `kandidat`; if `a` is not in `(c, d)` and `b` is not in `(c, d)`, `m` remains greater than 0.***
