Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is the index such that `2 * i` is the last valid index in `p1`, `m` must be a non-negative integer, `a` and `b` are elements from `p1` that satisfied the conditions, `c` and `d` are elements from `p2` that correspond to the current iteration, `kandidat` is the last `kandidat` value added to `cand`, `cc[i]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values from all iterations where `j` is such that `2 * j < m`, and `dd[j]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values from all iterations where `j` is such that `2 * j < m`. If the length of `cand` is 1, then `cand` remains an empty set. Otherwise, if the maximum length of sets `cc[i]` for all `i` in range `n` is less than or equal to 1 and the maximum length of sets `dd[i]` for all `i` in range `m` is less than or equal to 1, then 0 is printed to the console. Otherwise, -1 is printed to the console.***
