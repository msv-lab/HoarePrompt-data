The function processes two sets of pairs of integers, where each pair from the first set is communicated from the first participant to the second, and each pair from the second set is communicated from the second participant to the first. The function identifies if there is a number that is shared uniquely between these two sets of pairs. Specifically, it checks for a number that appears exactly once in the first set and also exactly once in the second set. If such a number is found, it prints the number. If no such number exists, it further checks if the maximum count of any number in either set is less than or equal to 1. If this condition is met, it prints 0, indicating that no number is shared uniquely. Otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that no unique shared number was found or that the condition failed. The function does not modify the input sets and returns nothing explicitly.
