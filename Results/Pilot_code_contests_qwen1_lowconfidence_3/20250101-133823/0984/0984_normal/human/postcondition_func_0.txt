The function accepts an integer `N` such that \(1 \leq N \leq 4000\) and a string `S` of length `N` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'. It calculates and returns the count of valid triplets `(i, j, k)` where:
1. `S[p[i]] = 'R'`, `S[q[j]] = 'G'`, and `S[r[k]] = 'B'`.
2. The triplet satisfies the condition `j < k` and there exists an index `m` such that `S[m] = 'G'` and `p[i] < m < r[k]` and `q[j]` is the closest 'G' between `m` and `r[k]`.

The function performs the following steps:
1. Reads the integer `N` and the string `S` from the standard input.
2. Creates a dictionary `d` where each key is a character ('R', 'G', or 'B') and the value is a list of all indices where that character appears in `S`.
3. Extracts lists `p`, `q`, and `r` corresponding to the indices of 'R', 'G', and 'B' characters respectively.
4. Iterates over all possible combinations of `p[i]`, `q[j]`, and `r[k]` to check if the conditions for a valid triplet are met.
5. Counts the number of valid triplets and stores the result in variable `z`.
6. Prints the count `z` to the standard output.

Potential edge cases:
- If `N` is less than 1 or greater than 4000, the function will still execute but will not process the input correctly as the constraints are not checked.
- If `S` does not contain any of the characters 'R', 'G', or 'B', the function will still run but `p`, `q`, and `r` will be empty lists, resulting in `z` being zero.
- The function assumes that `S` contains at least one of each character ('R', 'G', and 'B'), which might not always be the case.
