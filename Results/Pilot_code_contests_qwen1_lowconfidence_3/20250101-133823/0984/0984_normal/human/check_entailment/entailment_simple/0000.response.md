Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the logic used to count the valid triplets \((i, j, k)\) does not fully adhere to the constraints and conditions specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Condition Check Implementation**:
   - The program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find positions where the conditions are met. However, the logic for checking the conditions \(S_i \neq S_j, S_i \neq S_k,\) and \(S_j \neq S_k\) and ensuring \(j - i \neq k - j\) is not properly implemented.

2. **Triple Counting**:
   - The program attempts to count valid triplets by iterating over the indices of each character type ('R', 'G', 'B') and checking if certain conditions are met using binary search. However, this approach does not correctly account for all valid triplets. For instance, it does not ensure that \(j - i \neq k - j\).

3. **Misinterpretation of Conditions**:
   - The condition \(j - i \neq k - j\) is not properly checked in the current implementation. The program uses binary search to find matching indices, but it does not ensure that the difference between the indices is not equal to the required value.

To illustrate with an example, consider the input:
```
4
RRGB
```
- The expected output is `1` because the only valid triplet is \((1, 2, 3)\) where \(S_1 = R\), \(S_2 = R\), and \(S_3 = B\). However, the current implementation might not correctly identify this triplet due to the misinterpretation of the conditions.

### Correct Approach:
A more accurate approach would involve:
1. **Iterate Over All Possible Triplets**: Instead of using binary search, iterate over all possible triplets directly.
2. **Check Conditions**: For each triplet \((i, j, k)\), check if \(S_i \neq S_j, S_i \neq S_k,\) and \(S_j \neq S_k\).
3. **Ensure \(j - i \neq k - j\)**: Ensure that the difference between indices satisfies the condition \(j - i \neq k - j\).

By directly checking all possible triplets, the program can accurately count the valid ones without the need for complex binary search operations.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation does not correctly follow the problem description, leading to incorrect results in some cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
