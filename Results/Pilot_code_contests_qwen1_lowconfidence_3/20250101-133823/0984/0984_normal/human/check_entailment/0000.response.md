Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over all possible triplets (i, j, k) and checking the conditions. However, the implementation contains several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Condition Checking**: The logic to check if \( j - i \neq k - j \) is not implemented correctly. The program uses sorting and binary search to find a suitable third element but does not properly enforce the condition \( j - i \neq k - j \).

2. **Potential Overlap Handling**: The program does not handle overlapping conditions properly. For instance, it might count some triplets more than once or miss some valid triplets due to the way it checks and counts elements.

To illustrate, consider the following example:
- Input: `N = 5`, `S = "RGBRG"`
- Expected Output: The number of valid triplets should be calculated based on the conditions.

Let's manually check a few valid and invalid triplets:
- Valid triplets: (1, 3, 5), (1, 4, 5), (2, 4, 5)
- Invalid triplets: (1, 3, 4) because \( j - i = k - j \)

The provided program fails to correctly count these triplets. For instance, it might incorrectly include (1, 3, 4) as a valid triplet.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem requirements for every potential case and hence is incorrect.
