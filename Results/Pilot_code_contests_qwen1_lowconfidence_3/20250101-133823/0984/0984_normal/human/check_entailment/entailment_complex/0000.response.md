Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the program's logic for counting valid triplets does not correctly satisfy the conditions stated in the problem description.

#### Problem Description Requirements:
1. **Condition 1:** `S_i \neq S_j, S_i \neq S_k, and S_j \neq S_k`.
2. **Condition 2:** `j - i \neq k - j`.

#### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Implementation of Condition 2:**
   - The program checks for the condition `j - i != k - j` by comparing the positions of indices `p[i]`, `q[j]`, and `r[k]` using `bisect` for finding the position of `2 * l[1] - l[0]` in the other lists (`p`, `q`, and `r`). However, this approach is not sufficient to ensure that `j - i != k - j`. The program should explicitly check the differences between the indices.

2. **Incomplete Triple Counting Logic:**
   - The program iterates over all possible combinations of `p[i]`, `q[j]`, and `r[k]` but does not ensure that the indices `i`, `j`, and `k` form valid triplets according to the given conditions.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly implement the solution, the program should:
1. Store the indices of 'R', 'G', and 'B' in separate lists.
2. Iterate over all possible triplets `(i, j, k)` and check the conditions:
   - Ensure `S[p[i]] = 'R'`, `S[q[j]] = 'G'`, and `S[r[k]] = 'B'`.
   - Ensure `j - i != k - j`.

Here is a revised version of the program that correctly implements the solution:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    r_indices = [i for i, char in enumerate(s) if char == 'R']
    g_indices = [i for i, char in enumerate(s) if char == 'G']
    b_indices = [i for i, char in enumerate(s) if char == 'B']

    z = 0
    for i in r_indices:
        for j in g_indices:
            for k in b_indices:
                if j > i and k > j and j - i != k - j:
                    z += 1

    print(z)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Revised Program:
1. **Extract Indices:**
   - The program extracts the indices of 'R', 'G', and 'B' from the string `s` into separate lists `r_indices`, `g_indices`, and `b_indices`.

2. **Iterate Over Triplets:**
   - The program iterates over all possible triplets `(i, j, k)` formed by indices from the respective lists.
   - It ensures that `j - i != k - j` and increments the count `z` if the conditions are satisfied.

By implementing the solution this way, the program correctly counts the number of valid triplets according to the problem description.
