Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the code checks for the condition `j - i ≠ k - j`, which is not part of the problem statement. The problem requires counting triples `(i, j, k)` such that `S_i ≠ S_j`, `S_i ≠ S_k`, and `S_j ≠ S_k`, and additionally, `j - i ≠ k - j`. However, the code does not enforce the latter condition. Instead, it counts triplets based on the presence of 'G' between 'R' and 'B' characters, which is not aligned with the problem requirements. Therefore, the code does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
