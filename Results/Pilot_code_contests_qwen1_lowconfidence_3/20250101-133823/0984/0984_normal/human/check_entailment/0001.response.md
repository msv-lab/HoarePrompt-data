Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. It uses dictionaries to store the indices of each character ('R', 'G', 'B') in the string and then iterates through these indices to count valid triples (i, j, k) that meet the specified conditions.

The program handles all potential cases by considering all possible combinations of characters and ensuring that the difference between indices is not equal. The use of `bisect` helps in efficiently finding the correct positions to count valid triples.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution seems to cover all necessary scenarios without missing any edge cases or misinterpreting the conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
