Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that prevent it from meeting the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Handling of Constraints**: The code does not explicitly check if the constraints \(1 \leq N \leq 4000\) are satisfied. While this might not cause an error due to the assumption that valid input will be provided, it is necessary to ensure the code behaves correctly within the specified range.

2. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle the case where the string `S` consists only of one or two types of characters ('R', 'G', or 'B'). In such cases, the logic for counting valid triplets would not work as intended because there would be no valid triplets that satisfy the conditions.

3. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic for counting valid triplets is flawed. The code uses binary search (`bisect`) to find the positions of other characters, but it does not correctly handle the condition `j - i \neq k - j`. Specifically, the logic inside the loops for checking the conditions is not properly ensuring that the indices `i`, `j`, and `k` are distinct and meet the required conditions.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- **Input**:
  ```
  4
  RRGB
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  1
  ```

However, running the provided code with this input gives an incorrect result. The code fails to correctly identify the valid triplet `(1, 2, 3)` because it does not properly account for the condition `j - i \neq k - j`.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case, hence the verdict is **False**.
