Postcondition: ***`p1` is greater than 0, `len(q)` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `q[j]`, `to` is the index where `l[1]` would be inserted in the sorted list `r`, `isTrue` is the index at which `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted into the list `r[to:]` to maintain the sorted order. If `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is updated by `z += r1 - to - 1`. Otherwise, `z` is increased by `r1 - to`.***
