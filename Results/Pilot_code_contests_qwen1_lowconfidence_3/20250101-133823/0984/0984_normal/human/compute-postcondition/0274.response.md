Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Initial State**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as "Output State:". However, since there is no specific state mentioned in the "Output State:", we need to infer the state based on the for loop and its context.

2. **Understand the For Loop**: The for loop is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for i in range(len(p)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each index `i` in the range from `0` to `len(p) - 1`. This means:
   - If `i` is the current index, then the loop will run until `i` reaches `len(p) - 1`.

4. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it iterates, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be one less than the maximum value it could take.
   - Therefore, if the loop has just completed its previous iteration, `i` must be `len(p) - 2`.

5. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `len(p) - 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < len(p)`, so `i` must be `len(p) - 1` for the next iteration.
   - The variable `p` itself does not change within the loop body (since only `i` is modified), so the length of `p` remains the same.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `len(p) - 1`, `p` must have at least `len(p)` elements**
