The code `d[i] = []` adds an empty list as the value to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since `i` is the next character in the string `s`, the value of `i` depends on the current character in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Let's denote the first character in the string `s` as `c`.

- The dictionary `d` now has the key `c` mapped to an empty list `[]`.
- The variable `i` is updated to the next character in the string `s`, which is the second character of `s`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n - 1 \leq 4000\), `s` is a non-empty string of length \(n - 1\) consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B', `d` is a dictionary containing the key `c` (where `c` is the first character in `s`) mapped to an empty list `[]`, `i` is the second character in the string `s`.**
