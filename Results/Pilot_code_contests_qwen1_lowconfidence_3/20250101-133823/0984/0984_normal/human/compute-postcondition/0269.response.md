`z` is incremented by the value of `q1 - to`. The previous value of `z` is unknown, so it remains unchanged in terms of its specific value. The values of `q1` and `to` are known from the initial state.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `to` is the index in `q` where `l[1]` (which is `min(p[i], r[j + 1])`) would be inserted to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted in the sublist `q[to:]`, `z` is increased by `q1 - to`**
