The code `isTrue = bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])` impacts the `isTrue` variable. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The value of `l` is `[q[i], r[2]]` sorted. Since `r` remains a non-empty list and `r[2]` is part of `l`, we know `l[1]` is `r[2]` and `l[0]` is the first element in the sorted list, which is `q[i]`.
2. The value of `to` is `bisect.bisect_left(p, r[2])`. This means `to` is the index in `p` where `r[2]` would be inserted to keep `p` sorted.
3. The expression `2 * l[1] - l[0]` translates to `2 * r[2] - q[i]`.
4. The code sets `isTrue` to the result of `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * r[2] - q[i])`, which is the number of elements in `p[to:]` that are less than `2 * r[2] - q[i]`.

Since the exact values of `q[i]`, `r[2]`, and `p` are not specified, we can express the final value of `isTrue` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`r` remains a non-empty list, `j` is 2, `l` is `[q[i], r[2]]` sorted, `to` is `bisect.bisect_left(p, r[2])`, `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * r[2] - q[i])`, `z` remains the same**
