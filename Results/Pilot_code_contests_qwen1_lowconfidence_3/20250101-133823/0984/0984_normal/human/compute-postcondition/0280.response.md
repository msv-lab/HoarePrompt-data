`z` is incremented by the value of `q1 - to - 1`. Given the initial state, `q1` is a variable that holds some value, `to` is the index in `q` where `l[1]` should be inserted to maintain sorted order, and the difference `q1 - to - 1` is added to `z`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `len(p) - 1`, `p` must have at least `len(p)` elements, `r` must have at least 1 element, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`, `to` is the index in `q` where `l[1]` should be inserted to maintain sorted order, `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` should be inserted into `q[to:]` to maintain sorted order, and the value at `q[to:]` is such that `q[to + isTrue]` equals `2 * l[1] - l[0]; z is incremented by `q1 - to - 1`.**
