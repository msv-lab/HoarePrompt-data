Let's break down the given scenario step by step:

1. **Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\).
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'.
   - `d` is an empty dictionary.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in s:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - For the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string. Since `n` is defined as the length of `s`, and \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\), `s` must have at least one character (i.e., `n` must be greater than or equal to 1).

4. **Required Adjustments:**
   - `s` must be a non-empty string, meaning `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - The variable `i` will take on each character in `s` during each iteration of the loop, but since we are only concerned with the initial state, we do not need to specify `i` explicitly in the state.

5. **Final State:**
   - The initial state should reflect that `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` and `d` remains an empty dictionary.

Therefore, the state to adjust for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B', `d` is an empty dictionary**
