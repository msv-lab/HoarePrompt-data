Output State: **`z` is the count of valid pairs `[p[i], q[j]]` such that there exists an index `k` in `r` where `r[k] == 2 * q[j] - p[i]`, `p1` is the length of list `p`, `q1` is the length of list `q`, `r1` is the length of list `r`, `p` is a list of all indices where the character 'R' appears in the string `s`, `q` is a list of all indices where the character 'G' appears in the string `s`, `r` is a list of all indices where the character 'B' appears in the string `s`, `i` is the last processed index in `q` (or -1 if no valid pairs were found), `j` is the last processed index in `r` (or -1 if no valid pairs were found).**

Explanation:
1. The loop iterates over each element in list `q` and list `r` using nested loops.
2. For each pair `[q[i], r[j]]`, it checks if there exists an index `k` in list `r` such that `r[k] == 2 * q[j] - p[i]`.
3. It uses binary search (`bisect.bisect_left`) to find the appropriate positions in list `p` and checks if the condition is met.
4. If the condition is met, it updates the count `z` based on the position of `p[i]` in list `p`.
5. After all iterations, `z` will contain the count of valid pairs, and `i` and `j` will be the last processed indices in lists `q` and `r`, respectively. If no valid pairs are found, `i` and `j` will be -1.
