The code `q1 = len(q)` calculates the length of the list `q` and assigns it to the variable `q1`. Since `q` is a list of all indices where the character 'G' appears in the string `s`, the length of `q` is stored in `q1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\); `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a character in `s` ('R', 'G', or 'B') and the value is a list of all indices where that character appears in `s`; `p` is a list of all indices where the character 'R' appears in the string `s`; `q` is a list of all indices where the character 'G' appears in the string `s`; `r` is the list of all indices where the character 'B' appears in the string `s`; `p1` is the length of the list `p`; `q1` is the length of the list `q`.**
