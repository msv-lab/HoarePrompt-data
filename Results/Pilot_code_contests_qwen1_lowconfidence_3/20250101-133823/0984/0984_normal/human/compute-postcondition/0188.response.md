`z` is incremented by `p1 - to`. The value of `p1 - to` is not specified in the initial state, but the initial state indicates that `isTrue` is assigned the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, and the element at `p[to:][isTrue]` is not equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`. The values of `l`, `q`, `r`, and `to` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`isTrue` is assigned the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, the element at `p[to:][isTrue]` is not equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`, `z` is incremented by `p1 - to`, `l` remains unchanged, `q` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, and `to` remains unchanged.**
