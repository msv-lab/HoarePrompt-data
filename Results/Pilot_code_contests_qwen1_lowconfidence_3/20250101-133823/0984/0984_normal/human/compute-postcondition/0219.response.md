Postcondition: **`z` is the count of valid pairs, `p1` is the length of list `p`, `q1` is the length of list `q`, `r1` is the length of list `r`, `p` is a list of all indices where the character 'R' appears in the string `s`, `q` is a list of all indices where the character 'G' appears in the string `s`, `r` is a list of all indices where the character 'B' appears in the string `s`, `i` is -1 or within the bounds of list `p`, `j` is within the bounds of list `r` (not -1), `l` is sorted([p[i], r[j]]), `to` is the index in `q` where `l[1]` should be inserted to maintain order, `isTrue` is the index found by bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0]), `q[to:][isTrue]` is not equal to 2 * l[1] - l[0]**
