The code `z += r1 - to` updates the value of `z` by adding `r1 - to` to its current value. However, the initial values of `z`, `r1`, and `to` are unknown. Therefore, we can only express the updated value of `z` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`z` is its original value plus `r1 - to`, `r1` is unchanged, `to` is unchanged**
