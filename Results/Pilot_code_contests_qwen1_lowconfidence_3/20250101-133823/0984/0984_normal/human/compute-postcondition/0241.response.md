### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Points Where Exceptions Can Occur
1. **Indexing and Slicing**: The expression `q[to:][isTrue]` involves slicing `q` starting from index `to` and then indexing into this slice using `isTrue`. This can fail if `to` is out of bounds or if `isTrue` is out of bounds within the sliced list.
2. **Comparison**: The comparison `if q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]:` can involve invalid types or values that cannot be compared.

#### What the Try Except Statement Accomplishes
- The `try` block checks if the condition `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` holds true.
- If the condition is met, `z` is incremented by `q1 - to - 1`.
- If the condition is not met, `z` is incremented by `q1 - to`.
- The `except` block catches any exceptions that occur during the execution of the `try` block and ensures that `z` is incremented by `q1 - to` regardless of whether an exception occurs.

#### Program Output State After Execution
- `j` remains 6.
- `l` remains `[p[i], r[6]]`.
- `to` remains a value determined by the position of `l[1]` in `q`.
- `len(r)` remains the same as before.
- `isTrue` remains the index returned by `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * r[6] - p[i])`.
- `z` is updated based on whether the condition in the `try` block is met or an exception occurs. If the condition is met, `z` is incremented by `q1 - to - 1`. If an exception occurs or the condition is not met, `z` is incremented by `q1 - to`.

### Summary
Output State: **`j` is 6, `l` is `[p[i], r[6]]`, `to` is a value determined by the position of `l[1]` in `q`, `len(r)` is the same as before, `isTrue` is the index returned by `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * r[6] - p[i])`, and `z` is either its previous value plus `q1 - to - 1` if the condition `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` is true, or its original value plus `q1 - to` if an exception occurs or the condition is false.**
