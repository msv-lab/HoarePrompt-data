`isTrue` is assigned the value of `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`. Here, `l` is sorted([`p[i]`, `r[j]`]), so `l[0]` is the first element in the sorted list and `l[1]` is the second element. The value of `to` is `bisect.bisect_left(q, r[j])`.

Therefore, `isTrue` is calculated as `bisect.bisect_left(q[bisect.bisect_left(q, r[j]):], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`.

Output State: **`z` is the count of valid triplets, `p1` is the length of list `p`, `q1` is the length of list `q`, `r1` is the length of list `r`, `j` is incremented by 1, `l` is sorted([`p[i]`, `r[j]`]), `to` is bisect.bisect_left(`q`, `r[j]`), `isTrue` is bisect.bisect_left(`q[bisect.bisect_left(`q`, `r[j]`):], 2 * `l[1]` - `l[0]`)**
