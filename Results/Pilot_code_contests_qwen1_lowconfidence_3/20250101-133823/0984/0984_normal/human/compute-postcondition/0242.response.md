Output State: **`z` is the count of valid triplets `(i, j, k)` such that `s[p[i]] = 'R'`, `s[q[j]] = 'G'`, `s[r[k]] = 'B'`, and `j < k` and there exists an index `m` such that `s[m] = 'G'` and `p[i] < m < r[k]` and `q[j]` is the closest 'G' between `m` and `r[k]`. `p1` is the length of list `p`. `q1` is the length of list `q`. `r1` is the length of list `r`. `p` is a list of all indices where the character 'R' appears in the string `s`. `q` is a list of all indices where the character 'G' appears in the string `s`. `r` is a list of all indices where the character 'B' appears in the string `s`. `i` is -1 or within the bounds of list `p`. `j` is the last processed index in `r`.**
