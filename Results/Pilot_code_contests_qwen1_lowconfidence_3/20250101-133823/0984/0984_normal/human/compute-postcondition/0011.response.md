Let's go through the process step by step:

1. The initial state includes:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\)
   - `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'
   - `d` is a dictionary containing keys `i` (where `i` is each unique character in `s`) mapped to an empty list `[]`

2. The code snippet `d[s[i]].append(i)` means that for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`:
   - The character at index `i` in the string `s` is used as a key in the dictionary `d`.
   - The value associated with that key (which is an empty list) gets appended with the index `i`.

Since the code iterates over each character in the string `s` and appends the index of each character to the corresponding list in the dictionary `d`, the final state of `d` will contain the indices of each character in the string `s`. Specifically:
- Each key in `d` will be one of the characters 'R', 'G', or 'B'.
- The value associated with each key will be a list of indices where that character appears in the string `s`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\); `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a character in `s` ('R', 'G', or 'B') and the value is a list of indices where that character appears in `s`.**
