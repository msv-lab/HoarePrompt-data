The `bisect.bisect_left` function returns the index where the value `l[1]` would be inserted in the list `p` to maintain sorted order. However, the value of `p` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact index returned by `bisect.bisect_left`. We know that `l` is a sorted list containing elements from `q` and `r`, and `to` is assigned the result of this function call.

Since the exact content of `p` is not given, the only change is the assignment to `to`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`l` is a sorted list containing `q[i]` and `r[j]`, `q` is `[a, b, c]`, `r` is `[d, e, f]`, `to` is the index where `l[1]` would be inserted in `p` to maintain sorted order.**
