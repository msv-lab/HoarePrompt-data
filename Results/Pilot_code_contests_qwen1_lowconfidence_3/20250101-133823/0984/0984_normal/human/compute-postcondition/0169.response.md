### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Initial State
- `r` is a non-empty list.
- `j` is 1.
- `l` is the sorted values of `q[i]` and `r[0]`.
- `to` is the index in list `p` where the value `l[1]` would be inserted to keep the list sorted.
- `isTrue` is the index returned by `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`.
- `z` is some initial value.

#### Code for the Try Except Block
```python
try:
    if p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]:
        z += p1 - to - 1
    else:
        z += p1 - to
except:
    z += p1 - to
```

#### Points Where Exceptions Could Occur
- The exception can occur if `p[to:][isTrue]` causes an issue, such as:
  - `isTrue` is out of bounds (i.e., `isTrue` is greater than or equal to the length of `p[to:]`).

#### Summary of the Try Except Statement
- The `try` block checks if the element at `p[to:][isTrue]` equals `2 * l[1] - l[0]`.
  - If it matches, `z` is incremented by `p1 - to - 1`.
  - If it doesn't match, `z` is incremented by `p1 - to`.
- If any exception occurs during the evaluation of `p[to:][isTrue]`, the `except` block is executed, and `z` is updated to its current value plus `p1 - to`.

#### Final Output State
- `r` remains a non-empty list.
- `j` is 1.
- `l` remains the sorted values of `q[i]` and `r[0]`.
- `to` is the index in list `p` where the value `l[1]` would be inserted to keep the list sorted.
- `isTrue` is the index returned by `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`.
- `z` is updated based on the condition inside the `try` block or by adding `p1 - to` if an exception occurs.

### Output State
Output State: **`r` remains a non-empty list, `j` is 1, `l` remains the sorted values of `q[i]` and `r[0]`, `to` is the index in list `p` where the value `l[1]` would be inserted to keep the list sorted, `isTrue` is the index returned by `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, and `z` is updated to its original value plus `p1 - to - 1` if `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` holds true, otherwise it is updated to its original value plus `p1 - to`.**
