`z` is incremented by the value of `r1 - to`. The values of `r1` and `to` are not specified in the initial state, so we will keep them as they are. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p1` is greater than 0, `len(q)` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `q[j]`, `to` is the index where `l[1]` would be inserted in the sorted list `r`, `isTrue` is the index at which `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would not be inserted into the list `r[to:]` to maintain the sorted order, `z` is increased by `r1 - to`.**
