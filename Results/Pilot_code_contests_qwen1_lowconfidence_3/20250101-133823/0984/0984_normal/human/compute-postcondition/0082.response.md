Postcondition: **`z` is the count of valid pairs, `j` is `j + 2`, `i` is 0, `l` is `[p[0], q[j]] sorted`, `to` is the index of `q[j]` in list `r`, `isTrue` is the leftmost insertion point of `2 * q[j] - p[0]` in `r[to:]`. If `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to - 1`; otherwise, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to`.**
