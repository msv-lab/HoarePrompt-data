The code `to = bisect.bisect_left(r, l[1])` impacts the program by assigning the value of the index where `l[1]` would be inserted in the sorted list `r` (keeping the list sorted) to the variable `to`. The value of `l[1]` is derived from the list `l`, which contains `p[i]` and `q[j]`.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `p1`, `q`, or `r`, we cannot determine the exact value of `to`. However, we know that `to` is assigned the result of the `bisect.bisect_left` function, which returns the position where `l[1]` should be inserted.

The output state after executing this line of code is:

Output State: **`p1` is greater than 0; `len(q)` must be greater than 0; `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `q[j]`; `to` is the index where `l[1]` would be inserted in the sorted list `r`**.
