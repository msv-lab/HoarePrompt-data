The code appends the index `i` to the list corresponding to the character `s[i]` in the dictionary `d`. Since `i` is defined as `previous_i + 1`, the value of `i` is the next index in the string `s` after `previous_i`.

From the initial state, `i` is `previous_i + 1`, and the dictionary `d` contains lists of indices for each character in the string `s`. After running the code, the list for the character `s[i]` will include the new index `i`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\)
- `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a character in `s` ('R', 'G', or 'B') and the value is a list of indices where that character appears in `s`, and now includes the new index `i` for the character `s[i]`
- `i` is `previous_i + 1`

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\); `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a character in `s` ('R', 'G', or 'B') and the value is a list of indices where that character appears in `s` and includes the new index `i` for the character `s[i]`; `i` is `previous_i + 1`**
