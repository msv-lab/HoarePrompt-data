Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `p[i] > 0`
   - `len(q) > 0`
   - `l` is `[min(p[i], q[j]), max(p[i], q[j])]`
   - `to` is `bisect.bisect_left(r, l[1])`
   - `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(r[to:], 2 * max(p[i], q[j]) - min(p[i], q[j]))`
   - `z` is updated by either `z += r1 - to - 1` or `z += r1 - to` depending on the condition in the `if` statement

2. **Try Block**:
   - The `if` statement checks whether `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`.
   - If the condition is true, then `z` is updated by `z += r1 - to - 1`.
   - If the condition is false, then `z` is updated by `z += r1 - to`.

3. **Except Block**:
   - If an exception occurs during the execution of the `if` statement (i.e., an index out of range or any other exception), the `except` block is executed.
   - In the `except` block, `z` is updated by `z += r1 - to`.

### Summary of the Try-Except Block:
- The `try` block checks a specific condition and updates `z` accordingly.
- If an exception occurs (which can happen due to invalid indexing or other runtime errors), the `except` block handles the exception by updating `z` in a different way.

### Output State:
- The function will ensure that `z` is updated based on the given conditions, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.
- The exact value of `z` depends on the condition checked in the `if` statement and the handling in the `except` block.

**Output State:**
`p[i] > 0`, `len(q) > 0`, `l` is `[min(p[i], q[j]), max(p[i], q[j])]`, `to` is `bisect.bisect_left(r, l[1])`, `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(r[to:], 2 * max(p[i], q[j]) - min(p[i], q[j]))`, and `z` is updated to either `z += r1 - to - 1` or `z += r1 - to` based on the condition in the `if` statement, or `z += r1 - to` if an exception occurs.

**Output State:** **`p[i] > 0`, `len(q) > 0`, `l` is `[min(p[i], q[j]), max(p[i], q[j])]`, `to` is `bisect.bisect_left(r, l[1])`, `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(r[to:], 2 * max(p[i], q[j]) - min(p[i], q[j]))`, and `z` is updated to either `z += r1 - to - 1` or `z += r1 - to` based on the condition in the `if` statement, or `z += r1 - to` if an exception occurs.**
