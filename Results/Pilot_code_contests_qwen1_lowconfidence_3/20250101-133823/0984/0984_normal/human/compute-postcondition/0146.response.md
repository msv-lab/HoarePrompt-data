The initial state is unknown, so the specific values of `z` and `p1` and `to` are also unknown. However, the code updates the value of `z` by adding the result of `p1 - to` to its current value. Since the initial values are unknown, we can only express the updated value of `z` in terms of these unknowns.

Output State: **`z` is its original value plus (p1 - to)**
