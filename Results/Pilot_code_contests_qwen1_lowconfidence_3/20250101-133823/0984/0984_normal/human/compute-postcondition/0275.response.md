State before the loop starts: `i` is `len(p) - 1`, `p` must have at least `len(p)` elements

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop variable `j` iterates through the range of `len(r)`.
2. For the loop to execute, `r` must contain at least one element. If `r` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Given the current state where `i` is `len(p) - 1` and `p` must have at least `len(p)` elements, we need to ensure that the loop condition is met, which means `r` must have at least one element.

State: **`i` is `len(p) - 1`, `p` must have at least `len(p)` elements, `r` must have at least 1 element**
