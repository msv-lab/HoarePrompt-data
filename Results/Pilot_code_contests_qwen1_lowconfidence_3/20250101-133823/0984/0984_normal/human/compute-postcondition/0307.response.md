The function `func` accepts two parameters: `N`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, and `S`, which is a string of length N consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided output cases.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `N` and a string `S` of length `N` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: an integer `N` such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, and a string `S` of length `N` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'.**
