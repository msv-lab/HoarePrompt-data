Postcondition: ***`l` is [p[i], q[j]]; `j` is 2; `to` is the index of the first element in `r` that is greater than or equal to `q[2]`; `isTrue` is the leftmost insertion point of `2 * q[j] - p[i]` in the sublist `r[to:]`; `z` is updated based on the conditions from the previous iteration plus either `r1 - to - 1` or `r1 - to` depending on whether the if condition is met or not.***
