`z` is incremented by the value of `q1 - to`. The value of `q1` and the value of `to` are known from the initial state, so the new value of `z` can be calculated as `z + (q1 - to)`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a sorted list containing `[p[i], r[j]]`; `to` is the index where `r[j]` would be inserted into `q` to maintain the sorted order; `isTrue` is the index in the sublist `q[to:]` where `2 * r[j] - p[i]` should be inserted to keep `q[to:]` sorted; `z` is updated to `z + (q1 - to)`**
