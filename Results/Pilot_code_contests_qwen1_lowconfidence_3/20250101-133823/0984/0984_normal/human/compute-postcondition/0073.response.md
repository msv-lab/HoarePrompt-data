Postcondition: ***`z` is the count of valid pairs. If `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is incremented by `r1 - to - 1`. Otherwise, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to`. `p1` is the length of list `p`, `q1` is the length of list `q`, `r1` is the length of list `r`, `j` is `j + 1`, `i` is 0, `l` is `[p[0], q[j]] sorted`, `to` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of `l[1]` in list `r`, `isTrue` is the leftmost insertion point of `2 * l[1] - l[0]` in `r[to:]`.***
