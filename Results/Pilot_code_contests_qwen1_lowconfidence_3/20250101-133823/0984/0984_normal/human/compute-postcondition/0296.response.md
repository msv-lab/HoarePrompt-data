The given code snippet is incomplete and does not provide enough context to determine the exact values or types of `p` and `r`. However, assuming that `p` and `r` are lists, and `i` and `j` are indices, the code `l = sorted([p[i], r[j]])` sorts the elements at indices `i` and `j` from the lists `p` and `r` respectively and assigns the sorted list to `l`.

Since the initial state does not provide the specific values of `p`, `r`, `i`, and `j`, we cannot provide a specific numerical output. But we can say that `l` is a sorted list containing two elements, one from `p[i]` and one from `r[j]`.

Output State: **`l` is a sorted list containing [p[i], r[j]]**
