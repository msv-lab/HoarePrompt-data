The code `z += r1 - to` updates the value of `z` by adding the difference between `r1` and `to` to the current value of `z`. The values of `r1` and `to` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `z`. However, we know that `z` is updated by this operation.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `l` remains either `[p[i], q[j]]` sorted such that `l[0] <= l[1]`.
- `i` remains initialized properly.
- `j` remains 0.
- `to` remains the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(r, l[1])`.
- `isTrue` remains updated to the leftmost insertion point of `2 * l[1] - l[0]` in the sublist `r[to:]`.
- `r[to:][isTrue] != 2 * l[1] - l[0]` remains true.

Output State: **`l` is either `[p[i], q[j]]` sorted such that `l[0] <= l[1]`, `i` is initialized properly, `j` is 0, `to` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(r, l[1])`, `isTrue` is updated to the leftmost insertion point of `2 * l[1] - l[0]` in the sublist `r[to:]`, `r[to:][isTrue] != 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, `z` is updated by `z += r1 - to`.**
