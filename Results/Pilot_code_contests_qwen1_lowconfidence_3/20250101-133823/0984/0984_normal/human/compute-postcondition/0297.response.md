The `bisect.bisect_left` function returns the index where the value can be inserted to keep the list sorted. In this case, it inserts `l[1]` into `q` while maintaining the sorted order, and returns the index of this insertion point.

Given the initial state: `l` is a sorted list containing `[p[i], r[j]]`.

The code `to = bisect.bisect_left(q, l[1])` updates the variable `to` with the index where `l[1]` (which is `r[j]`) can be inserted in `q` to maintain the sorted order.

Since `l[1]` is `r[j]`, the output state will reflect that `to` now holds the index where `r[j]` would be inserted into `q` to keep `q` sorted.

Output State: **`l` is a sorted list containing [p[i], r[j]]; `to` is the index where `r[j]` would be inserted into `q` to maintain the sorted order.**
