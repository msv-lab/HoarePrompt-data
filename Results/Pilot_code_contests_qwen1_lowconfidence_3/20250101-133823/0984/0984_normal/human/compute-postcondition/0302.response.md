`z` is incremented by `q1 - to`. However, since the initial values of `z`, `q1`, and `to` are unknown, the only thing we can say for certain is that `z` is now equal to its original value plus `q1 - to`. Therefore, the Output State is: the state is unknown, `z` is its original value + `q1 - to`.

Output State: **the state is unknown, `z` is its original value + `q1 - to`**
