Postcondition: ***`i` is `len(p) - 1`, `p` must have at least `len(p)` elements, `r` must have at least 1 element, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`, `to` is the index in `q` where `l[1]` should be inserted to maintain sorted order, `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` should be inserted into `q[to:]` to maintain sorted order, and `z` is incremented by `q1 - to - 1` if `q[to:][isTrue]` equals `2 * l[1] - l[0]`; otherwise, `z` is increased by `q1 - to` if `q[to:][isTrue]` does not equal `2 * l[1] - l[0]`.***
