Postcondition: **`l` is a list containing [p[i], r[j]] in sorted order, `p[i]` is its first element, `r[j]` is its second element, `to` is the index of the first occurrence of `r[j]` in `q` or the insertion point where `r[j]` would maintain the sorted order; `isTrue` is the index where `2 * r[j] - p[i]` would be inserted into `q[to:]` to maintain the sorted order. If `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is incremented by `q1 - to - 1`. Otherwise, `z` is updated to `z + (q1 - to)`**.
