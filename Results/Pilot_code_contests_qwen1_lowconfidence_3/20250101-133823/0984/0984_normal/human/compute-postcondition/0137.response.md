`z` is incremented by `p1 - to`. Since the initial state is unknown, the values of `p1` and `to` are also unknown. The only change in the state is that `z` is updated to `z + (p1 - to)`. Therefore, the output state is: the state is unknown, `z` is `z + (p1 - to)`.

Output State: **the state is unknown, `z` is `z + (p1 - to)`**
