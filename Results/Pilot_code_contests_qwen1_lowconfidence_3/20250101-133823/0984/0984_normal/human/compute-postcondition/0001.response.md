`s` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`. This function reads a line from input and returns it as a string. Since `s` is assigned this input, the initial value of `n` (the length of `S`) is now the length of the string `s`. The value of `S` is no longer relevant as it is overridden by `s`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 4000`; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 4000`; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'.**
