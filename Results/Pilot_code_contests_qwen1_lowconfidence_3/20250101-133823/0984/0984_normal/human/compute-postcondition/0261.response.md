Postcondition: ***`z` is the count of valid triplets, `p1` is the length of list `p`, `q1` is the length of list `q`, `r1` is the length of list `r`, `j` is incremented by 1, `l` is sorted([`p[i]`, `r[j]`]), `to` is bisect.bisect_left(`q`, `r[j]`), `isTrue` is bisect.bisect_left(`q[bisect.bisect_left(`q`, `r[j]`):], 2 * `l[1]` - `l[0]`). If `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is incremented by `q1 - to - 1`. Otherwise, `z` is incremented by `q1 - to`.***
