Output State: **`r` remains as a non-empty list, `j` is 1, `l` remains as the sorted values of `q[i]` and `r[0]`, `to` is the index in list `p` where the value `l[1]` would be inserted to keep the list sorted, `isTrue` is the index returned by `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, and `z` is its original value plus `p1 - to - 1`.**
