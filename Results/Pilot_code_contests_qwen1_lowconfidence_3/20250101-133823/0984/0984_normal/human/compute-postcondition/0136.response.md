Postcondition: ***`z` is the count of valid pairs `[p[i], q[j]]`. If `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is incremented by `p1 - to - 1`. Otherwise, `z` is incremented by `p1 - to`. `p1` is the length of list `p`, `q1` is the length of list `q`, `r1` is the length of list `r`, `p` is a list of all indices where the character 'R' appears in the string `s`, `q` is a list of all indices where the character 'G' appears in the string `s`, `r` is a list of all indices where the character 'B' appears in the string `s`, `i` is 0, `l` is a sorted pair `[q[0], r[j]]`, `to` is the index in `p` where `r[0]` fits, `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would fit in the sublist `p[to:]`, and `j` is `j + 1`.***
