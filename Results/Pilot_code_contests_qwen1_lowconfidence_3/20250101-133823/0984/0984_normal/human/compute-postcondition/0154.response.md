Postcondition: ***`r` is a non-empty list, `j` is 0, `l` is a list containing `[min(q_i, r[0]), max(q_i, r[0])]`, `to` is the index in list `p` where the first occurrence of a value greater than or equal to `max(q_i, r[0])` is found, `isTrue` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`. The value of `p[to:][isTrue]` is equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`***
