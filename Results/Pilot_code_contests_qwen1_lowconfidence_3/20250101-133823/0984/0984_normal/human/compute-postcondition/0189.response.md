Postcondition: **`isTrue` is assigned the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`. If the element at index `isTrue` in the sublist `p[to:]` is equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is incremented by `p1 - to - 1`. Otherwise, `z` is incremented by `p1 - to`, and `l`, `q`, `r`, and `to` remain unchanged.**
