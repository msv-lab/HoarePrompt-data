The code snippet `z += p1 - to` impacts the variable `z`. It adds the result of `p1 - to` to the current value of `z`. However, the initial values of `z`, `p1`, and `to` are unknown. Therefore, we can only express the updated value of `z` in terms of these unknowns.

Output State: **`z` is its initial value plus `p1 - to`, i.e., `z` is `z + (p1 - to)`**
