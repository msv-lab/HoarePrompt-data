Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `l` is `[p[i], q[j]]`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `to` is the index of the first element in `r` that is greater than or equal to `q[2]`.
   - `isTrue` is the leftmost insertion point of `2 * q[j] - p[i]` in the sublist `r[to:]`.
   - `z` is updated based on the conditions from the previous iteration.

2. **Code for the try except block:**
   ```python
   try:
       if r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]:
           z += r1 - to - 1
       else:
           z += r1 - to
   except:
       z += r1 - to
   ```

3. **Analysis of the try block:**
   - The code checks if `r[to:][isTrue]` equals `2 * l[1] - l[0]`.
   - If the condition is true, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to - 1`.
   - If the condition is false, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to`.

4. **Exception Handling:**
   - The `except` block catches any exception that may occur during the execution of the `try` block.
   - If an exception occurs, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to`.

5. **Potential Points for Exceptions:**
   - An `IndexError` could occur if `isTrue` is out of bounds for the sublist `r[to:]`.
   - Any other exceptions (like `TypeError`) might also trigger the `except` block.

6. **Summarizing the try except statement:**
   - The `try` block updates `z` based on the condition.
   - The `except` block ensures that `z` is updated even if an exception occurs.

7. **Output State After Execution:**
   - `l` remains `[p[i], q[j]]`.
   - `j` remains 2.
   - `to` remains the index of the first element in `r` that is greater than or equal to `q[2]`.
   - `isTrue` remains the leftmost insertion point of `2 * q[j] - p[i]` in the sublist `r[to:]`.
   - `z` is updated based on the conditions from the previous iteration plus either `r1 - to - 1` or `r1 - to` depending on whether the if condition is met or not. If an exception occurs, `z` is updated by `r1 - to`.

**Output State:**
`l` is `[p[i], q[j]]`, `j` is 2, `to` is the index of the first element in `r` that is greater than or equal to `q[2]`, `isTrue` is the leftmost insertion point of `2 * q[j] - p[i]` in the sublist `r[to:]`, and `z` is updated based on the conditions from the previous iteration plus either `r1 - to - 1` or `r1 - to` depending on whether the if condition is met or not. If an exception occurs, `z` is updated by `r1 - to`.

Output State: **`l` is `[p[i], q[j]]`, `j` is 2, `to` is the index of the first element in `r` that is greater than or equal to `q[2]`, `isTrue` is the leftmost insertion point of `2 * q[j] - p[i]` in the sublist `r[to:]`, and `z` is updated based on the conditions from the previous iteration plus either `r1 - to - 1` or `r1 - to` depending on whether the if condition is met or not. If an exception occurs, `z` is updated by `r1 - to`.**
