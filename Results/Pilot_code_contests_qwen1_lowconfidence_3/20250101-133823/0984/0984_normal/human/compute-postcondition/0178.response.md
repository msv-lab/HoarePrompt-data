Let's analyze the code step by step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `r` is a non-empty list.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `l` is `[q[i], r[2]]` sorted.
   - `to` is `bisect.bisect_left(p, r[2])`.
   - `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * r[2] - q[i])`.
   - `z` remains the same.

2. **Try Block**:
   - The code checks if `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`.
   - If the condition is true, `z` is updated by adding `p1 - to - 1` to its current value.
   - If the condition is false, `z` is updated by adding `p1 - to` to its current value.

3. **Except Block**:
   - The except block catches all exceptions.
   - In the except block, `z` is updated by adding `p1 - to` to its current value.

### Points Where Exceptions Could Occur
- The only potential points where an exception could occur within the try block are:
  - `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * r[2] - q[i])`: This call to `bisect.bisect_left` could raise an exception if the slice `p[to:]` is empty or if `2 * r[2] - q[i]` is not a valid element to bisect.
  - `p[to:][isTrue]`: Accessing an element in a list slice could fail if the index is out of bounds, but given the context, it seems unlikely unless the slice is empty.

### Summary of the Try Except Statement
- The try block updates `z` based on the condition `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`.
- The except block ensures that `z` is always updated by adding `p1 - to` regardless of whether an exception is raised or not.

### Final Output State
- After executing the `try` statement, `z` is updated based on the condition within the try block.
- After executing the `except` statement, `z` is guaranteed to be updated by adding `p1 - to` if an exception occurs.

**Output State:**
`r` remains a non-empty list, `j` is 2, `l` is `[q[i], r[2]]` sorted, `to` is `bisect.bisect_left(p, r[2])`, `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * r[2] - q[i])`, `z` is updated by adding either `p1 - to - 1` or `p1 - to` to its current value depending on the condition, and if an exception occurs, `z` is updated by adding `p1 - to`.

Output State: **`r` remains a non-empty list, `j` is 2, `l` is `[q[i], r[2]]` sorted, `to` is `bisect.bisect_left(p, r[2])`, `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * r[2] - q[i])`, `z` is updated by adding either `p1 - to - 1` or `p1 - to` to its current value depending on the condition, and if an exception occurs, `z` is updated by adding `p1 - to`.**
