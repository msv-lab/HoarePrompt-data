Output State: **`z` is the count of valid triplets, `p1` is the length of list `p`, `q1` is the length of list `q`, `r1` is the length of list `r`, `j` is `len(r)`, `l` is sorted([`p[i]`, `r[len(r)-1]`]), `to` is `bisect.bisect_left(q, r[len(r)-1])`, `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(q[bisect.bisect_left(q, r[len(r)-1]):], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`. After the loop finishes, `z` will be updated according to the conditions in the `try` block and the `except` block.**

### Explanation:

1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the list `r`, where each iteration updates the variables `l`, `to`, and `isTrue`.
   - For each `j` from 0 to `len(r) - 1`, the variables are updated as follows:
     - `l` is set to `sorted([p[i], r[j]])`.
     - `to` is calculated using `bisect.bisect_left(q, r[j])`.
     - `isTrue` is calculated using `bisect.bisect_left(q[bisect.bisect_left(q, r[j]):], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`.

2. **Try Block Execution**:
   - If `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is incremented by `q1 - to - 1`.
   - Otherwise, `z` is incremented by `q1 - to`.

3. **Except Block Execution**:
   - Regardless of whether the condition in the `try` block is met, the `except` block ensures that `z` is incremented by `q1 - to`.

4. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `j` will be `len(r)`, and the final value of `z` will be the cumulative count of valid triplets based on the conditions checked in the loop.
   - The values of `p1`, `q1`, and `r1` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
   - The value of `l` will be `sorted([p[i], r[len(r)-1]])` since `j` will be `len(r) - 1` when the loop exits.
   - `to` will be `bisect.bisect_left(q, r[len(r)-1])`.
   - `isTrue` will be `bisect.bisect_left(q[bisect.bisect_left(q, r[len(r)-1]):], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`.

### Summary

- **Final Values**:
  - `z`: The count of valid triplets.
  - `p1`: Length of list `p`.
  - `q1`: Length of list `q`.
  - `r1`: Length of list `r`.
  - `j`: `len(r)`.
  - `l`: `sorted([p[i], r[len(r)-1]])`.
  - `to`: `bisect.bisect_left(q, r[len(r)-1])`.
  - `isTrue`: `bisect.bisect_left(q[bisect.bisect_left(q, r[len(r)-1]):], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`.
