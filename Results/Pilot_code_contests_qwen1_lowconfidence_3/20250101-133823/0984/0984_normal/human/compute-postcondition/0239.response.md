Postcondition: ***`j` is 6, `l` is `[p[i], r[6]]`, `to` is a value determined by the position of `l[1]` in `q`, `len(r)` is the same as before, `isTrue` is the index returned by `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * r[6] - p[i])`, and `z` is either its previous value plus `q1 - to - 1` if `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, or the original value of `z` plus `q1 - to` otherwise.***
