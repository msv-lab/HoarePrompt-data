To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the `for` loop condition and ensure they are in a state that allows the loop to start.

Given the code snippet:

```python
for j in range(len(r)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Here, the loop variable `j` ranges over the length of the list `r`. For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. The list `r` must be non-empty (i.e., `len(r)` must be greater than 0).
2. The initial value of `j` should be 0 since `range(len(r))` generates values starting from 0 up to `len(r) - 1`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **List `r` must exist and be non-empty**: The length of `r` must be greater than 0.
2. **Initial value of `j`**: The variable `j` starts from 0 when the loop begins.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `r` must be a non-empty list.
- `j` must be initialized to 0.

Final State:
**`r` is a non-empty list, `j` is 0**
