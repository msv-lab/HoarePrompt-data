`z` is updated by adding `p1 - to`. The value of `to` is the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(p, l[1])`, and `z` is updated by adding `p1 - to`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, `l` is `[q[i], r[j + 1]]` sorted, `j` is `j + 1`, `z` is updated by adding `p1 - to`.

Output State: **`isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, `l` is `[q[i], r[j + 1]]` sorted, `j` is `j + 1`, `z` is updated by adding `p1 - to`, `to` is the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(p, l[1])`**
