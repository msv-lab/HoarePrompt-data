The given code `z += r1 - to` updates the value of `z` by adding the result of `r1 - to` to its current value. Since the initial state is unknown, we cannot specify the exact values of `z`, `r1`, and `to`. However, we can describe the changes made to these variables.

Output State: **`z` is updated to its current value plus the result of `r1 - to`, `r1` holds its original value, `to` holds its original value**
