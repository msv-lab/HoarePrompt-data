Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\).
- `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'.
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a character in `s` ('R', 'G', or 'B') and the value is a list of indices where that character appears in `s`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(len(s)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the string `s`.
- The variable `i` takes values from `0` to `len(s) - 1` during each iteration.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\).
- `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'.
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a character in `s` ('R', 'G', or 'B') and the value is a list of indices where that character appears in `s`.
- After the previous iteration, `i` is equal to the index that was processed in the previous iteration.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` must be processed.
- Since the loop iterates through the indices of `s`, the next value of `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.

### Adjusted States:
- `n` remains unchanged as it is determined by the length of `s`.
- `s` remains unchanged as it is the same string throughout the loop.
- `d` remains unchanged as it is a dictionary that maps characters to their indices and does not change based on the loop counter `i`.

### Final State:
- The value of `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.
- The loop condition for the for loop `for i in range(len(s))` requires that `i < len(s)` for the loop to continue.

Given the above analysis, if `i` was `previous_i` in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\); `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a character in `s` ('R', 'G', or 'B') and the value is a list of indices where that character appears in `s`; `i` is `previous_i + 1`**.
