`l` is assigned the value of a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `q[j]`. The value of `j` is `k + 1`, and the condition `k + 1 < len(q)` ensures that `q[j]` is within the bounds of the list `q`. The variables `p` and `q` remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`j` is `k + 1`, `q` must have a length such that `k + 1 < len(q)`, `l` is a sorted list containing `[p[i], q[j]]`**
