`z` is incremented by `r1 - to`. However, since the initial values of `z`, `r1`, and `to` are unknown, the exact numerical value of `z` cannot be determined. But we know that `z` is now equal to its original value plus `r1 - to`.

Output State: **the state is unknown, `z` is its original value + `r1 - to`.**
