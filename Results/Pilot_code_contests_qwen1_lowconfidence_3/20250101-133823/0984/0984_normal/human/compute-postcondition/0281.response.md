Postcondition: **`i` is `len(p) - 1`, `p` must have at least `len(p)` elements, `r` must have at least 1 element, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`, `to` is the index in `q` where `l[1]` should be inserted to maintain sorted order, `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` should be inserted into `q[to:]` to maintain sorted order, `q[to:][isTrue]` is not equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`**
