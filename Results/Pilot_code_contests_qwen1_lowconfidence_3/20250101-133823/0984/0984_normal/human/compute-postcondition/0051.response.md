Postcondition: **`j` is `k + 1`, `q` must have a length such that `k + 1 < len(q)`, `l` is a sorted list containing `[p[i], q[j]]`, `to` is the index where `q[j]` should be inserted in `r` to maintain order, `isTrue` is the position where `2 * q[j] - p[i]` would be inserted into `r[to:]` to keep it sorted, and `z` is increased by either `r1 - to - 1` (if the condition `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` is true) or `r1 - to` (if the condition is false).**
