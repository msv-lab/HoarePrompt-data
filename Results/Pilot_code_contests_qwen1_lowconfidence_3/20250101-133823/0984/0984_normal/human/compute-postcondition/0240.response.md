`z` is incremented by the value of `q1 - to`. Since the initial values of `z`, `q1`, and `to` are unknown, the updated value of `z` will be its original value plus `q1 - to`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`z` is its original value + (q1 - to), `q1` is unchanged, `to` is unchanged**
