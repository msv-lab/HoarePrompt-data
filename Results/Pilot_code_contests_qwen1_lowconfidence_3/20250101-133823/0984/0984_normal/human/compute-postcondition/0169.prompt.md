You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for summarizing the state of the function after executing a Python `try` statement. You will be provided with the final state of the program after executing the `try` block, and the changes in the program after executing one or more `except` blocks in any situation. Please combine this information to summarize the program's state after the complete execution of the `try` statement. If there is a return always include it in the output sate. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example 1:

Initial State: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer.
Code for the try except block:
```
try:
    result = a / b
    return result
except ZeroDivisionError:
    return None
```
Ouput state after the execution of the try statement: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `result` is the result of `a` divided by `b`, and the function returns `result`.
Output state after the execution of the except statement(s): The function returns None if a ZeroDivisionError occurs.

Now, please think step by step: At which point in the program could such an exception occur? Summarise what the try except statement accomplishes and what the program output state is after it is executed.


Example Answer 1:
A `ZeroDivisionError` might be triggered at `result = a / b`. If `b` is 0, the `ZeroDivisionError` is raised, and the function returns `None`. Otherwise, the function returns the value of `a` divided by `b`. Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` are integers. If `b` is zero, the function returns `None`, otherwise, the function returns the value of `a` divided by `b`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers. If `b` is zero, the function returns `None`, otherwise the function returns the value of `a` divided by `b`.**

Example 2:

Program state after fully executing the `try` block:
Initial State: file_path is a string that's supposed to be a path to a file.

Code for the try except block:
```
def read_file(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            data = file.read()
            print("File content successfully read.")
            return data

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: The file was not found. Please check the file path.")
        return None

    except PermissionError:
        print("Error: You do not have permission to read this file.")
        return None
```
Output state after the execution of the try statement: `file_path` is a string that's supposed to be a path to a file, data is the contents of that file and the function returns that content.
Output state after the execution of the except statement(s):
Except statement 1:The function return None and prints "Error: The file was not found. Please check the file path." 
Except statement 2: The function return None and prints "Error: You do not have permission to read this file."

Now, please think step by step: At which point in the program could such an exception occur? Summarise what the try except statement accomplishes and what the program output state is after it is executed.


Example Answer 2 :
The program could raise a `FileNotFoundError` if the file is not found at the specified path or a `PermissionError` if the user does not have permission to read the file. If the file is found and the user has permission, the function reads the file content and returns it. 
Therefore: Output State: **file_path is a string that's supposed to be a path to a file. If the file is found and the user has permission, the function returns the file content, otherwise, it prints an error message and returns None.**


Your Task:

Initial State: The code `isTrue = bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])` assigns the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])` to the variable `isTrue`. The other variables are not affected.

Since `bisect.bisect_left` returns the index where the specified value can be inserted to maintain the list's sorted order, the value of `isTrue` depends on the value of `2 * l[1] - l[0]` and the sub-list `p[to:]`.

The output state is:

**`r` remains as a non-empty list, `j` is 1, `l` remains as the sorted values of `q[i]` and `r[0]`, `to` is the index in list `p` where the value `l[1]` would be inserted to keep the list sorted, `isTrue` is the index returned by `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, and `z` remains as its original value plus `p1 - to`.**
Code for the try except block:
```
try:
    if p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]:
        z += p1 - to - 1
    else:
        z += p1 - to
except:
    z += p1 - to

```
Output state after the execution of the try statement: `r` remains as a non-empty list, `j` is 1, `l` remains as the sorted values of `q[i]` and `r[0]`, `to` is the index in list `p` where the value `l[1]` would be inserted to keep the list sorted, `isTrue` is the index returned by `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, and `z` is either its original value plus `p1 - to - 1` or the original value of `z` plus `p1 - to`, depending on whether `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` holds true.
Output state after the execution of the except statement(s): 
except_1: `z` is updated to its current value plus `p1 - to`, the initial states of `p1` and `to` remain unchanged.

Now, please think step by step: At which point in the program could such an exception occur? Summarise what the try except statement accomplishes and what the program output state is after it is executed.
