Postcondition: ***`z` is the count of valid triplets, `p1` is the length of list `p`, `q1` is the length of list `q`, `r1` is the length of list `r`, `p` is a list of all indices where the character 'R' appears in the string `s`, `q` is a list of all indices where the character 'G' appears in the string `s`, `r` is a list of all indices where the character 'B' appears in the string `s`, `j` is 0, `l` is `[p[i], r[0]]`, `to` is the leftmost insertion point for `r[0]` in the list `q`, `isTrue` is the leftmost index in the sublist `q[to:]` where the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would fit. The condition `(q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0])` is true***
