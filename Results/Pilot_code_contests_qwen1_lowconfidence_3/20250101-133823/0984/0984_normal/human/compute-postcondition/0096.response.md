The code `z += r1 - to` means that `z` is updated by adding the value of `r1 - to` to its current value. However, since the initial values of `z`, `r1`, and `to` are unknown, we can only describe the change in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`z` is updated to its current value plus `r1 - to`, `r1` is unchanged, `to` is unchanged**
