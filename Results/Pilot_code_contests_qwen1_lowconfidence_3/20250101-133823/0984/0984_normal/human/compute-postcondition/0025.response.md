To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\)
- `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a character in `s` ('R', 'G', or 'B') and the value is a list of all indices where that character appears in `s`
- `p` is a list of all indices where the character 'R' appears in the string `s`
- `q` is a list of all indices where the character 'G' appears in the string `s`
- `r` is the list of all indices where the character 'B' appears in the string `s`
- `p1` is the length of the list `p`
- `q1` is the length of the list `q`
- `r1` is the length of the list `r`
- `z` is `0`
- `p1` must be greater than 0

### For Loop Analysis:
The for loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(len(q)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `j` from `0` to `len(q) - 1`.
   - Therefore, the loop will run if `len(q)` is greater than 0.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` (which is between 1 and 4000).
   - `q` is a list of indices where the character 'G' appears in `s`.
   - `p1`, `q1`, and `r1` are lengths of lists `p`, `q`, and `r` respectively.
   - `z` is `0`.
   - `p1` must be greater than 0 (as given).

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will only execute if `len(q)` is greater than 0.
   - Since `q` is a list of indices where 'G' appears, `len(q)` being greater than 0 means there is at least one index in the string `s` where the character 'G' appears.

### Required Adjustments:
- `p1` must be greater than 0 (already given).
- `len(q)` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes.

### Final State Adjustment:
- `p1` is already given to be greater than 0.
- To ensure the loop executes, `len(q)` must be greater than 0.

Thus, the final state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`p1` is greater than 0, `len(q)` must be greater than 0**
