Let's break down the given code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `r` is a non-empty list.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `l` is `[q[i], r[2]]` sorted.
   - `to` is `bisect.bisect_left(p, r[2])`.
   - `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * r[2] - q[i])`.
   - `z` remains the same.

2. The code snippet to execute is:
   ```python
   z += p1 - to
   ```

   Here, `p1` is not defined in the initial state, but since no definition for `p1` was provided, we assume it's a variable that exists and can be used in this context.

3. After executing the code, `z` is updated by adding the difference between `p1` and `to` to its current value.

4. Since no other variables are affected, the output state should include the updated value of `z`.

Output State: **`r` is a non-empty list, `j` is 2, `l` is `[q[i], r[2]]` sorted, `to` is `bisect.bisect_left(p, r[2])`, `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * r[2] - q[i])`, `z` is `z + (p1 - to)`**
