The code snippet `d[i] = []` assigns an empty list to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. The key `i` is the next character in the string `s`. Since `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'R', 'G', and 'B', `i` will be one of these characters. The initial state does not specify which exact character `i` is, but it must be one of 'R', 'G', or 'B'.

The output state after executing the code snippet will be:

- The dictionary `d` now contains the key `i` (which is one of 'R', 'G', or 'B') mapped to an empty list `[]`.
- The string `s` remains unchanged.
- The integer `n` remains unchanged.
- The variable `d` is updated as described above.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B', `d` is a dictionary containing the key `i` (where `i` is one of 'R', 'G', or 'B') mapped to an empty list `[]`, `i` is the next character in the string `s`**.
