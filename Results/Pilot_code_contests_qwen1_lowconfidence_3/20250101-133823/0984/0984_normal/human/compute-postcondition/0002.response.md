The code initializes an empty dictionary `d`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `s`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 4000`; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'; `d` is an empty dictionary**
