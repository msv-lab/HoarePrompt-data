The code `to = bisect.bisect_left(p, l[1])` impacts the program by assigning the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(p, l[1])` to the variable `to`. Here, `p` is an implicit list (not defined in the initial state), and `l[1]` is the maximum value between `q_i` and `r[0]`.

Given the initial state:
- `r` is a non-empty list.
- `j` is 0.
- `l` is a list containing `[min(q_i, r[0]), max(q_i, r[0])]`.

Let's denote `max(q_i, r[0])` as `l[1]`. The value of `to` will be the index in the list `p` where the first occurrence of a value greater than or equal to `l[1]` is found. Since the exact values of `p` and `q_i` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `to`, but we know it is determined by the position of `l[1]` in the sorted list `p`.

The output state will include the updated value of `to` and retain the unchanged values of `r`, `j`, and `l`.

Output State: **`r` is a non-empty list, `j` is 0, `l` is a list containing `[min(q_i, r[0]), max(q_i, r[0])]`, `to` is the index in list `p` where the first occurrence of a value greater than or equal to `max(q_i, r[0])` is found.**
