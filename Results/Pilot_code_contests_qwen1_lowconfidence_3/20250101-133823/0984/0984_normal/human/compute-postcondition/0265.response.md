The given code snippet does not specify what changes the variables `l` and `to` undergo, but instead updates the variable `j` and defines `l` as `sorted([p[i], r[j + 1]])`. Given this, we can deduce the following:

- The value of `j` is updated to `j + 1`.
- The list `l` is now defined as `sorted([p[i], r[j + 1]])`, where `j` has been incremented.

Since the initial state includes that `l` is defined as `sorted([p[i], r[j + 1]])`, we need to reflect the updated value of `j` in the definition of `l`.

Output State: **`j` is now `j + 1`; `l` is now `sorted([p[i], r[j + 1]])`**
