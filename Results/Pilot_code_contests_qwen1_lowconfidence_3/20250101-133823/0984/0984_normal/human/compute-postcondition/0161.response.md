Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `r` is a non-empty list.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `l` is a list containing `[min(q_i, r[0]), max(q_i, r[0])]`.
   - `to` is the index in list `p` where the first occurrence of a value greater than or equal to `max(q_i, r[0])` is found.
   - `isTrue` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`.
   - `z` is updated to its original value plus `p1 - to`.

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for j in range(len(r)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `r`. Since `j` is initially 0, the loop will increment `j` by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `0 + 1 = 1`.

4. **States to Adjust:**
   - `j` will be 1.
   - The other states (`r`, `l`, `to`, `isTrue`, and `z`) remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on these variables within the loop.

5. **Final State:**
   - `r` remains as a non-empty list.
   - `j` is now 1.
   - `l` remains as `[min(q_i, r[0]), max(q_i, r[0])]`.
   - `to` remains as the index in list `p` where the first occurrence of a value greater than or equal to `max(q_i, r[0])` is found.
   - `isTrue` remains as the result of `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`.
   - `z` remains as its original value plus `p1 - to`.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`r` is a non-empty list, `j` is 1, `l` is a list containing `[min(q_i, r[0]), max(q_i, r[0])]`, `to` is the index in list `p` where the first occurrence of a value greater than or equal to `max(q_i, r[0])` is found, `isTrue` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, `z` is updated to its original value plus `p1 - to`.**
