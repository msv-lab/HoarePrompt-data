Let's analyze the code step by step to determine where exceptions can occur and what the try-except block accomplishes.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `r` is a non-empty list.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `l` is a list containing `[min(q_i, r[0]), max(q_i, r[0])]`.
   - `to` is the index in list `p` where the first occurrence of a value greater than or equal to `max(q_i, r[0])` is found.
   - `isTrue` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`.

2. **Try Block**:
   - The condition `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` checks whether the element at the index `isTrue` in the sublist `p[to:]` is equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`.
   - If the condition is true, `z` is incremented by `p1 - to - 1`.
   - If the condition is false, `z` is incremented by `p1 - to`.

3. **Exception Handling**:
   - The `except` block catches any exception that occurs during the execution of the try block.
   - Regardless of the type of exception, `z` is updated to its original value plus `p1 - to`.

### Points Where Exceptions Can Occur

- **Index Error**: This can occur if `p[to:]` is empty or `isTrue` is out of bounds for the sublist `p[to:]`.
- **Value Error**: This can occur if `2 * l[1] - l[0]` results in a value that cannot be compared with the elements in the sublist `p[to:]`.

### Summary of What the Try-Except Statement Accomplishes

- The try block checks whether the element at the index `isTrue` in the sublist `p[to:]` is equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`.
- Depending on the result of this check, `z` is incremented by either `p1 - to - 1` or `p1 - to`.
- The except block ensures that `z` is updated to its original value plus `p1 - to` regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.

### Final Output State

- `r` is a non-empty list.
- `j` is 0.
- `l` is a list containing `[min(q_i, r[0]), max(q_i, r[0])]`.
- `to` is the index in list `p` where the first occurrence of a value greater than or equal to `max(q_i, r[0])` is found.
- `isTrue` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`.
- `z` is updated to its original value plus `p1 - to`.

### Output State

Output State: **`r` is a non-empty list, `j` is 0, `l` is a list containing `[min(q_i, r[0]), max(q_i, r[0])]`, `to` is the index in list `p` where the first occurrence of a value greater than or equal to `max(q_i, r[0])` is found, `isTrue` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, `z` is updated to its original value plus `p1 - to`.**
