Postcondition: ***`l` is a sorted list containing `[p[i], r[j]]`; `to` is the index where `r[j]` would be inserted into `q` to maintain the sorted order; `isTrue` is the index in the sublist `q[to:]` where `2 * r[j] - p[i]` should be inserted to keep `q[to:]` sorted; `z` is updated to either its original value plus `q1 - to - 1` or `z + (q1 - to)` depending on whether `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` is true or false.***
