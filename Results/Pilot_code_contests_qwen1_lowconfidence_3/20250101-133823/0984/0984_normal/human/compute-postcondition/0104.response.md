Postcondition: ***`l` is either `[p[i], q[j]]`, sorted such that `l[0] <= l[1]`, `i` is initialized properly, `j` is 1, `to` is the index of the first element in `r` that is greater than or equal to `l[1]`, `isTrue` is the leftmost insertion point of `2 * l[1] - l[0]` in the sublist `r[to:]`, and `z` is updated to its original value plus either `r1 - to - 1` or `r1 - to` depending on whether `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` holds true or not.***
