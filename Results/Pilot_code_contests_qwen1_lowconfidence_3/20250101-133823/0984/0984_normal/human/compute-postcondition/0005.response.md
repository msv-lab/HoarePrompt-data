Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\).
   - `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'.
   - `d` is a dictionary containing one key-value pair where the key is an integer `i` and the value is an empty list `[]`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in s:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - The variable `i` takes on the value of each character in `s` during each iteration.

4. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was a character from the string `s`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next character in the string `s`.

5. **New State After One More Iteration:**
   - `n` remains unchanged since it is the length of the string `s`.
   - `s` remains the same string, but `i` will now be the next character in the string.
   - The dictionary `d` remains unchanged as the loop body is omitted (assuming no modifications are made inside the loop).

Therefore, the new state after one more iteration would be:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\).
- `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'.
- `d` is a dictionary containing one key-value pair where the key is an integer `i` and the value is an empty list `[]`.
- `i` is the next character in the string `s`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B', `d` is a dictionary containing one key-value pair where the key is an integer `i` and the value is an empty list `[]`, `i` is the next character in the string `s`**.
