The code `p = d['R']` assigns to `p` the list of all indices where the character 'R' appears in the string `s`. The values of `n` and `d` remain unchanged.

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\).
- `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'.
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a character in `s` ('R', 'G', or 'B') and the value is a list of all indices where that character appears in `s`.
- `p` is now a list of all indices where the character 'R' appears in the string `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\); `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a character in `s` ('R', 'G', or 'B') and the value is a list of all indices where that character appears in `s`; `p` is a list of all indices where the character 'R' appears in the string `s`.**
