`z` is incremented by `r1 - to`. However, since the initial values of `z`, `r1`, and `to` are unknown, we cannot provide specific values for the updated state of `z`. The only change is in the value of `z`.

Output State: **`z` is increased by `r1 - to`, the initial values of `r1` and `to` remain unchanged**
