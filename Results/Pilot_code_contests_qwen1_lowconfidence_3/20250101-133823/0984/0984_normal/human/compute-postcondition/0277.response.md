`to` is assigned the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(q, l[1])`. This function returns the index in `q` where the value `l[1]` should be inserted to maintain sorted order. The values of `i`, `p`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states. 

Output State: **`i` is `len(p) - 1`, `p` must have at least `len(p)` elements, `r` must have at least 1 element, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`, `to` is the index in `q` where `l[1]` should be inserted to maintain sorted order.**
