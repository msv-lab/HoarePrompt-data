Postcondition: ***`isTrue` is updated to the position where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted in `p[to:]` to maintain a sorted order; `l` is `[q[i], r[j]]`, `q` is the same, `r` is the same, `j` is `j + 1`. In both cases, `z` is updated: if the if condition is true, `z` is updated by adding `p1 - to - 1`; if the else condition is true, `z` is updated by adding `p1 - to`. `to` remains the index where `l[1]` would be inserted in `p` while maintaining sorted order.***
