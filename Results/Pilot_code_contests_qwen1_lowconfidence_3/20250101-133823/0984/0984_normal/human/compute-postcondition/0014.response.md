Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\).
- `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'.
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a character in `s` ('R', 'G', or 'B') and the value is a list of indices where that character appears in `s`, and it includes the new index `i` for the character `s[i]`.
- `i` is `previous_i + 1`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(s)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(s) - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `previous_i + 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(s)`.

### Adjusted States:
- Since `i` is `previous_i + 1`, we need to increment `i` by 1 again for the next iteration.
- Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `previous_i + 2`.
- The dictionary `d` should include the new index `i` for the character `s[i]` as per the problem description.

### Final State:
- `n` remains the same: \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\).
- `s` remains the same: a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'.
- `d` should now include the new index `i` for the character `s[i]`.
- `i` is updated to `previous_i + 2`.

### State:
**`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\); `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a character in `s` ('R', 'G', or 'B') and the value is a list of indices where that character appears in `s`, and includes the new index `i` for the character `s[i]`; `i` is `previous_i + 2`**.
