The code `p1 = len(p)` calculates the length of the list `p` and assigns it to the variable `p1`. The length of the list `p` is the number of times the character 'R' appears in the string `s`. Since the value of `p` does not change during this operation, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\); `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a character in `s` ('R', 'G', or 'B') and the value is a list of all indices where that character appears in `s`; `p` is a list of all indices where the character 'R' appears in the string `s`; `q` is a list of all indices where the character 'G' appears in the string `s`; `r` is the list of all indices where the character 'B' appears in the string `s`; `p1` is the length of the list `p`.**
