The code appends the index `i` to the list corresponding to the character `s[i]` in the dictionary `d`. Given the initial state, `i` is updated from `previous_i + 2`. Since `previous_i` is not defined in the context, we can infer that `i` starts from 0 (as it is the first increment operation). Therefore, the initial value of `i` would be 2.

Here is the step-by-step calculation:

1. `i` is initially set to `previous_i + 2`. Since `previous_i` is not defined, we assume it starts from 0, so `i` is 2.
2. `d[s[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list corresponding to the character `s[2]` in the dictionary `d`.

Thus, the dictionary `d` will have the key `s[2]` with its value being a list that now includes the index 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\); `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a character in `s` ('R', 'G', or 'B') and the value is a list of indices where that character appears in `s`, and includes the new index 2 for the character `s[2]`; `i` is 4**
