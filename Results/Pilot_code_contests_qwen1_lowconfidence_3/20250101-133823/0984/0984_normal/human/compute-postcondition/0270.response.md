Postcondition: ***`j` is `j + 1`, `to` is the index in `q` where `l[1]` (which is `min(p[i], r[j + 1])`) would be inserted to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted in the sublist `q[to:]`, and `z` is increased by either `q1 - to - 1` or `q1 - to`, depending on whether `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` is true or false.***
