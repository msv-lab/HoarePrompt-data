Postcondition: **`r` is a non-empty list, `j` is 0, `l` is a list containing `[min(q_i, r[0]), max(q_i, r[0])]`, `to` is the index in list `p` where the first occurrence of a value greater than or equal to `max(q_i, r[0])` is found, `isTrue` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, `z` is incremented by either `p1 - to - 1` (if `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`) or `p1 - to` (if `p[to:][isTrue] != 2 * l[1] - l[0]`).**
