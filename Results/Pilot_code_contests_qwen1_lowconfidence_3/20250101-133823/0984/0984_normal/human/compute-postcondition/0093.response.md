Postcondition: `l` is either `[p[i], q[j]]` sorted such that `l[0] <= l[1]`, `i` is initialized properly, `j` is 0, `to` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(r, l[1])`, `isTrue` is updated to the leftmost insertion point of `2 * l[1] - l[0]` in the sublist `r[to:]`, and `r[to:][isTrue] != 2 * l[1] - l[0]`.
