`z` is incremented by the value of `r1 - to`. The values of `p1`, `q1`, `r1`, `j`, `i`, `l`, `to`, and `isTrue` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`z` is the count of valid pairs plus `r1 - to`, `p1` is the length of list `p`, `q1` is the length of list `q`, `r1` is the length of list `r`, `j` is `j + 1`, `i` is 0, `l` is `[p[0], q[j]] sorted`, `to` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of `l[1]` in list `r`, `isTrue` is the leftmost insertion point of `2 * l[1] - l[0]` in `r[to:]`.**
