Postcondition: ***`z` is the count of valid pairs `[p[i], q[j + 1]]`. If `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is incremented by `p1 - to - 1`. Otherwise, `z` is incremented by `p1 - to`. `i` is 0, `l` is a sorted version of `[q[i], r[j]]`, `to` is the index in `p` where `l[1]` fits, `isTrue` is the index in `p[to:]` where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` should be inserted to keep the list sorted.***
