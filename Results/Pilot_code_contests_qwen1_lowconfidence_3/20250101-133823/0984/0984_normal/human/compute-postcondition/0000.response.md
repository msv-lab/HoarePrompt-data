`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, which converts the input from the user into an integer. The initial state specifies that `N` is an integer such that `1 ≤ N ≤ 4000`. This condition ensures that the value assigned to `n` will also fall within this range.

The string `S` remains unchanged, and its length is now known to be equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 4000`, `S` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'.**
