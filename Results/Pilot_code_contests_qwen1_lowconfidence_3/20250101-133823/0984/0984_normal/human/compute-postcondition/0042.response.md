Postcondition: ***`p[i]` is greater than 0, `len(q)` is greater than 0, `l` is `[min(p[i], q[j]), max(p[i], q[j])]`, `to` is `bisect.bisect_left(r, l[1])`, `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(r[to:], 2 * max(p[i], q[j]) - min(p[i], q[j]))`, and `z` is updated by either `z += r1 - to - 1` or `z += r1 - to` depending on the condition in the `if` statement.***
