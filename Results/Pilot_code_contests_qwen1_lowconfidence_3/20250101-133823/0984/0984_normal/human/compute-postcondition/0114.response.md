The code snippet `z += r1 - to` means that `z` is updated by adding the result of `r1 - to` to its current value. However, since the initial values of `z`, `r1`, and `to` are unknown, we cannot determine the exact value of `z` after the operation. We can only say that `z` is now equal to its original value plus `r1 - to`.

Output State: **the state is unknown, `z` is its original value plus `r1 - to`.**
