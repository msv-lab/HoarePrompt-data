Output State: **`i` is `len(p) - 1`, `j` is `len(r) - 1`, `p` must have at least `len(p)` elements, `r` must have at least `len(r)` elements, `z` is the count of valid triplets `(i, j, k)` such that `s[p[i]] = 'R'`, `s[q[j]] = 'G'`, `s[r[k]] = 'B'`, and `j < k` and there exists an index `m` such that `s[m] = 'G'` and `p[i] < m < r[k]` and `q[j]` is the closest 'G' between `m` and `r[k]`.**
