### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Possible Exceptions**: 
   - The code inside the `try` block is checking if `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`. This comparison does not inherently raise exceptions, but the issue lies with the list indexing.
   - `r[to:]` is a sublist starting from the index `to` to the end of the list `r`.
   - `r[to:][isTrue]` attempts to access an element in this sublist using the index `isTrue`.
   - If `isTrue` is out of bounds (i.e., `isTrue >= len(r[to:])`), an `IndexError` would be raised.

2. **Effect of the `try` Block**:
   - If no exception is raised (i.e., the index `isTrue` is valid and the condition `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` is met), `z` is updated by `z += r1 - to - 1`.
   - If the condition is not met, `z` is updated by `z += r1 - to`.

3. **Effect of the `except` Block**:
   - The `except` block catches all types of exceptions (including `IndexError`).
   - If an exception occurs (specifically `IndexError`), `z` is updated by `z += r1 - to`, regardless of whether the condition was met or not.

4. **Summary**:
   - The `try` block checks if `r[to:][isTrue]` matches `2 * l[1] - l[0]`. If it does, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to - 1`. Otherwise, it is incremented by `r1 - to`.
   - The `except` block ensures that even if an `IndexError` is raised due to an invalid index `isTrue`, the operation `z += r1 - to` still happens, ensuring consistent behavior.

### Final Output State

**Output State:** `p1` is greater than 0, `len(q)` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `q[j]`, `to` is the index where `l[1]` would be inserted in the sorted list `r`, `isTrue` is the index at which `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted into the list `r[to:]` to maintain the sorted order. In all cases, `z` is updated by either `z += r1 - to - 1` or `z += r1 - to`, depending on whether the condition in the `if` statement is true or false.

Output State: **`p1` is greater than 0, `len(q)` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `q[j]`, `to` is the index where `l[1]` would be inserted in the sorted list `r`, `isTrue` is the index at which `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted into the list `r[to:]` to maintain the sorted order. If the condition `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` is true, then `z` is updated by `z += r1 - to - 1`. Otherwise, `z` is updated by `z += r1 - to`.**
