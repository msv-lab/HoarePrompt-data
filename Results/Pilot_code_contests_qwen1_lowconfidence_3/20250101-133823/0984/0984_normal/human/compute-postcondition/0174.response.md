The code `z += p1 - to - 1` updates the value of `z` by adding the value of `p1 - to - 1` to the current value of `z`. However, the initial state does not specify what `p1` is, and `to` is defined as `bisect.bisect_left(p, r[2])`. Since `r` is a non-empty list and `r[2]` is one of its elements, `to` will be an index in the list `p` where `r[2]` is inserted to maintain the order.

Given that the initial state does not specify the exact values of `p` or `p1`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `p1 - to - 1`. However, we can express it in terms of these variables.

The output state after the code execution is:
- `r` remains a non-empty list
- `j` is 2
- `l` is `[q[i], r[2]]` sorted (unchanged from the initial state)
- `to` is `bisect.bisect_left(p, r[2])` (unchanged from the initial state)
- `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * r[2] - q[i])` (unchanged from the initial state)
- `z` is updated by adding `p1 - to - 1` to its current value

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`r` remains a non-empty list, `j` is 2, `l` is `[q[i], r[2]]` sorted, `to` is `bisect.bisect_left(p, r[2])`, `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * r[2] - q[i])`, `z` is updated by adding `p1 - to - 1` to its current value**
