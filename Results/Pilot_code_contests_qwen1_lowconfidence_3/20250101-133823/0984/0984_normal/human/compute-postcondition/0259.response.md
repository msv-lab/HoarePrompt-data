`z` is incremented by `q1 - to - 1`. The previous values of `q1` and `to` are used in this calculation. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`z` is the count of valid triplets and equals to `z + (q1 - to - 1)`, `p1` is the length of list `p`, `q1` is the length of list `q`, `r1` is the length of list `r`, `j` is incremented by 1, `l` is sorted([`p[i]`, `r[j]`]), `to` is bisect.bisect_left(`q`, `r[j]`), `isTrue` is bisect.bisect_left(`q[bisect.bisect_left(`q`, `r[j]`):], 2 * `l[1]` - `l[0]`)**
