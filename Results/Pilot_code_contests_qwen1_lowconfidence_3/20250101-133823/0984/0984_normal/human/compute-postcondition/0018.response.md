The code `q = d['G']` assigns the list of all indices where the character 'G' appears in the string `s` to the variable `q`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, `d`, or `p`. The output state is updated only for the variable `q`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\); `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a character in `s` ('R', 'G', or 'B') and the value is a list of all indices where that character appears in `s`; `p` is a list of all indices where the character 'R' appears in the string `s`; `q` is a list of all indices where the character 'G' appears in the string `s`.**
