Let's break down the given code and analyze the possible scenarios:

### Initial State
- `l` is either `[p[i], q[j]]`, where `l[0] <= l[1]`.
- `i` is initialized properly.
- `j` is 1.
- `to` is the index of the first element in `r` that is greater than or equal to `l[1]`.
- `isTrue` is the leftmost insertion point of `2 * l[1] - l[0]` in the sublist `r[to:]`.
- `z` is updated based on conditions involving `r[to:][isTrue]`.

### Code for the Try Except Block
```python
try:
    if r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]:
        z += r1 - to - 1
    else:
        z += r1 - to
except:
    z += r1 - to
```

### Output State After Execution of the Try Statement
- `l` is either `[p[i], q[j]]`, sorted such that `l[0] <= l[1]`.
- `i` is initialized properly.
- `j` is 1.
- `to` is the index of the first element in `r` that is greater than or equal to `l[1]`.
- `isTrue` is the leftmost insertion point of `2 * l[1] - l[0]` in the sublist `r[to:]`.
- `z` is updated to its original value plus either `r1 - to - 1` or `r1 - to` depending on whether `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` holds true or not.

### Output State After Execution of the Except Statement(s)
- `z` is updated to its current value plus the result of `r1 - to`.
- `r1` holds its original value.
- `to` holds its original value.

### Analysis
- The `try` block checks whether `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`.
- If the condition is true, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to - 1`.
- If the condition is false, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to`.
- If any other exception occurs, the `except` block ensures that `z` is updated by `r1 - to`.

### Summary
The `try` block attempts to update `z` based on the condition `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`. If no exceptions occur, `z` is updated accordingly. If any exception occurs (other than the specific case checked in the `if` statement), `z` is updated by `r1 - to`.

### Final Output State
- `l` is either `[p[i], q[j]]`, sorted such that `l[0] <= l[1]`.
- `i` is initialized properly.
- `j` is 1.
- `to` is the index of the first element in `r` that is greater than or equal to `l[1]`.
- `isTrue` is the leftmost insertion point of `2 * l[1] - l[0]` in the sublist `r[to:]`.
- `z` is updated to its original value plus either `r1 - to - 1` or `r1 - to` depending on whether `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` holds true or not.
- If any exception occurs during the execution of the `try` block, `z` is updated to its current value plus `r1 - to`.

**Output State:** `l` is either `[p[i], q[j]]`, sorted such that `l[0] <= l[1]`, `i` is initialized properly, `j` is 1, `to` is the index of the first element in `r` that is greater than or equal to `l[1]`, `isTrue` is the leftmost insertion point of `2 * l[1] - l[0]` in the sublist `r[to:]`, and `z` is updated to its original value plus either `r1 - to - 1` or `r1 - to` depending on whether `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` holds true or not. If any exception occurs, `z` is updated to its current value plus `r1 - to`.
