The function `func_6` accepts a positive integer `n` which is guaranteed to be a perfect square. It calculates all divisors of `n`, ensuring that both `d` and `n/d` are included in the result list `divs` if they are distinct. The function then sorts the list of divisors and returns it. The function correctly handles the case where `n` is a perfect square, and includes 1 and `n` as divisors. Potential edge cases, such as when `n` is 1 (the smallest perfect square), are handled appropriately, as 1 is its only divisor. The function does not handle non-perfect square inputs; if `n` is not a perfect square, it may still execute but will not produce the expected output of all divisors.
