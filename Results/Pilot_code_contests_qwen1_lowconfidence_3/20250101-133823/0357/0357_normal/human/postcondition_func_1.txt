The function `func_2` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. This function does not accept any parameters and relies on standard input. It handles the case where the input string contains multiple space-separated integers. If the input string is empty or only contains spaces, the function will still process it and return an empty list. There is no error handling for non-integer inputs, which means that if the input contains anything other than digits and spaces, the program may raise a `ValueError`.
