The function `func_3()` takes no explicit parameters but requires an input string `s` from the user. It then returns a list of characters from `s`, excluding the last character. This means if the input string `s` contains at least two characters, the returned list will have one less character than the original string. If the input string `s` contains only one character, the function will still take this input but will return an empty list since removing the last character from a single-character string results in an empty list. There are no edge cases beyond these mentioned, as the code handles the removal of the last character as specified.
