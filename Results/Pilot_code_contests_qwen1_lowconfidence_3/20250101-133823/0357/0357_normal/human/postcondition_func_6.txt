The function `func_7` accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` under specific conditions and `False` otherwise. Specifically, it returns `True` if `n` is 2, 3, or if no divisors are found up to the square root of `n` when checking for divisibility by 2, 3, and numbers of the form \(6k \pm 1\). It returns `False` for all other values of `n`.
