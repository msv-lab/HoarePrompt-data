The function reads an integer input `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `d` where \(1 \leq t \leq 3000\) and \(1 \leq d \leq 10000\). The function then returns an integer input `d` for each test case. There are no explicit parameters passed to the function. Potential edge cases include when `t` is less than 1 or greater than 3000, in which case the function would read an invalid value for `t`. Similarly, if `d` is outside the range \(1 \leq d \leq 10000\), the function would read an invalid value for `d`. However, the function does not handle these edge cases; it simply returns the input `d` for each valid test case.
