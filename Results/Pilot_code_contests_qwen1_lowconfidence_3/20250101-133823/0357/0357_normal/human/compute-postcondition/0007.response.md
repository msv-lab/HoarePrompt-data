Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers.
   - `d` is the value returned by `func_1()`.
   - `i` is the first element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`.
   - `j` is `i + 2`.
   - The condition `primes[j+1] - primes[i] < d` must hold true.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `primes[j] - primes[i] < d`.

3. **Analyzing the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to continue, `primes[j] - primes[i]` must be less than `d`.
   - Given that `j` is `i + 2`, we know that `primes[j]` and `primes[i]` are the third and first elements in the range defined by the function call to `func_8`.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Can Continue:**
   - We need to ensure that `primes[j] - primes[i] < d` holds true.
   - Since `j` is fixed as `i + 2`, the only way to adjust the state is to change the values of `primes[i]` and `primes[j]` such that their difference remains less than `d`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The values of `primes[i]` and `primes[j]` must be adjusted to ensure that the difference between them is still less than `d`.
   - Additionally, since `j` is determined by `i + 2`, no other variables need adjustment.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are the values of `primes[i]` and `primes[j]` such that `primes[j] - primes[i] < d` holds true.

**State:**
**`primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers, `d` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `i` is the first element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `primes[j] - primes[i] < d` must hold true.**
