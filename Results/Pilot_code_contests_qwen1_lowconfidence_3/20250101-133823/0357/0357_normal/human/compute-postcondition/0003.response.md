Let's analyze the given program state and the `while` loop step by step.

### Given Program State:
- `primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers.
- `d` is the value returned by `func_1()`.
- `i` is the first element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`.
- `j` is the first element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)` + 1.

### While Loop:
```
while primes[j] - primes[i] < d:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers.
   - `d` is a value determined by `func_1()`.
   - `i` and `j` are determined by calling `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)` twice, with `j` being the result of the first call plus 1.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The loop continues as long as `primes[j] - primes[i] < d`.

3. **Ensuring One Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `primes[j] - primes[i] < d` must be true initially.
   - We need to adjust the values of `i` and `j` such that the difference between `primes[j]` and `primes[i]` is less than `d`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `primes` is sorted, `primes[i]` and `primes[j]` are consecutive elements (or very close to each other in the sorted list).
   - To ensure the condition holds, we need to make sure that the initial values of `i` and `j` satisfy `primes[j] - primes[i] < d`.

Given that `j` is `i + 1` (since `j` is the first element of the tuple returned by `func_8` plus 1), the initial difference `primes[j] - primes[i]` is simply the difference between two consecutive prime numbers in the list.

5. **Ensuring the Condition**:
   - If the difference between two consecutive primes is less than `d`, the loop will execute at least once.
   - However, if the difference is not less than `d`, the loop will not execute at all based on the initial values of `i` and `j`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to ensure that the initial difference between the first pair of consecutive primes in the range defined by `func_8` is less than `d`.

### Final State Adjustment:
Since the exact values of `i` and `j` are determined by the function calls, we cannot directly modify them without knowing their specific values. However, we can ensure the condition is met by stating that the initial values of `i` and `j` should be such that `primes[j] - primes[i] < d`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers, `d` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `i` and `j` are the first elements of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)` and `j` is `i + 1`, and `primes[j] - primes[i] < d` must hold true.**
