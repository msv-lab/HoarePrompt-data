Output State: **`primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers, `d` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `i` is the first element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`, `j` is the index such that `primes[j] - primes[i]` is the smallest difference that is still less than `d`, and `j` is the last index where the condition `primes[j] - primes[i] < d` holds true.**
