According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. Specifically, the condition for the loop to continue is `i * i <= n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is an integer 49 or greater.
- `i` is 13.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the condition `i * i <= n`. 

Given:
- `i` is currently 13.
- `i * i` is \(13 \times 13 = 169\).

For the loop to continue, `169` must be less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is an integer 49 or greater, the only way for `169 <= n` to be true is if `n` is at least 169.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is at least 169 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` must be at least 169**
