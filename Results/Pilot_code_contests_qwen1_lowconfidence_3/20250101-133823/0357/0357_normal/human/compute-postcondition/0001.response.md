The function `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)` is called, which returns a tuple containing two elements. The first element of the tuple is assigned to `i`. The second element of the tuple is assigned to `j`. However, the specific values of `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `i` and `j`. The value of `d` remains unchanged.

Output State: **primes is a sorted list of prime numbers, `d` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `i` is the first element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`, `j` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`**
