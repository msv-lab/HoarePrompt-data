The code snippet assigns the value returned by `func_1()` to the variable `d`. Since `func_1()` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `d`. However, we know that `d` is an integer such that `1 <= d <= 10000` as per the initial state.

Output State: **primes is a sorted list of prime numbers, d is an integer such that 1 <= d <= 10000, i and j are indices within the range of the primes list, and `d` is the value returned by `func_1()`**
