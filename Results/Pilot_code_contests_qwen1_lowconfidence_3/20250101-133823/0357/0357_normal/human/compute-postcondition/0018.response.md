The value of `i` is incremented by 6. Initially, `i` is 7, so the new value of `i` is 7 + 6 = 13. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the condition regarding `n` being divisible by 7 or 9 does not affect the output state since the code only increments `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer 49 or greater, `i` is 13**
