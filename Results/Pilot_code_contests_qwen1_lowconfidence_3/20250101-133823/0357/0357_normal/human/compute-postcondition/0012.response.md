Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and does not return anything directly. Instead, it calculates two indices `i` and `j` within a predefined sorted list of prime numbers `primes` such that the difference between `primes[j]` and `primes[i]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `d + 1`. After finding these indices, it prints the product of the primes at these indices. If `d` is such that no such pair of primes exists (e.g., `d` is too large), the function will either exit the loop without finding a suitable pair or raise an error if the loop conditions are not met properly.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `d` is larger than the difference between the largest and smallest primes in the list minus one, the function may exit the loop prematurely, leading to undefined behavior or an incorrect result.
- If `d` is exactly the difference between consecutive primes, the function will correctly identify such pairs.
