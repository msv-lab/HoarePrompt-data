Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop step by step.

### Given State:
- `n` is 1
- `i` is 7
- The condition `(n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0)` is false

### Loop Condition:
- The loop runs as long as `i * i <= n`.

### Current Values:
- Since `n` is 1, the condition `i * i <= n` simplifies to `7 * 7 <= 1`, which is `49 <= 1`, and this is false.

Since the loop condition `i * i <= n` is false with the current values of `n` and `i`, the loop will not execute in the current state.

### Adjustment Needed:
To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that the condition `i * i <= n` becomes true. 

Given that `n` is currently 1, we need to increase `n` to a value where `i * i` is greater than or equal to `n`. Since `i` is 7, we need `n` to be at least 49 (because `7 * 7 = 49`).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` should be 49 or greater.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is 49 or greater, `i` is 7**
