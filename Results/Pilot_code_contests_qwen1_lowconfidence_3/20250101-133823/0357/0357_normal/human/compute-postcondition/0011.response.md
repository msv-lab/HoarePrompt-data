The function `func_9` accepts no explicit parameters. The parameters are implied to be part of a global context, but for the purpose of describing the function's functionality, we will focus on the inputs and outputs as given.

- The function checks if `d` is an integer such that 1 <= d <= 10000.
- The function also references a sorted list of prime numbers named `primes`.
- The function uses indices `i` and `j` which are within the range of the `primes` list.

Cases:
Case_1: `d` is an integer such that 1 <= d <= 10000. The function returns the prime number from the `primes` list at index `i` if `d` is equal to `i`. 
Case_2: If `d` does not match any index `i` in the range, the function returns the prime number from the `primes` list at index `j`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_9` is to accept an integer `d` within the range 1 to 10000 and return a prime number from a predefined sorted list of prime numbers based on the index `i` or `j`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `d` within the range 1 to 10000 and returns a prime number from a predefined sorted list of prime numbers based on the index `i` or `j`.**
