The value of `i` is incremented by 6. The initial value of `i` is 1, so after the increment, `i` becomes `1 + 6 = 7`. The condition `(n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0)` remains unchanged because the code only affects `i` and does not alter `n` or the condition itself.

Output State: **`n` is 1, `i` is 7, and the condition `(n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0)` is false**
