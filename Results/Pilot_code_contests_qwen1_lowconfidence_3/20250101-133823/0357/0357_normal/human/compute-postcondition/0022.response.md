`i` is incremented by 6. The initial value of `i` is not specified directly in the initial state, but it is implied that the condition about `n` being divisible by `i` or `i + 2` will be checked again after this increment. However, since the code only increments `i` and does not affect `n` or any other variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer that is at least 169; if `n` is divisible by `i` or `i + 2`, the function returns False; otherwise, no change is made to the value of the function's output; `i` is increased by 6**
