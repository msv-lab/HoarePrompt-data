`j` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `j` is increased by 1 from its original value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition. 

Output State: **`primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers, `d` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `i` and `j` are the first elements of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`, `j` is `i + 1`, and `primes[j] - primes[i] < d` must hold true; `j` is increased by 1.**
