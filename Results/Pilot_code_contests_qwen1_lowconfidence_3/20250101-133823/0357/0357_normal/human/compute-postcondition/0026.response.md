Functionality: **The function `func_7` accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` under specific conditions and `False` otherwise. Specifically, it returns `True` if `n` is 2, 3, or if no divisors are found up to the square root of `n` when checking for divisibility by 2, 3, and numbers of the form \(6k \pm 1\). It returns `False` for all other values of `n`.**

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If `n` is 1, the function immediately returns `False`.
  - If `n` is 2 or 3, the function returns `True`.
  - For any other value of `n`, the function checks for divisibility by 2, 3, and numbers of the form \(6k \pm 1\) up to the square root of `n`. If any divisor is found, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

- **Missing Functionality:**
  - The code correctly handles the case where `n` is 2 or 3 by returning `True` directly.
  - The code correctly handles the case where `n` is even or divisible by 3 by returning `False` directly.
  - However, the code does not explicitly handle the case where `n` is 1, which should also return `False`. This is implied by the initial check but could be more explicit in the return statements.

In summary, the function accurately implements the conditions described in the postconditions, with the exception of handling the `n == 1` case being implicit rather than explicit.
