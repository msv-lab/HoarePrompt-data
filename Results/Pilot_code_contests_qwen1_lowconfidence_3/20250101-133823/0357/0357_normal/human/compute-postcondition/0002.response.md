The value of `j` is updated to be `i + 1`. Since `i` is the first element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`, and `j` is the second element of the same tuple, the value of `j` is now one more than the value of `i`. All other variables remain in their original state.

Output State: **primes is a sorted list of prime numbers, `d` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `i` is the first element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`, `j` is the first element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)` + 1**
