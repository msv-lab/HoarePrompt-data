The function `func_5` accepts two parameters: `l` and `sep`, both of which are integers. It joins the elements of list `l` (where each element is converted to a string) using the separator `sep` and prints the result. There are no return values; the function only performs printing. The function does not perform any conditional checks on the values of `l` or `sep`, and thus does not return any specific integer based on their values.
