You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Positive integer x is called divisor of positive integer y, if y is divisible by x without remainder. For example, 1 is a divisor of 7 and 3 is not divisor of 8.

We gave you an integer d and asked you to find the smallest positive integer a, such that 

  * a has at least 4 divisors; 
  * difference between any two divisors of a is at least d.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 3000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10000).

Output

For each test case print one integer a — the answer for this test case.

Example

Input


2
1
2


Output


6
15

Note

In the first test case, integer 6 have following divisors: [1, 2, 3, 6]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 1. There is no smaller integer with at least 4 divisors.

In the second test case, integer 15 have following divisors: [1, 3, 5, 15]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 2.

The answer 12 is INVALID because divisors are [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]. And the difference between, for example, divisors 2 and 3 is less than d=2.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not seem to implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program does not define `primes` anywhere, which is used in the function `func_9`. Moreover, the logic in `func_9` does not appear to correctly find the smallest integer `a` that satisfies the conditions given in the problem statement.

To illustrate, let's consider a few test cases:

1. For `d = 1`, the smallest integer with at least 4 divisors and where the difference between any two divisors is at least 1 is `6` (divisors: [1, 2, 3, 6]). The program would fail to produce this result because `primes` is not defined and the logic does not account for finding such an integer directly.

2. For `d = 2`, the smallest integer with at least 4 divisors and where the difference between any two divisors is at least 2 is `15` (divisors: [1, 3, 5, 15]). Again, the program would fail to produce this result due to the same reasons mentioned above.

Since the program lacks the necessary definitions and logic to correctly solve the problem for the given inputs, it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 9 : The function accepts no parameters and does not return anything directly. Instead, it calculates two indices `i` and `j` within a predefined sorted list of prime numbers `primes` such that the difference between `primes[j]` and `primes[i]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `d + 1`. After finding these indices, it prints the product of the primes at these indices. If `d` is such that no such pair of primes exists (e.g., `d` is too large), the function will either exit the loop without finding a suitable pair or raise an error if the loop conditions are not met properly.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
