You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Positive integer x is called divisor of positive integer y, if y is divisible by x without remainder. For example, 1 is a divisor of 7 and 3 is not divisor of 8.

We gave you an integer d and asked you to find the smallest positive integer a, such that 

  * a has at least 4 divisors; 
  * difference between any two divisors of a is at least d.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 3000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10000).

Output

For each test case print one integer a — the answer for this test case.

Example

Input


2
1
2


Output


6
15

Note

In the first test case, integer 6 have following divisors: [1, 2, 3, 6]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 1. There is no smaller integer with at least 4 divisors.

In the second test case, integer 15 have following divisors: [1, 3, 5, 15]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 2.

The answer 12 is INVALID because divisors are [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]. And the difference between, for example, divisors 2 and 3 is less than d=2.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the solution for finding the smallest positive integer \(a\) with at least 4 divisors and where the difference between any two divisors is at least \(d\). Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Smallest Integer Constraints**: The program attempts to use a precomputed list of prime numbers (`primes`) and relies on binary search to find suitable integers. However, it does not generate or compute these values dynamically based on the input \(d\).

2. **Missing Dynamic Generation of Divisors**: The program does not have a mechanism to dynamically generate integers with the required properties (at least 4 divisors and the difference between any two divisors being at least \(d\)). It directly uses a list of primes, which is insufficient to handle the dynamic generation required.

3. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation is intended to find a suitable integer from the precomputed list of primes, but it does not account for the conditions of having at least 4 divisors and the divisor difference constraint.

4. **Incomplete Functionality**: Functions like `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5` are placeholders and not utilized in the context of solving the problem. The core functionality to solve the problem is missing.

To illustrate, consider the test case:
- Input: 
  ```
  2
  1
  2
  ```

The expected output is:
- Output:
  ```
  6
  15
  ```

However, the program provided does not generate these outputs correctly. For example, when \(d = 1\), the smallest integer with at least 4 divisors and where the difference between any two divisors is at least 1 is 6, not a value that can be derived from the given functions and logic. Similarly, for \(d = 2\), the smallest integer is 15, which also cannot be derived correctly from the given structure.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for at least one potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 9 : The function accepts no parameters and does not return anything directly. Instead, it calculates two indices `i` and `j` within a predefined sorted list of prime numbers `primes` such that the difference between `primes[j]` and `primes[i]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `d + 1`. After finding these indices, it prints the product of the primes at these indices. If `d` is such that no such pair of primes exists (e.g., `d` is too large), the function will either exit the loop without finding a suitable pair or raise an error if the loop conditions are not met properly.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
