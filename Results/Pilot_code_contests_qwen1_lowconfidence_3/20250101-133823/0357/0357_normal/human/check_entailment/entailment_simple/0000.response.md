Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Function Definitions and Usages:**
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`, `func_8`, and `func_9` are defined, but their usages and implementations do not align with the problem description. For instance, `func_1` is supposed to read the number of test cases, but it is not used in the main logic of the program.
   - The main logic for finding the smallest integer `a` with at least 4 divisors and ensuring the difference between any two divisors is at least `d` is not present in the provided code.

2. **Prime Number Preprocessing:**
   - The prime number preprocessing in the form of the Sieve of Eratosthenes (`func_7`) and the use of precomputed primes (`primes`) seems unrelated to the problem at hand. The prime numbers are not utilized in the main logic for finding the smallest integer `a`.

3. **Main Logic Implementation:**
   - The main logic for solving the problem is missing. Specifically, there is no function or code snippet that iterates over possible values of `a` to find the smallest integer with at least 4 divisors and ensures the difference between any two divisors is at least `d`.
   - The provided code snippet includes a function `func_9` that uses primes and differences, but it does not implement the necessary logic to find the smallest integer `a` meeting the criteria.

### Required Solution:

To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
1. Read the number of test cases `t` using `func_1`.
2. For each test case, read the value of `d` using `func_1`.
3. Find the smallest integer `a` with at least 4 divisors such that the difference between any two divisors is at least `d`.
4. Print the result for each test case.

Here is a simplified version of how the solution could look:

```python
def find_smallest_a(d):
    a = 2 * d * (d + 1)
    while True:
        divisors = [i for i in range(1, a + 1) if a % i == 0]
        if len(divisors) >= 4:
            min_diff = min(divisors[i] - divisors[i-1] for i in range(1, len(divisors)))
            if min_diff >= d:
                return a
        a += 1

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    d = int(input())
    print(find_smallest_a(d))
```

This approach iteratively checks each integer starting from `2 * d * (d + 1)` until it finds the smallest integer `a` with at least 4 divisors and the required difference condition.
