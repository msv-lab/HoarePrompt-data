Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the solution for finding the smallest positive integer \(a\) with at least 4 divisors and where the difference between any two divisors is at least \(d\). Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Smallest Integer Constraints**: The program attempts to use a precomputed list of prime numbers (`primes`) and relies on binary search to find suitable integers. However, it does not generate or compute these values dynamically based on the input \(d\).

2. **Missing Dynamic Generation of Divisors**: The program does not have a mechanism to dynamically generate integers with the required properties (at least 4 divisors and the difference between any two divisors being at least \(d\)). It directly uses a list of primes, which is insufficient to handle the dynamic generation required.

3. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation is intended to find a suitable integer from the precomputed list of primes, but it does not account for the conditions of having at least 4 divisors and the divisor difference constraint.

4. **Incomplete Functionality**: Functions like `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5` are placeholders and not utilized in the context of solving the problem. The core functionality to solve the problem is missing.

To illustrate, consider the test case:
- Input: 
  ```
  2
  1
  2
  ```

The expected output is:
- Output:
  ```
  6
  15
  ```

However, the program provided does not generate these outputs correctly. For example, when \(d = 1\), the smallest integer with at least 4 divisors and where the difference between any two divisors is at least 1 is 6, not a value that can be derived from the given functions and logic. Similarly, for \(d = 2\), the smallest integer is 15, which also cannot be derived correctly from the given structure.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for at least one potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
