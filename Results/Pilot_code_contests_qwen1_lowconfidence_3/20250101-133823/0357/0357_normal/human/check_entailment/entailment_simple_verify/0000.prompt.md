You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Positive integer x is called divisor of positive integer y, if y is divisible by x without remainder. For example, 1 is a divisor of 7 and 3 is not divisor of 8.

We gave you an integer d and asked you to find the smallest positive integer a, such that 

  * a has at least 4 divisors; 
  * difference between any two divisors of a is at least d.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 3000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10000).

Output

For each test case print one integer a — the answer for this test case.

Example

Input


2
1
2


Output


6
15

Note

In the first test case, integer 6 have following divisors: [1, 2, 3, 6]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 1. There is no smaller integer with at least 4 divisors.

In the second test case, integer 15 have following divisors: [1, 3, 5, 15]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 2.

The answer 12 is INVALID because divisors are [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]. And the difference between, for example, divisors 2 and 3 is less than d=2.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the solution for finding the smallest positive integer \(a\) with at least 4 divisors and where the difference between any two divisors is at least \(d\). Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Smallest Integer Constraints**: The program attempts to use a precomputed list of prime numbers (`primes`) and relies on binary search to find suitable integers. However, it does not generate or compute these values dynamically based on the input \(d\).

2. **Missing Dynamic Generation of Divisors**: The program does not have a mechanism to dynamically generate integers with the required properties (at least 4 divisors and the difference between any two divisors being at least \(d\)). It directly uses a list of primes, which is insufficient to handle the dynamic generation required.

3. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation is intended to find a suitable integer from the precomputed list of primes, but it does not account for the conditions of having at least 4 divisors and the divisor difference constraint.

4. **Incomplete Functionality**: Functions like `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5` are placeholders and not utilized in the context of solving the problem. The core functionality to solve the problem is missing.

To illustrate, consider the test case:
- Input: 
  ```
  2
  1
  2
  ```

The expected output is:
- Output:
  ```
  6
  15
  ```

However, the program provided does not generate these outputs correctly. For example, when \(d = 1\), the smallest integer with at least 4 divisors and where the difference between any two divisors is at least 1 is 6, not a value that can be derived from the given functions and logic. Similarly, for \(d = 2\), the smallest integer is 15, which also cannot be derived correctly from the given structure.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for at least one potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
