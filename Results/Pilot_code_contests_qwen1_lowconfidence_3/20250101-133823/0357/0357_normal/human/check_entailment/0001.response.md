Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not seem to implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program does not define `primes` anywhere, which is used in the function `func_9`. Moreover, the logic in `func_9` does not appear to correctly find the smallest integer `a` that satisfies the conditions given in the problem statement.

To illustrate, let's consider a few test cases:

1. For `d = 1`, the smallest integer with at least 4 divisors and where the difference between any two divisors is at least 1 is `6` (divisors: [1, 2, 3, 6]). The program would fail to produce this result because `primes` is not defined and the logic does not account for finding such an integer directly.

2. For `d = 2`, the smallest integer with at least 4 divisors and where the difference between any two divisors is at least 2 is `15` (divisors: [1, 3, 5, 15]). Again, the program would fail to produce this result due to the same reasons mentioned above.

Since the program lacks the necessary definitions and logic to correctly solve the problem for the given inputs, it is incorrect.
