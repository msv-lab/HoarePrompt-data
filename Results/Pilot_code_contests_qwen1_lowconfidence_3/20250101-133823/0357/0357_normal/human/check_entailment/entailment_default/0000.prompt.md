You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Positive integer x is called divisor of positive integer y, if y is divisible by x without remainder. For example, 1 is a divisor of 7 and 3 is not divisor of 8.

We gave you an integer d and asked you to find the smallest positive integer a, such that 

  * a has at least 4 divisors; 
  * difference between any two divisors of a is at least d.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 3000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10000).

Output

For each test case print one integer a — the answer for this test case.

Example

Input


2
1
2


Output


6
15

Note

In the first test case, integer 6 have following divisors: [1, 2, 3, 6]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 1. There is no smaller integer with at least 4 divisors.

In the second test case, integer 15 have following divisors: [1, 3, 5, 15]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 2.

The answer 12 is INVALID because divisors are [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]. And the difference between, for example, divisors 2 and 3 is less than d=2.
Functions with output description for each function:
import sys

testing = len(sys.argv) == 4 and sys.argv[3] == 'myTest'
if testing:
    cmd = sys.stdout
    from time import time
    start_time = int(round(time() * 1000))
    input = open(sys.argv[1], 'r').readline
    readAll = open(sys.argv[1], 'r').read
    sys.stdout = open(sys.argv[2], 'w')
else:
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    readAll = sys.stdin.read
p = [False] * 21001
for i in xrange(1, 21001):
    p[i] = func_7(i)
primes = [i for (i, x) in enumerate(p) if x]
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in xrange(func_1()):
        func_9()
    if testing:
        sys.stdout = cmd
        print(int(round(time() * 1000)) - start_time)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function reads an integer input `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `d` where \(1 \leq t \leq 3000\) and \(1 \leq d \leq 10000\). The function then returns an integer input `d` for each test case. There are no explicit parameters passed to the function. Potential edge cases include when `t` is less than 1 or greater than 3000, in which case the function would read an invalid value for `t`. Similarly, if `d` is outside the range \(1 \leq d \leq 10000\), the function would read an invalid value for `d`. However, the function does not handle these edge cases; it simply returns the input `d` for each valid test case.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. This function does not accept any parameters and relies on standard input. It handles the case where the input string contains multiple space-separated integers. If the input string is empty or only contains spaces, the function will still process it and return an empty list. There is no error handling for non-integer inputs, which means that if the input contains anything other than digits and spaces, the program may raise a `ValueError`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3()` takes no explicit parameters but requires an input string `s` from the user. It then returns a list of characters from `s`, excluding the last character. This means if the input string `s` contains at least two characters, the returned list will have one less character than the original string. If the input string `s` contains only one character, the function will still take this input but will return an empty list since removing the last character from a single-character string results in an empty list. There are no edge cases beyond these mentioned, as the code handles the removal of the last character as specified.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    s = input()
    return s[:len(s) - 1]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4()` accepts a single parameter `s`, which is a string representing an integer followed by a newline character. It returns the string `s` without the trailing newline character. The function correctly removes the newline character from the end of the string, regardless of the content of the integer part of the string. The length of the string is at least 1 and the integer part is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(l, sep=' '):
    print(sep.join(map(str, l)))
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts two parameters: `l` and `sep`, both of which are integers. It joins the elements of list `l` (where each element is converted to a string) using the separator `sep` and prints the result. There are no return values; the function only performs printing. The function does not perform any conditional checks on the values of `l` or `sep`, and thus does not return any specific integer based on their values.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(n):
    i = 1
    sq_n = n ** 0.5
    divs = []
    while i <= sq_n:
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
            if n / i != i:
                divs.append(n / i)
        i = i + 1
    return sorted(divs)
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts a positive integer `n` which is guaranteed to be a perfect square. It calculates all divisors of `n`, ensuring that both `d` and `n/d` are included in the result list `divs` if they are distinct. The function then sorts the list of divisors and returns it. The function correctly handles the case where `n` is a perfect square, and includes 1 and `n` as divisors. Potential edge cases, such as when `n` is 1 (the smallest perfect square), are handled appropriately, as 1 is its only divisor. The function does not handle non-perfect square inputs; if `n` is not a perfect square, it may still execute but will not produce the expected output of all divisors.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` under specific conditions and `False` otherwise. Specifically, it returns `True` if `n` is 2, 3, or if no divisors are found up to the square root of `n` when checking for divisibility by 2, 3, and numbers of the form \(6k \pm 1\). It returns `False` for all other values of `n`.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(arr, x, low, high):
    if high >= low:
        mid = (high + low) // 2
        if arr[mid] == x:
            return (mid, mid)
        elif arr[mid] > x:
            return func_8(arr, x, low, mid - 1)
        else:
            return func_8(arr, x, mid + 1, high)
    else:
        return (high, low)
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` performs a binary search on a sorted list `arr` to find the integer `x`. If `x` is found, it returns the index `mid` twice. If `x` is not found, it narrows the search range by either updating the lower bound index (`low`) or the upper bound index (`high`) and calls itself recursively. If the search range is exhausted (i.e., `high < low`), it returns the values of `high` and `low`. The function covers the following cases:
- If `x` is found at the middle index, it returns `mid, mid`.
- If `x` is less than the middle element, it searches the left half by calling `func_8(arr, x, low, mid - 1)`.
- If `x` is greater than the middle element, it searches the right half by calling `func_8(arr, x, mid + 1, high)`.
- If the search range is exhausted, it returns `high, low`.

Potential edge cases include when `x` is not present in `arr`, which causes the function to continue narrowing the search range until `high < low`.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    d = func_1()
    i = func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)[1]
    j = i + 1
    while primes[j] - primes[i] < d:
        j += 1
    print(primes[i] * primes[j])
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function accepts no parameters and does not return anything directly. Instead, it calculates two indices `i` and `j` within a predefined sorted list of prime numbers `primes` such that the difference between `primes[j]` and `primes[i]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `d + 1`. After finding these indices, it prints the product of the primes at these indices. If `d` is such that no such pair of primes exists (e.g., `d` is too large), the function will either exit the loop without finding a suitable pair or raise an error if the loop conditions are not met properly.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
