Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic to find the smallest positive integer \(a\) with at least 4 divisors such that the difference between any two divisors is at least \(d\). The function `func_9` attempts to solve the problem but has several issues:

1. **Prime Differences Check**: The function `func_9` tries to find two prime numbers \(p_i\) and \(p_j\) from the `primes` list such that the difference between them is at least \(d + 1\). However, the problem does not specify that the solution must use prime numbers, and it can be shown that using prime numbers does not guarantee the smallest possible \(a\).

2. **Divisor Count**: The function does not ensure that the number \(a\) has at least 4 divisors. It simply finds the smallest gap between two primes and multiplies them, which does not guarantee that \(a\) will have at least 4 divisors.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases where the input \(d\) is such that no valid \(a\) can be found. For example, if \(d\) is very large, the function may fail to find a suitable pair of numbers.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:
- Input: \(d = 2\)

The correct output should be \(6\) because the divisors of \(6\) are \([1, 2, 3, 6]\), and the difference between any two divisors is at least \(2\).

However, the current implementation may output something like \(15\) (divisors \([1, 3, 5, 15]\)), which is not the smallest possible \(a\).

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
