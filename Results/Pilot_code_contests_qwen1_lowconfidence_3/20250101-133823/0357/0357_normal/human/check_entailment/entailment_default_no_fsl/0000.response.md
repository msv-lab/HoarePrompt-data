Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to find the smallest positive integer `a` with at least 4 divisors such that the difference between any two divisors is at least `d`. Specifically, the function `func_9` does not ensure that the chosen pair of primes will result in a number `a` with at least 4 divisors.

### Explanation of the Issue:
1. **Prime Pairs Selection**: The function `func_9` selects pairs of consecutive primes `primes[i]` and `primes[j]` such that the difference between them is the smallest value greater than or equal to `d + 1`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the product `primes[i] * primes[j]` will have at least 4 divisors.

2. **Divisor Count**: For a number to have at least 4 divisors, it must be of a form that allows for more than 3 divisors. Common forms include products of two distinct primes (e.g., \(p \times q\)), or a cube of a prime (e.g., \(p^3\)). However, the current implementation does not consider these forms.

3. **Edge Cases**: Consider `d = 2`. The smallest product of two consecutive primes is `2 * 3 = 6`, which has exactly 4 divisors: `[1, 2, 3, 6]`. This satisfies the condition. However, for larger values of `d`, the selected primes may not always result in a number with at least 4 divisors. For example, if `d = 5`, the smallest valid pair might not be consecutive primes, and the product might not have enough divisors.

### Example Where the Program Fails:
- **Input**: `d = 5`
- **Expected Output**: A number with at least 4 divisors and the difference between any two divisors being at least 5.
- **Current Output**: The program may select a pair of primes such that their product does not have enough divisors, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly handle the requirement of ensuring the resulting number has at least 4 divisors. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
