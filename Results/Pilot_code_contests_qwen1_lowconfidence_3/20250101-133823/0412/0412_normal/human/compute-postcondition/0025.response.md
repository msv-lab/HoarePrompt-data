Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
1. `n` is greater than 1.
2. There exists at least one pair `(i, j+2)` such that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+2][0] >= d`.
3. `partial_sum` is equal to its original value minus `input_list[j][1]`.
4. `j` is increased by 1.

### Loop Condition:
```
while input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop continues as long as the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` holds true.
- For the loop to continue, we need to ensure that the condition is still satisfied after adjusting the states.

#### Current Values:
- `n > 1` (This doesn't directly affect the loop condition but may influence the loop termination).
- There exists at least one pair `(i, j+2)` such that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+2][0] >= d` (This suggests that there is some pair in the list satisfying the condition, but we need to check the current pair involving `j`).
- `partial_sum` is equal to its original value minus `input_list[j][1]`.
- `j` has been incremented by 1.

To continue the loop, we need:
- `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` to be true after `j` is incremented by 1.

Since `j` has been incremented by 1, the new condition would be:
\[ \text{input\_list[i][0] - input\_list[j+1][0] >= d} \]

Given that there initially existed at least one pair `(i, j+2)` such that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+2][0] >= d`, it implies that there could be a pair `(i, j+1)` that satisfies the condition. Thus, we need to ensure that this condition is maintained.

### Adjusted States:
- We need to ensure that the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+1][0] >= d` holds true.
- `n` remains greater than 1, as it doesn't directly influence the loop continuation.
- `partial_sum` remains as its original value minus `input_list[j][1]`.
- `j` is now `j + 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, there exists at least one pair `(i, j+1)` such that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+1][0] >= d`, `partial_sum` is equal to its original value minus `input_list[j][1]`, `j` is increased by 1.**

Thus, the state should be modified to reflect the updated value of `j` and the necessary condition for the loop to continue.
