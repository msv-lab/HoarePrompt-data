`partial_sum` is decremented by `input_list[j][1]`. The value of `input_list[j][1]` is part of the list `input_list`, which is unchanged. The condition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains valid. The condition about the existence of at least one pair `(i, j)` such that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` also remains valid. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1; there exists at least one pair `(i, j)` such that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`; `partial_sum` is decreased by `input_list[j][1]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; there exists at least one pair `(i, j)` such that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`; `partial_sum` is decreased by `input_list[j][1]`**
