The code `partial_sum -= input_list[j][1]` subtracts the value of `input_list[j][1]` from `partial_sum`. According to the initial state, `partial_sum` is equal to its original value minus `input_list[j][1]`. After executing the code, this relationship changes. So, `partial_sum` is now updated to reflect this subtraction.

- `n` is greater than 1 (unchanged)
- There exists at least one pair `(i, j+1)` such that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+1][0] >= d` (unchanged)
- `partial_sum` is updated to its original value minus `input_list[j][1]` minus another `input_list[j][1]`, which simplifies to the original value of `partial_sum` minus 2 times `input_list[j][1]`.
- `j` is increased by 1 (unchanged in terms of the increment action, but its new value is not specified)

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is greater than 1; there exists at least one pair `(i, j+1)` such that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+1][0] >= d`; `partial_sum` is equal to its original value minus 2 times `input_list[j][1]`; `j` is increased by 1.**
