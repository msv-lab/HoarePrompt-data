`j` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `j` after this operation is not specified in the initial state. However, the initial state tells us that `j` is initially equal to `j + (n - 1)`. Since `j` is incremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be `(j + (n - 1)) + 1`.

The other variables (`n`, `partial_sum`, `max_factor`, `input_list`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `j` is `(j + (n - 1)) + 1`; `partial_sum` is `partial_sum + input_list[n-1][1] - input_list[j][1]`; `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum + input_list[n-1][1]`.**
