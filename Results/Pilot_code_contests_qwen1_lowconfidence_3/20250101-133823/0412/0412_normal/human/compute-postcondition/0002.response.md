`d` is reassigned to the value of `read_input[1]`. The initial value of `d` was an integer such that `d > 0`, and it is now updated to the second element in the `read_input` list. The other variables (`n` and `read_input`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is read_input[0], `d` is read_input[1], and `read_input` is a list of integers read from input excluding the first element**
