The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters directly listed in the provided code snippet. However, based on the constraints given, it seems the function should process some data related to friends, where each friend is described by two integers `mi` and `si`. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned.

Given the constraints:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), representing the number of friends.
- `d` is an integer such that \(d > 0\).
- Each friend is described by two integers `mi` and `si` where \(0 \leq mi, si \leq 10^9\).

The output is not specified in terms of returning a value but rather describes the processing context. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a list of friends, where each friend is represented by two integers `mi` and `si`, given the number of friends `n` and a positive integer `d`.

Functionality: **The function processes a list of friends, each described by two integers `mi` and `si`, given the number of friends `n` and a positive integer `d`.**
