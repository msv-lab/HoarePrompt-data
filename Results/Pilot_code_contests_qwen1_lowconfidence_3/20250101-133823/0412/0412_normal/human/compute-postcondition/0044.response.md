Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `j` is updated as `j + (n - 1)` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `partial_sum` is updated to `partial_sum + input_list[i][1]`.
   - `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and the final value of `partial_sum`.
   - `max_factor` is also updated to be the maximum between its current value and `partial_sum`.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - Since `i` was in the range from 1 to `n-1`, let's assume we are at the last iteration where `i == n-1`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to `n`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `j` is updated to `j + (n - 1)`, but since we are at the last iteration of the current `n`, `j` will be updated accordingly.
   - `partial_sum` will be updated to `partial_sum + input_list[n-1][1]` if this is the last iteration of the current `n`.
   - `max_factor` will be updated to be the maximum between its current value and `partial_sum`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `i` will be `n` because the loop increments `i` to `n` after the last iteration of `n-1`.
- `j` will be updated to `j + (n - 1)`.
- `partial_sum` will be updated based on the value of `input_list[n-1][1]`.
- `max_factor` will be updated to be the maximum between its current value and the new `partial_sum`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is updated to `j + (n - 1)`, `partial_sum` is updated to `partial_sum + input_list[n-1][1]`, and `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and the final value of `partial_sum`.**
