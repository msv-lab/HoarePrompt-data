The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. The initial conditions specify that `n` must be greater than 1 and there exists at least one pair `(i, j+1)` such that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+1][0] >= d`. The `partial_sum` is updated to its original value minus `input_list[j][1]`, but the value of `j` is increased by 1.

Since `j` was previously `j+1` (as per the condition involving `input_list`), after incrementing `j`, the new condition becomes that there exists at least one pair `(i, j+2)` such that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+2][0] >= d`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; there exists at least one pair `(i, j+2)` such that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+2][0] >= d`; `partial_sum` is equal to its original value minus `input_list[j][1]`; `j` is increased by 1.**
