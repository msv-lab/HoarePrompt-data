Let's break down the given conditions and the `while` loop statement to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `n` is greater than 1
  - `j` is increased by 1 (so `j` is now `j + 1`)
  - `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and the new value of `partial_sum`
  - The condition `input_list[2][0] - input_list[j + n - 1][0] >= d` is not affected

- **While Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  while input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.

2. **Current State:**
   - After the previous iteration, `j` has been incremented by 1, so `j` is now `j + 1`.
   - The expression `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` should still hold true for the next iteration.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` must remain true in the next iteration.
   - Since `j` has been incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j + 1][0] >= d` holds true.
   - Other variables like `n`, `max_factor`, and the condition involving `input_list[2][0] - input_list[j + n - 1][0]` do not affect the current loop condition directly.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `j` is properly incremented to `j + 1` and the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j + 1][0] >= d` holds true.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is increased to `j + 1`, and `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j + 1][0] >= d` must hold true.**
