Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `read_input` is a list of integers excluding the first element, `input_list` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(user_input[0], user_input[1])` entered by the user, and `user_input` is a map object of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times, so `n` must be a non-negative integer.
- `read_input` remains unchanged as it is only used to initialize `n`.
- `input_list` collects tuples of two integers entered by the user. After `n` iterations, `input_list` will contain exactly `n` tuples, each representing the integers entered by the user in each iteration.
- `user_input` is a map object of integers entered by the user during each iteration of the loop.

If the loop does not execute (`n` is 0), then:
- `n` is 0.
- `read_input` is still a list of integers excluding the first element.
- `input_list` is an empty list.
- `user_input` does not exist or is irrelevant as no user inputs are collected.
