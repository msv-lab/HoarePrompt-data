Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `read_input` is a list of integers excluding the first element; `input_list` is a list of tuples sorted lexicographically; `user_input` is a map object of integers entered by the user; `max_factor` is the maximum value obtained during the loop execution; `partial_sum` is the final value of the sum calculated during the loop; `j` is the last index of the tuple used in the loop.**

Explanation:
- **`n`**: This remains unchanged as the loop condition only depends on `n`, and `n` itself does not change.
- **`read_input`**: This remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`input_list`**: This remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`user_input`**: This remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`max_factor`**: This is updated in each iteration of the loop to be the maximum of its current value and `partial_sum`. After all iterations, `max_factor` will hold the maximum value of `partial_sum` encountered during the loop.
- **`partial_sum`**: This is updated in each iteration of the loop to reflect the sum based on the conditions specified in the loop. After all iterations, `partial_sum` will hold the final value calculated according to the loop logic.
- **`j`**: This is incremented within the while loop and reaches the last index of the tuple used in the loop after all iterations.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n <= 1`), then:
- **`max_factor`** remains as the initial value, which is `partial_sum` when `n == 1` and `0` when `n == 0`.
- **`partial_sum`** remains as the initial value, which is `input_list[0][1]` when `n == 1` and `0` when `n == 0`.
- **`j`** is `0` if the loop does not execute.
