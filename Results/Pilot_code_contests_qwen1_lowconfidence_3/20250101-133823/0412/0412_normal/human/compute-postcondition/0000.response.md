The code `read_input = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `read_input`. The variables `n` and `d` are not affected by this code. The output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `d` is an integer such that d > 0, and `read_input` is a list of integers read from input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `d` is an integer such that d > 0, and `read_input` is a list of integers read from input**
