`j` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `j` is set to 0, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer; `read_input` is a list of integers excluding the first element; `input_list` is a list of tuples sorted lexicographically; `user_input` is a map object of integers entered by the user; `max_factor` is the second element in `input_list[0]`; `partial_sum` is the second element in `input_list[0]`; `j` is 0.
