Let's break down the given information and the conditions under which the for loop will execute.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `read_input` is a list of integers excluding the first element.
- `input_list` is a list of tuples sorted lexicographically.
- `user_input` is a map object of integers entered by the user.
- `max_factor` is the second element in `input_list[0]`.
- `partial_sum` is the second element in `input_list[0]`.
- `j` is 0.

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Range of the For Loop**: The for loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`. This means the loop will execute if there are values in the range `[1, n-1]`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `n > 1`. If `n` is 0 or 1, the loop will not execute because the range function `range(1, n)` will produce an empty sequence.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`read_input`, `input_list`, `user_input`, `max_factor`, `partial_sum`, `j`) are not directly involved in the condition for the loop to execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

### Final State Adjustment:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1**

This ensures that the for loop will execute as intended.
