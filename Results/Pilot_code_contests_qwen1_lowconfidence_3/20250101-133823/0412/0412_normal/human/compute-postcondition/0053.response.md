`j` is incremented by 1, which affects its value. The value of `partial_sum` remains unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `partial_sum` is decreased by `input_list[j][1]`; `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`partial_sum` is decreased by `input_list[j][1]`; `j` is increased by 1**
