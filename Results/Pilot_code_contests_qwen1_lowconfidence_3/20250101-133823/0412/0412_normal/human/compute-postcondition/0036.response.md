`partial_sum` is decremented by the value of `input_list[j][1]`. The value of `n` being greater than 1 and `j` being increased to `j + 1` remain unchanged. The condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j + 1][0] >= d` also remains valid. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is increased to `j + 1`, `partial_sum` is decreased by `input_list[j][1]`, and `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j + 1][0] >= d` must hold true.**
