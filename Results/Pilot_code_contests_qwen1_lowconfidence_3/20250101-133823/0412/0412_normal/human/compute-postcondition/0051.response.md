To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop: `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.

Let's break down the given states and the loop condition:

1. **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `j` is `((j + (n - 1)) + 1) + 1`.
   - `partial_sum` is `partial_sum + input_list[n-1][1] - 2 * input_list[j][1]`.
   - `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum + input_list[n-1][1]`.
   - `input_list[i][0]` must be greater than or equal to `input_list[j][0] + d`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following must be true:
- `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` must still be greater than or equal to `d` after the current iteration.

Given the current state:
- We know `input_list[i][0]` is already greater than or equal to `input_list[j][0] + d` from the previous iteration.
- To ensure the loop continues, we need to ensure that `input_list[i][0]` remains greater than or equal to `input_list[j][0] + d` after the current iteration.

Since the loop updates `j` but does not update `i`, and the only variables directly affecting the loop condition are `i` and `j`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

We need to ensure that `j` is such that the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` still holds true. However, based on the given operations, there is no direct way to ensure this without knowing the exact values of `i` and `j`. Therefore, we can conclude that the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `j` is valid according to the given operations and conditions.

However, since the problem does not provide specific operations or constraints on `i` and `j` other than the initial condition, we can only ensure that `j` remains valid within the context of the operations performed in the loop body.

Thus, the key state adjustment needed is to ensure that `j` is valid according to the operations and conditions given.

**State:**
**`n` is greater than 1; `j` is `((j + (n - 1)) + 1) + 1`; `partial_sum` is `partial_sum + input_list[n-1][1] - 2 * input_list[j][1]`; `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum + input_list[n-1][1]`; `input_list[i][0]` must be greater than or equal to `input_list[j][0] + d`, and `j` must be such that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` still holds.**

This ensures that the loop condition remains valid for the next iteration.
