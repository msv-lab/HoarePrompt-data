`partial_sum` is incremented by `input_list[i][1]`. The value of `input_list[i][1]` is not specified in the initial state, but since the initial state mentions that `partial_sum` is updated according to the number of iterations, we know that `partial_sum` was previously updated. However, the exact value of `partial_sum` before this line of code is not specified. The value of `n` and `j` are also not specified explicitly, but their relationship is given as `j` is `j + (n - 1)`.

Given the initial conditions and the code snippet, the only direct change is to `partial_sum`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `partial_sum` has been updated by adding `input_list[i][1]` to its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is `j + (n - 1)`, `partial_sum` is updated to `partial_sum + input_list[i][1]`, and `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and the final value of `partial_sum`.**
