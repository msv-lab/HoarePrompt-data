The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Given the initial conditions, the other variables (`n`, `partial_sum`, and `input_list`) remain unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `j` and retains the original values of `n`, `partial_sum`, and the condition involving `input_list`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is increased to `j + 1`, `partial_sum` is decreased by `input_list[j][1]`, and `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j + 1][0] >= d` must hold true.**
