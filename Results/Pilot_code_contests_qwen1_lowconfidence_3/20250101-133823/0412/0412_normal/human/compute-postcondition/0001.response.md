The code assigns the first element of the `read_input` list to the variable `n`. The value of `d` remains unchanged, and the state of `read_input` is updated to refer to the remaining elements after the first one. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is read_input[0], `d` is an integer such that d > 0, and `read_input` is a list of integers read from input excluding the first element**
