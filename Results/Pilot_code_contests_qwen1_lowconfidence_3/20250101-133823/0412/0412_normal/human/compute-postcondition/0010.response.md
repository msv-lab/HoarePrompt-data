According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `read_input` is a list of integers excluding the first element.
- `input_list` is a list containing two tuples `(user_input[0], user_input[1])` and `(user_input[0], user_input[1])`.
- `user_input` is a list of integers.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` starts from 0 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 (since `n` must be greater than 1).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 2 and `n` must be greater than 2.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `read_input` remains a list of integers excluding the first element.
- `input_list` remains a list containing two tuples `(user_input[0], user_input[1])` and `(user_input[0], user_input[1])`.
- `user_input` remains a list of integers.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `read_input` is a list of integers excluding the first element; `input_list` is a list containing two tuples `(user_input[0], user_input[1])` and `(user_input[0], user_input[1])`; `user_input` is a list of integers**
