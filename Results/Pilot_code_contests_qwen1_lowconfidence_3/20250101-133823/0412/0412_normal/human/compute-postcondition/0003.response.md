The code initializes an empty list named `input_list`. This does not change the values of `n`, `d`, or `read_input`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is read_input[0], `d` is read_input[1], and `read_input` is a list of integers read from input excluding the first element; `input_list` is an empty list.**
