The code appends a tuple `(user_input[0], user_input[1])` to the `input_list`. Since `user_input` is a list of integers, `user_input[0]` and `user_input[1]` are individual integers. This means `input_list` now includes an additional tuple with these two integers.

The other variables remain unchanged: `n` must be greater than 2, `read_input` is a list of integers excluding the first element, and `input_list` now contains one more tuple than before.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `read_input` is a list of integers excluding the first element; `input_list` is a list containing three tuples; the last tuple in `input_list` is `(user_input[0], user_input[1])`**
