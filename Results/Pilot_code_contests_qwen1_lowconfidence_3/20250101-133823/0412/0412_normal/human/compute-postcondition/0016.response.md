The code assigns the value of `input_list[0][1]` to the variable `partial_sum`. This means `partial_sum` now holds the second element of the first tuple in the `input_list`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `read_input` is a list of integers excluding the first element; `input_list` is a list of tuples sorted lexicographically; `user_input` is a map object of integers entered by the user; `max_factor` is the second element in `input_list[0]`; `partial_sum` is the second element in `input_list[0]`**
