`j` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` was originally `j + 1`, so after incrementing, `j` is now `j + 2`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `j` is `j + 2`; `partial_sum` is decreased by `input_list[j][1]`; and `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j + 1][0] >= d` must still hold true.**
