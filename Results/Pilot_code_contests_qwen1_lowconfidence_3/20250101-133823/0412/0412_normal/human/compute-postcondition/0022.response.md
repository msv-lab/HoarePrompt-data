Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Condition**: The loop condition is `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - There exists at least one pair `(i, j)` such that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.
   - `partial_sum` is decreased by `input_list[j][1]`.
   - `j` is increased by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` must still be true at the start of the next iteration. 

Since we know there exists at least one pair `(i, j)` that satisfies the condition initially, we need to ensure that the next pair `(i, j+1)` also satisfies the condition. This means we need to adjust the state to ensure that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+1][0] >= d`.

Therefore, we need to update the state to reflect that `j` has increased by 1 and ensure that the new condition is met.

**Adjusted State**:
- `n` must be greater than 1 (unchanged).
- There must exist at least one pair `(i, j+1)` such that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+1][0] >= d`.
- `partial_sum` remains unchanged as it was already decreased by `input_list[j][1]` in the previous iteration.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1; there exists at least one pair `(i, j+1)` such that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+1][0] >= d`; `partial_sum` is decreased by `input_list[j][1]`**
