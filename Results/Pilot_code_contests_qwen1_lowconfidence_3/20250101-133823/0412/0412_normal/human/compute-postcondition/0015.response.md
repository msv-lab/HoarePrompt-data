`max_factor` is assigned the value of the second element in `input_list[0]`, which is a tuple. Since `input_list` is sorted lexicographically, the first tuple's second element will be the smallest value among all the second elements in the tuples. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer; `read_input` is a list of integers excluding the first element; `input_list` is a list of tuples sorted lexicographically; `user_input` is a map object of integers entered by the user; `max_factor` is the second element in `input_list[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `read_input` is a list of integers excluding the first element; `input_list` is a list of tuples sorted lexicographically; `user_input` is a map object of integers entered by the user; `max_factor` is the second element in `input_list[0]`**.
