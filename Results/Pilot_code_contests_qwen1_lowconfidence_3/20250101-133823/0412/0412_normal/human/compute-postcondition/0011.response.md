The code `user_input = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `user_input`. The initial state specifies that `user_input` is a list of integers. After executing the code, `user_input` will be updated with the new list of integers obtained from the input.

Given that `raw_input()` is used, the exact values in `user_input` depend on the user's input, but the initial conditions about `n` being greater than 2 and the other lists remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `read_input` is a list of integers excluding the first element; `input_list` is a list containing two tuples `(user_input[0], user_input[1])` and `(user_input[0], user_input[1])`; `user_input` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
