Let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to execute:

1. **Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `n` is equal to `read_input[0]`, meaning `n` is the first element of the list `read_input`.
   - `d` is equal to `read_input[1]`, meaning `d` is the second element of the list `read_input`.
   - `read_input` is a list of integers excluding the first element.
   - `input_list` is an empty list.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
   - The variable `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
   - We don't need to adjust `d` since it is not used in the loop condition.
   - The state of `input_list` is already empty, which is acceptable as the loop doesn't modify it directly.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `read_input` is a list of integers excluding the first element, `input_list` is an empty list.**
