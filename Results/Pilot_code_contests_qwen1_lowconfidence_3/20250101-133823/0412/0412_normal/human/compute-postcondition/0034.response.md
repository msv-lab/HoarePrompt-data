`j` is increased by 1. The value of `n` remains greater than 1. The condition `input_list[2][0] - input_list[j + n - 1][0] >= d` is not affected since it does not involve `j`. The value of `partial_sum` remains unchanged from its previous calculation. The value of `j` changes to `j + 1`. The value of `max_factor` remains the same as its previous maximum value since it does not depend on `j` in this step.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `j` is increased by 1; `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and the new value of `partial_sum`; the condition `input_list[2][0] - input_list[j + n - 1][0] >= d` is not affected.**
