Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Current State**: 
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `j` has been increased to `j + 1`
   - `partial_sum` has been decreased by `input_list[j][1]`
   - The condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` must hold true.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.

3. **Next Iteration Requirements**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` must still hold true.
   - Since `j` has already been incremented, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - Therefore, the condition becomes `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j + 1][0] >= d`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - We need to ensure that `j` is now `j + 1`.
   - The condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j + 1][0] >= d` must hold true.

5. **Final State**:
   - `n` is still greater than 1 (unchanged).
   - `j` is now `j + 1`.
   - `partial_sum` is still decreased by `input_list[j][1]` (but we don't need to explicitly mention this since it's part of the loop body).
   - The condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j + 1][0] >= d` must hold true for the loop to continue.

Given these considerations, the state for the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is now `j + 1`, and `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j + 1][0] >= d` must hold true**.
