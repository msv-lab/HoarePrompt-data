The code `print(max_factor)` simply prints the value of the variable `max_factor`. Since no other operations are performed on the variables, their values remain unchanged. The `max_factor` is printed, but its value in the state does not get updated within this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `read_input` is a list of integers excluding the first element; `input_list` is a list of tuples sorted lexicographically; `user_input` is a map object of integers entered by the user; `max_factor` is the maximum value obtained during the loop execution; `partial_sum` is the final value of the sum calculated during the loop; `j` is the last index of the tuple used in the loop; `max_factor` is printed.**
