Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `input_list[2][0] - input_list[j + n - 1][0] >= d`.
   - `partial_sum` is equal to its original value minus `(n - 1)` times `input_list[j][1]` plus `input_list[2][1]`.
   - `j` is increased by `n - 1`.
   - `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.

To ensure that the loop executes at least once, we need to check the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`. 

Given the initial state, let's analyze the required adjustments:

- **`n` being greater than 1:** This is already satisfied.
- **`input_list[2][0] - input_list[j + n - 1][0] >= d`:** This condition is provided as part of the initial state and doesn't directly affect the loop's first iteration. We need to focus on the loop condition itself.
- **`partial_sum` and `j`:** These values are updated within the loop and don't directly affect the loop's first iteration based on the given conditions.
- **`max_factor`:** This value is updated within the loop and doesn't directly affect the loop's first iteration based on the given conditions.

The critical factor for the loop to execute at least once is the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`. Since this condition is not directly influenced by the provided initial states but rather by the values in `input_list`, we need to ensure that this condition holds true when the loop starts.

Given the initial state, the loop will start with the current values of `i` and `j`. For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` must hold true.

Since the problem doesn't provide specific values for `i` and `j`, we can assume that the loop will start with valid indices such that the condition holds. Therefore, no additional state adjustments are necessary beyond ensuring the loop condition is met initially.

**Conclusion:**

State: **`n` is greater than 1; `input_list[2][0] - input_list[j + n - 1][0] >= d`; `partial_sum` is equal to its original value minus `(n - 1)` times `input_list[j][1]` plus `input_list[2][1]`; `j` is increased by `n - 1`; `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum`; and the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` must hold true initially.**
