Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is `j + (n - 1)`, `partial_sum` is updated according to the number of iterations, and `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and the final value of `partial_sum`. The condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j + n - 1][0] >= d` must initially hold true for the loop to execute at least once.**
