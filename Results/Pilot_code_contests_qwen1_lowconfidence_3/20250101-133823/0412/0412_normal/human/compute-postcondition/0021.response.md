`j` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `j` is now `j + 1`. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; there exists at least one pair `(i, j)` such that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`; `partial_sum` is decreased by `input_list[j][1]`; `j` is increased by 1**
