Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `j` is updated to `j + (n - 1)`.
   - `partial_sum` is updated to `partial_sum + input_list[n-1][1]`.
   - `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and the final value of `partial_sum`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   ```python
   while input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop continues as long as `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that the initial values of `i` and `j` satisfy this condition.

4. **Current State:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `j` is updated to `j + (n - 1)`.
   - `partial_sum` is updated to `partial_sum + input_list[n-1][1]`.
   - `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and the final value of `partial_sum`.

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `n` is already greater than 1, we don't need to adjust this.
   - We need to ensure that the initial values of `i` and `j` allow the loop to execute at least once.
   - Specifically, we need to make sure that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` initially.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The initial values of `i` and `j` need to be such that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` holds true.
   - Without knowing the exact values of `i` and `j`, we cannot specify them explicitly, but we can say that they need to be initialized in a way that satisfies the condition.

Given this analysis, the modified state before the loop should ensure that the loop condition is met initially. However, since we don't have specific values for `i` and `j`, we can only describe the condition that needs to be satisfied.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is updated to `j + (n - 1)`, `partial_sum` is updated to `partial_sum + input_list[n-1][1]`, and `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and the final value of `partial_sum`, and the initial values of `i` and `j` must be such that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`**.
