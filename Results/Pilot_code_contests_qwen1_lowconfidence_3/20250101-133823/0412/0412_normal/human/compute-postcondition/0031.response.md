According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `n` is greater than 1.
- `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j + n - 1][0] >= d` must hold true.
- `partial_sum` is equal to its original value minus `(n - 1)` times `input_list[j][1]` plus `input_list[i][1]`.
- `j` is increased by `n - 1`.
- `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` starts from 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be 2 if it was 1 in the previous iteration.

Given that `n` is greater than 1, let's assume `i` was 1 in the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `i` will become 2. Therefore, `i` will be 2, and `j` will be increased by `n - 1` (which is `n - 1` since `i` was 1).

State: **`n` is greater than 1; `input_list[2][0] - input_list[j + n - 1][0] >= d`; `partial_sum` is equal to its original value minus `(n - 1)` times `input_list[j][1]` plus `input_list[2][1]`; `j` is increased by `n - 1`; `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum`**.
