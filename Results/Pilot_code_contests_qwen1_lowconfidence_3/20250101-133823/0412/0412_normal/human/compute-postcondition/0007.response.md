According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `read_input` is a list of integers excluding the first element.
- `input_list` is a list containing one tuple `(user_input[0], user_input[1])`.
- `user_input` is a map object of integers entered by the user.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1, assuming it started from 0. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `n` must be greater than 1 (since `i` is incremented and starts from 0, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again).
- `read_input` remains a list of integers excluding the first element.
- `input_list` remains a list containing one tuple `(user_input[0], user_input[1])`.
- `user_input` remains a map object of integers entered by the user.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `read_input` is a list of integers excluding the first element, `input_list` is a list containing one tuple (user_input[0], user_input[1]), `user_input` is a map object of integers entered by the user**
