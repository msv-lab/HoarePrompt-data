Functionality: **The function processes a list of friends, each described by two integers \( m_i \) and \( s_i \), along with the number of friends \( n \) and a positive integer \( d \). It sorts the list of friends based on \( m_i \) and then iterates through the list to find the maximum value of the partial sum \( s_i \) within a distance \( d \). Specifically, for each friend \( i \), it considers the sum of \( s \)-values starting from the current friend up to the point where the difference between the current and the previous friend's \( m \)-value is less than \( d \). The function then prints the maximum value found during this process. If no valid partial sum can be formed (i.e., all friends are too far apart), the function will still correctly identify and print the largest individual \( s_i \) value.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- If all friends are too far apart such that no valid partial sum can be formed, the function correctly identifies and prints the largest individual \( s_i \) value.
- The function assumes that the input values are valid as per the problem constraints (i.e., \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), \( d > 0 \), and \( 0 \leq m_i, s_i \leq 10^9 \)). No additional validation checks are performed for these constraints within the function.
