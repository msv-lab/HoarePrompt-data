`partial_sum` is decreased by `input_list[j][1]`. The value of `partial_sum` is decreased by the value of `input_list[j][1]`. The other preconditions remain valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; there exists at least one pair `(i, j+1)` such that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+1][0] >= d`; `partial_sum` is equal to its original value minus `input_list[j][1]`**
