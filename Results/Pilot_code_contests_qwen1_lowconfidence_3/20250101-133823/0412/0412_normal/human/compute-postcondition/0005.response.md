`user_input` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This means that the user inputs a series of space-separated integers which are converted to a map object of integers. The `raw_input()` function reads a line of input from the user, and `split()` splits this line into individual strings. These strings are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The `read_input` list is unaffected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `read_input` is a list of integers excluding the first element, `input_list` is an empty list, `user_input` is a map object of integers entered by the user**
