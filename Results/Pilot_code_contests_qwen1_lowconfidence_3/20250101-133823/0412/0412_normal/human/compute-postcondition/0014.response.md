`input_list` is sorted based on the tuples it contains. The sorting is done lexicographically, meaning it sorts the tuples based on the first element, and if they are equal, it sorts based on the second element. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Since the exact values of the elements in `input_list` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact values after sorting, but we know that `input_list` is now sorted.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `read_input` is a list of integers excluding the first element, `input_list` is a list of tuples sorted lexicographically, and `user_input` is a map object of integers entered by the user.**
