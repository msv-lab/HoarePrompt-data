Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where multiple friends can be included in the company without making any of them feel poor, but the total friendship factor can still be maximized. Specifically, the program uses a greedy approach by maintaining a single starting point (`j`) and does not consider including multiple friends in a way that might maximize the total friendship factor while still satisfying the condition that no friend feels poor.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 10
10 5
20 10
30 15
40 20
```
According to the problem description, a friend feels poor if there is someone in the company with at least 10 more units of money. In this case, the optimal solution would include all four friends because no one feels poor (the differences in money between any two friends are less than 10), and the total friendship factor would be `5 + 10 + 15 + 20 = 50`.

However, the current implementation of the program would only consider the first friend, leading to a total friendship factor of `5`, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
