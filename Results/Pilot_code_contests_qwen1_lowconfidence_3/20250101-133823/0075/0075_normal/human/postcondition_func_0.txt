The function takes an integer `a` as input within the range of 0 to 2000000000, and it calculates the sum of specific elements in the list `b` (which contains pre-defined values). It achieves this by repeatedly taking the remainder of `a` when divided by 16 and adding the corresponding value from the list `b` to the result variable `res`. The loop continues until `a` becomes 0. After the loop, the function prints the accumulated result `res`. The function handles the edge case where `a` is 0 by directly adding the first element of `b` to `res`.
