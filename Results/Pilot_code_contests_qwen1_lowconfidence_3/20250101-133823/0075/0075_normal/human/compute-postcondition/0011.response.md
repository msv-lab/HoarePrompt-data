`res` is updated by adding the value of `b[a % 16]` to its current value. The value of `a` is divided by 16. Since the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `res` are not specified, we cannot provide specific values for them. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is updated by adding the value of `b[a % 16]` to its current value; `a` is divided by 16.**
