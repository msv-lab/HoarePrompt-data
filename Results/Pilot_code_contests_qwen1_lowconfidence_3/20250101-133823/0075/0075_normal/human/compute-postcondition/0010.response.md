The code snippet `res += b[a % 16]` updates the value of `res` by adding the value of `b[a % 16]` to it. However, the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `res` are not specified in the initial state. Without these specific values, we can only state that `res` is updated by adding the value of `b[a % 16]` to its current value.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`res` is updated by adding the value of `b[a % 16]` to its current value.**
