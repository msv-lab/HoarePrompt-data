Functionality: **The function takes an integer `a` as input within the range of 0 to 2000000000, and it calculates the sum of specific elements in the list `b` (which contains pre-defined values). It achieves this by repeatedly taking the remainder of `a` when divided by 16 and adding the corresponding value from the list `b` to the result variable `res`. The loop continues until `a` becomes 0. After the loop, the function prints the accumulated result `res`. The function handles the edge case where `a` is 0 by directly adding the first element of `b` to `res`.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `a` is 0, the function correctly initializes `res` with the first element of `b` and then prints it, which is the correct behavior.
- The function assumes that `a` is within the specified range (0 to 2000000000). If `a` is outside this range, the function will still execute, but this might lead to unexpected behavior since the list `b` only contains 16 elements, and indices beyond 15 will result in incorrect access. However, given the constraint `0 ≤ a ≤ 2000000000`, the function should never encounter such an index during normal operation.**

**Missing Functionality:**
- There is no explicit handling for negative values of `a`. While the current logic of the function will still execute and produce a result, it may not be meaningful or intended for negative inputs. This could be considered a missing feature if the function is expected to handle non-positive integers differently.
