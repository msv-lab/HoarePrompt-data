`a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 2000000000; `a` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 2000000000; `a` is an input integer**
