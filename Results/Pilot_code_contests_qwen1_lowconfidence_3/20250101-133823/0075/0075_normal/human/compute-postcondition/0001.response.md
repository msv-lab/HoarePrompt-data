The code initializes a list `b` with specific values. This does not affect the values of `n` or `a`. Therefore, the only changes are in the definition of the list `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 2000000000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is a list containing the values [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0]**
