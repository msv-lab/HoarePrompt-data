Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes a single integer `a` as input, which is within the specified range (0 ≤ n ≤ 2000000000).
2. **List `b` Initialization**: The list `b` is initialized with predefined values `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0]`.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: When `a` is 0, the program directly adds the first element of `b` (which is 1) to `res`, matching the problem description.
4. **Loop Logic**: The program uses a while loop to repeatedly take the remainder of `a` when divided by 16 (`a % 16`). For each iteration, it adds the corresponding value from the list `b` to `res`. This ensures that the program processes the input `a` by breaking it down into its hexadecimal components and summing up the relevant values from `b`.
5. **Output**: After the loop completes, the program prints the final value of `res`, which is the sum of the elements in `b` indexed by the hexadecimal digits of `a`.

The program accurately performs the required operations without any additional or missing steps. Therefore, it meets the problem description for all valid inputs.
