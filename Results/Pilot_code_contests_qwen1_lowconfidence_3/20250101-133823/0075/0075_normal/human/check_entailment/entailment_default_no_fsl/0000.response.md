Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the code only works correctly for numbers up to 15, as it relies on a fixed list `b` that only contains values for indices 0 through 15. For numbers greater than 15, the behavior of the program is undefined because it uses the modulo operation with 16, which leads to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input `61441`. The correct output should be `2`, but the program will produce an incorrect result due to its limited lookup table. This demonstrates that the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
