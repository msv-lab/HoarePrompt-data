Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case when `a` is exactly 0 correctly. According to the problem description and the examples, when `n` is 0, the output should be `0`. However, the program adds `b[0]` to the result `res` when `a` is 0, which means the output will be `1` instead of `0`. This can be verified with the following test case:

Input:
```
0
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

Actual Output (from the program):
```
1
```

Since the program does not handle the case when `n` is 0 correctly, the correctness is **False**.
