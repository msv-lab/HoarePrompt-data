Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where a vertex has no children, which is a potential edge case. Specifically, the recursive call `func_2(neigh, n)` inside the for loop assumes that `graph[n]` is not empty. However, if `n` is a leaf node (a vertex with no children), this call will cause an index out of range error because `graph[n]` would be empty. The code annotations suggest this case should be handled, but the implementation does not include a check for it. 

To fix this, the code should include a check to ensure `graph[n]` is not empty before making the recursive call. For example:

```python
for neigh in graph[n]:
    if neigh != parent:  # Avoid calling on the parent to prevent cycles
        func_2(neigh, n)
```

This ensures that only valid neighbors are processed, preventing the index out of range error for leaf nodes.
