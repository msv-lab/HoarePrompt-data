Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code seems to attempt to solve the problem by calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) for each vertex after potentially changing one vertex's value to 0. However, there are several issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` function is defined but not used in the main logic. Instead, the code directly uses the `gcdinfo` object to store intermediate results, which is not a standard way to calculate GCDs.

2. **Logic Flaws in Updating GCDs**: The code attempts to update the GCDs and possible values that could maximize the beauty of each node. However, the logic for updating these values is flawed. For example, it does not properly handle cases where the GCD changes due to the potential change of a single node's value to 0.

3. **Incomplete Initialization and State Management**: The code lacks proper initialization of the `gcdinfo` structure and does not handle the case where the tree has only one node correctly.

4. **No Main Logic to Handle Input and Output**: The main logic to read input, process the tree, and output the results is missing.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails, consider the following input:

```
3
6 2 3
1 2
1 3
```

Expected output:
```
6 6 6
```

However, the current implementation might produce incorrect results due to the flawed logic in updating the GCDs and handling the potential change to 0.

Since the provided code does not correctly implement the required logic and does not handle all potential cases, the correctness is **False**.
