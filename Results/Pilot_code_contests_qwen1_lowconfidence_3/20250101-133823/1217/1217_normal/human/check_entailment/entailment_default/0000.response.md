Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where a vertex is the last vertex in the tree (i.e., it has no neighbors). This is mentioned in the output hints for function2. Specifically, the recursive call to `func_2` in the line `for neigh in graph[n]: func_2(neigh, n)` will cause an issue if `n` is the last vertex, as `graph[n]` will be empty, leading to an index out of range error. This is a critical edge case that the current implementation does not address, making the program incorrect according to the problem description.
