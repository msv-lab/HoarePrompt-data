Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not handle the case where a node is the last vertex in the tree (i.e., it has no neighbors). According to the output hints for function number 2, there is no explicit handling for this scenario, which could lead to potential index out of range errors. Specifically, the recursive call `func_2(neigh, n)` will cause an error if `n` is the last vertex because there will be no elements in `graph[n]`. This is a critical edge case that the code does not address, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
