You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ilya is very fond of graphs, especially trees. During his last trip to the forest Ilya found a very interesting tree rooted at vertex 1. There is an integer number written on each vertex of the tree; the number written on vertex i is equal to ai.

Ilya believes that the beauty of the vertex x is the greatest common divisor of all numbers written on the vertices on the path from the root to x, including this vertex itself. In addition, Ilya can change the number in one arbitrary vertex to 0 or leave all vertices unchanged. Now for each vertex Ilya wants to know the maximum possible beauty it can have.

For each vertex the answer must be considered independently.

The beauty of the root equals to number written on it.

Input

First line contains one integer number n — the number of vertices in tree (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105).

Next line contains n integer numbers ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 2·105).

Each of next n - 1 lines contains two integer numbers x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n, x ≠ y), which means that there is an edge (x, y) in the tree.

Output

Output n numbers separated by spaces, where i-th number equals to maximum possible beauty of vertex i.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if b == 0 else func_1(b, a % b)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. It returns `a` if `b` is equal to 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with parameters `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` (i.e., `a % b`). This process continues until `b` becomes 0, at which point the function returns the last non-zero value of `a`, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. Potential edge cases include when either `a` or `b` is 0, in which case the function still correctly returns the non-zero value. The function does not have any missing functionality as described by the annotations.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n, parent):
    if visited[n]:
        return
    visited[n] = True
    if parent != -1:
        newgcd = func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])
        gcdinfo[n].gcd = newgcd
        if newgcd < gcdinfo[parent].gcd:
            gcdinfo[n].tor1 = a[n]
            gcdinfo[n].ifr1 = gcdinfo[parent].gcd
            if gcdinfo[parent].ifr1 == 0:
                gcdinfo[n].tor2 = gcdinfo[parent].gcd
                gcdinfo[n].ifr2 = a[n]
        else:
            if gcdinfo[parent].ifr1:
                newgcd1 = func_1(gcdinfo[parent].ifr1, a[n])
            else:
                newgcd1 = 1
            if gcdinfo[parent].ifr2:
                newgcd2 = func_1(gcdinfo[parent].ifr2, a[n])
            else:
                newgcd2 = 1
            if newgcd1 > newgcd2:
                gcdinfo[n].tor1 = gcdinfo[parent].tor1
                gcdinfo[n].ifr1 = gcdinfo[parent].ifr1
            elif newgcd2 > newgcd1:

                gcdinfo[n].ifr1 = gcdinfo[parent].ifr2
    for neigh in graph[n]:
        func_2(neigh, n)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  - There is no explicit handling for the case when `n` is the last vertex in the tree (i.e., it has no neighbors). In such a case, the recursive call to `func_2` would cause an issue since there would be no elements in `graph[n]`. This should be handled to prevent potential index out of range errors.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
