#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the numbers written on the vertices of the tree.
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if b == 0 else func_1(b, a % b)
    #`The program returns 'a' if 'b' equals 0, otherwise it returns the result of the function 'func_1(b, a % b)' where 'a % b' is the remainder of 'a' divided by 'b'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. It returns `a` if `b` is equal to 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with parameters `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` (i.e., `a % b`). This process continues until `b` becomes 0, at which point the function returns the last non-zero value of `a`, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. Potential edge cases include when either `a` or `b` is 0, in which case the function still correctly returns the non-zero value. The function does not have any missing functionality as described by the annotations.

#Overall this is what the function does:- There is no explicit handling for the case when `n` is the last vertex in the tree (i.e., it has no neighbors). In such a case, the recursive call to `func_2` would cause an issue since there would be no elements in `graph[n]`. This should be handled to prevent potential index out of range errors.
