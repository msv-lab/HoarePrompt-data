n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of vertices in the tree. The list ai contains n integers such that 1 ≤ ai ≤ 2·10^5, representing the numbers written on the vertices. The input describes a tree with n vertices, where each vertex has an integer value associated with it, and n-1 edges connecting the vertices.
