The code updates `gcdinfo[n].tor2` to be equal to `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`. Based on the initial state, `gcdinfo[parent].gcd` has a specific value, which we will denote as `specific_gcd_value`.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `gcdinfo[n].tor2` is updated to `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`, which is `specific_gcd_value`.
- `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` remains 0.
- `newgcd` is less than `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `newgcd` is less than `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`; `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is `newgcd`; `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is `a[n]`; `gcdinfo[n].tor2` is `specific_gcd_value`; `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`; `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex n in the tree traversal; `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the number written on vertex i+1; `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex n in the tree traversal; `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree; `visited` is a boolean list representing whether a vertex has been visited during the traversal; `visited[n]` is True; the parent of the current vertex n is not -1; `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` is 0.

Output State: **`newgcd` is less than `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`; `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is `newgcd`; `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is `a[n]`; `gcdinfo[n].tor2` is `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`; `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`; `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex n in the tree traversal; `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the number written on vertex i+1; `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex n in the tree traversal; `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree; `visited` is a boolean list representing whether a vertex has been visited during the traversal; `visited[n]` is True; the parent of the current vertex n is not -1; `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` is 0.**
