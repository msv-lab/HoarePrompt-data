Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the number written on vertex `i+1`, `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex `n` in the tree traversal, `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a boolean list representing whether a vertex has been visited during the traversal, and `visited[n]` is `True`. If `parent != -1`, `newgcd` is assigned the value of `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])`, `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is updated to this value, `gcdinfo[n].tor1`, `gcdinfo[n].ifr1`, and `gcdinfo[n].ifr2` are updated based on the comparison of `newgcd` with `gcdinfo[parent].gcd` and the conditions specified. If `parent == -1`, no changes occur.***
