`gcdinfo[n].ifr2` is assigned the value of `a[n]`. The value of `a[n]` is known, so `gcdinfo[n].ifr2` is updated to this value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`newgcd` is less than `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`; `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is `newgcd`; `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is `a[n]`; `gcdinfo[n].tor2` is `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`; `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`; `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex n in the tree traversal; `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the number written on vertex i+1; `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex n in the tree traversal; `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree; `visited` is a boolean list representing whether a vertex has been visited during the traversal; `visited[n]` is True; the parent of the current vertex n is not -1; `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` is 0; `gcdinfo[n].ifr2` is `a[n]`.**
