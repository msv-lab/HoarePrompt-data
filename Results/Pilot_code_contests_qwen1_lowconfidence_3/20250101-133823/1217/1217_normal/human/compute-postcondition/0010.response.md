Postcondition: ***`newgcd` is func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n]), `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is newgcd, `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is a[n], `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is gcdinfo[parent].gcd, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the number written on vertex i+1, `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex n in the tree traversal, `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a boolean list representing whether a vertex has been visited during the traversal, `visited[n]` is True, the parent of the current vertex n is not -1, `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` is 0, and `newgcd` is less than gcdinfo[parent].gcd***
