The code `gcdinfo[n].ifr1 = gcdinfo[parent].ifr2` assigns the value of `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2` to `gcdinfo[n].ifr1`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows:

- `newgcd` is `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])`
- `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is updated to `newgcd`
- `gcdinfo[n].ifr2` is checked, and if it is false, `newgcd2` is set to 1, otherwise, `newgcd2` keeps its original value
- `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is `gcdinfo[parent].tor2`
- `newgcd2 > newgcd1` is true

After executing the code, the following changes occur:

- `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is now equal to `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2`

Since no other variables are directly affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`newgcd` is `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])`, `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is updated to this value, `gcdinfo[n].ifr2` is checked and if it is false, `newgcd2` is set to 1, otherwise, `newgcd2` keeps its original value, `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is `gcdinfo[parent].tor2`, `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2`, `newgcd2 > newgcd1` is true, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the number written on vertex `i+1`, `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex `n` in the tree traversal, `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a boolean list representing whether a vertex has been visited during the traversal, `visited[n]` is `True`, and the `parent` of the current vertex `n` is not `-1`.**
