To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, let's analyze the loop and the provided output states.

### Analysis of the Loop Code
The loop iterates over each neighbor of the current vertex `n` in the adjacency list `graph`. For each neighbor, the function `func_2` is called with arguments `neigh` and `n`.

### Provided Output States
- **Output State after the loop executes 1 time**: 
  - `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
  - `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the number written on vertex `i+1`.
  - `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex `n` in the tree traversal.
  - `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree (must have at least one element in `graph[n]`).
  - `visited` is a boolean list representing whether a vertex has been visited during the traversal, and `visited[n]` is `True`.
  - `a` and `parent` may have been modified by `func_2`.

- **Output State after the loop executes 2 times**:
  - `n` is updated to the next neighbor in `graph[neigh]`.
  - `a` and `parent` may have been modified by `func_2`.
  - `visited[neigh]` is `True`.

- **Output State after the loop executes 3 times**:
  - `visited[neigh]` is `False`, `n` may have been updated by `func_2`, `a` and `parent` may have been modified by `func_2`.

### Understanding the Loop Execution
1. **First Iteration**:
   - The loop starts with the current vertex `n`.
   - It calls `func_2` for each neighbor of `n`.
   - After the first iteration, `visited[neigh]` becomes `True` for the first neighbor, and `n` might be updated to the first neighbor.

2. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - The loop continues to call `func_2` for each subsequent neighbor until all neighbors of the current vertex `n` are processed.
   - Each time `func_2` is called, it updates `a` and `parent` and may update `visited` accordingly.

3. **Final State**:
   - Once all neighbors of `n` have been processed, `visited` will be `True` for all vertices reachable from the starting vertex through the tree traversal.
   - The final state of `a` and `parent` depends on the modifications made by `func_2` during the traversal.

### Conclusion
After all iterations of the loop, the following conditions hold:
- All vertices in the tree that are reachable from the starting vertex `n` will have their `visited` status set to `True`.
- The `a` and `parent` lists may have been modified by `func_2` during the traversal.

### Output State
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the number written on vertex `i+1`; `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex `n` in the tree traversal; `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree (must have at least one element in `graph[n]`); `visited` is a boolean list representing whether a vertex has been visited during the traversal, and `visited` is `True` for all vertices reachable from the starting vertex `n`; `a` and `parent` may have been modified by `func_2`.**
