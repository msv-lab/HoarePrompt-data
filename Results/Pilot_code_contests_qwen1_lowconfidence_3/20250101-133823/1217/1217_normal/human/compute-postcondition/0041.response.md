`func_2(neigh, n)` is called, which means that `func_2` is executed with `neigh` and `n` as arguments. The function `func_2` may modify the variables `a`, `parent`, and possibly `n`. However, without knowing the exact implementation of `func_2`, we can only state that `func_2` modifies these variables.

Given the initial state, the precondition that `visited[neigh]` is `False` remains unchanged. The variables `n`, `a`, and `parent` may have been modified by `func_2`.

Output State: **`visited[neigh]` is `False`, `n` may have been updated by `func_2`, `a` and `parent` may have been modified by `func_2`**
