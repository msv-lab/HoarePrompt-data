Postcondition: **`newgcd` is assigned the value of `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])`, `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is updated to this value, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the number written on vertex `i+1`, `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex `n` in the tree traversal, `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a boolean list representing whether a vertex has been visited during the traversal, `visited[n]` is `True`, and the `parent` of the current vertex `n` is not `-1. The newgcd is greater than or equal to gcdinfo[parent].gcd, and either the condition gcdinfo[parent].ifr1 is true, in which case `newgcd1` is `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].ifr1, a[n])`, or gcdinfo[parent].ifr1 is false, in which case `newgcd1` is 1.**
