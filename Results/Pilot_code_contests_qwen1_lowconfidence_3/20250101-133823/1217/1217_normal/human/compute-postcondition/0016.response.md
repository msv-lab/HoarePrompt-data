The code assigns the value of `newgcd1` to `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].ifr1, a[n])`. Given the initial state, `newgcd1` is calculated based on `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` and `a[n]`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. `newgcd` is initially set to `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])`.
2. The value of `newgcd1` is now set to `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].ifr1, a[n])`.

Since `newgcd1` is being assigned a new value, the output state will include the new value of `newgcd1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`newgcd` is `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])`, `newgcd1` is `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].ifr1, a[n])`, `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is updated to `newgcd`, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the number written on vertex `i+1`, `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex `n` in the tree traversal, `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a boolean list representing whether a vertex has been visited during the traversal, `visited[n]` is `True`, and the `parent` of the current vertex `n` is not `-1. The newgcd is greater than or equal to gcdinfo[parent].gcd, and the condition gcdinfo[parent].ifr1 is true**.
