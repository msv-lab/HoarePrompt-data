`func_2(neigh, n)` is called, which may modify the values of `a`, `parent`, and `n`. However, since `func_2` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact changes it will make to these variables. The only thing we know is that `n` will be updated to the next neighbor in `graph[neigh]` after the function call.

Output State: **`n` is updated to the next neighbor in `graph[neigh]`; `a` and `parent` may have been modified by `func_2`; `visited[neigh]` is `True`**
