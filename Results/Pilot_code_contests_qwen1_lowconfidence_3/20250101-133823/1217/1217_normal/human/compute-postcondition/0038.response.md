Let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
- `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the number written on vertex `i+1`.
- `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex `n` in the tree traversal.
- `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree (must have at least one element in `graph[n]`).
- `visited` is a boolean list representing whether a vertex has been visited during the traversal, and `visited[n]` is `True`.
- `a` and `parent` may have been modified by `func_2`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for neigh in graph[n]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop iterates over each neighbor (`neigh`) of the current vertex `n` in the adjacency list `graph[n]`.
2. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer representing the current vertex.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `parent` is an integer.
   - `graph` is a list of lists with at least one element in `graph[n]`.
   - `visited` is a boolean list, and `visited[n]` is `True`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Current Vertex**: Since the loop is iterating over neighbors of `n`, we need to identify the next vertex `neigh` that will be processed in this iteration.
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - `n` will change to `neigh` because the loop is processing each neighbor of `n`.
   - `a` and `parent` might have been modified by `func_2`, so they could potentially be different.
   - `visited[neigh]` will be set to `True` because the next vertex will be visited.
   - `graph` remains the same.
   - `visited` will have `True` at the position of the current neighbor `neigh`.

### Final State:
- `n` is changed to the next neighbor `neigh` in `graph[n]`.
- `a` and `parent` might be modified, so they should reflect the latest values from `func_2`.
- `visited` will have `True` at the position of the current neighbor `neigh`.

### Example Answer:
State: **`n` is the next neighbor in `graph[n]`, `a` and `parent` may have been modified by `func_2`, `visited` is a boolean list with `visited[n]` being `True` and `visited[neigh]` being `True`**. 

In a specific format:
State: **`n` is the next neighbor in `graph[n]`, `a` and `parent` may have been modified by `func_2`, `visited` is a boolean list with `visited[neigh]` being `True`**.
