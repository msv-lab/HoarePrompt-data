Postcondition: ***`newgcd` is assigned the value of `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])`, `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is updated to this value, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the number written on vertex `i+1`, `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex `n` in the tree traversal, `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a boolean list representing whether a vertex has been visited during the traversal, `visited[n]` is `True`, and the `parent` of the current vertex `n` is not `-1`. If `newgcd < gcdinfo[parent].gcd`, then `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is `a[n]`, `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`, and `gcdinfo[n].ifr2` is `a[n]`. If `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` is 0, then `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is also set to `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`. Otherwise, `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is updated to either `gcdinfo[parent].tor1` or `gcdinfo[parent].tor2` and `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is updated to either `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` or `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2` based on the comparison of `newgcd1` and `newgcd2`.***
