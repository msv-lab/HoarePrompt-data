The function `func_2(neigh, n)` is called with two arguments: `neigh` (which likely refers to a neighbor of vertex `n` in the graph) and `n`. However, since the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the variables. Based on the provided information, the only variables that could potentially be affected are `a` and `parent`, as these might be updated within `func_2`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
- `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the number written on vertex `i+1`.
- `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex `n` in the tree traversal.
- `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree (must have at least one element in `graph[n]`).
- `visited` is a boolean list representing whether a vertex has been visited during the traversal, and `visited[n]` is `True`.

Since we don't know what `func_2` does, we assume it could modify `a` or `parent` but we cannot specify the exact changes without more information.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the number written on vertex `i+1`; `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex `n` in the tree traversal; `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree (must have at least one element in `graph[n]`); `visited` is a boolean list representing whether a vertex has been visited during the traversal, and `visited[n]` is `True`; `a` and `parent` may have been modified by `func_2`.**
