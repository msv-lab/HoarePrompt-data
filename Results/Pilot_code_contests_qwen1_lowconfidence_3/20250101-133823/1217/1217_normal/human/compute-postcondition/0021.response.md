`newgcd2` is assigned the value of `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].ifr2, a[n])`. The value of `newgcd` is already set, and it is greater than or equal to `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`. The condition `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2` is true. The value of `n`, `a`, `parent`, `graph`, and `visited` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newgcd` is assigned the value of `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])`, `newgcd2` is assigned the value of `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].ifr2, a[n])`, `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is updated to `newgcd`, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the number written on vertex `i+1`, `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex `n` in the tree traversal, `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a boolean list representing whether a vertex has been visited during the traversal, `visited[n]` is `True`, and the `parent` of the current vertex `n` is not `-1. The condition `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2` is true.

Output State: **`newgcd` is assigned the value of `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])`, `newgcd2` is assigned the value of `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].ifr2, a[n])`, `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is updated to `newgcd`, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the number written on vertex `i+1`, `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex `n` in the tree traversal, `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a boolean list representing whether a vertex has been visited during the traversal, `visited[n]` is `True`, and the `parent` of the current vertex `n` is not `-1. The condition `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2` is true.**
