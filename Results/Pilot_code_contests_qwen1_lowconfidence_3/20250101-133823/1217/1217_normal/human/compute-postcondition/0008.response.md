`gcdinfo[n].tor1` is assigned the value of `a[n]`. The previous value of `gcdinfo[n].tor1` was not specified, but now it is set to `a[n]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`newgcd` is assigned the value of `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])`, `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is updated to this value, `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is `a[n]`, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the number written on vertex `i+1`, `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex `n` in the tree traversal, `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a boolean list representing whether a vertex has been visited during the traversal, `visited[n]` is `True`, the `parent` of the current vertex `n` is not `-1`, and `newgcd` is less than `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`**
