Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `parent`, an integer representing the parent of the current vertex in the tree traversal. The function does not return any value, hence the return postconditions are `None`.

- It first checks if the vertex `n` has already been visited. If it has, the function returns without doing anything.
- If `n` has not been visited, it marks the vertex `n` as visited.
- If `parent` is not `-1`, it calculates a new GCD (`newgcd`) using the GCD of the parent vertex and the value at vertex `n`. Based on the comparison of `newgcd` with the parent's GCD, it updates the `gcdinfo` structure to maintain the relevant values (`tor1`, `ifr1`, `tor2`, `ifr2`).
- If `parent` is `-1`, no changes are made to the `gcdinfo` structure.
- It then recursively calls itself for each neighbor of vertex `n`, passing `n` as the new parent.

After the function completes, the `visited` list indicates that all vertices reachable from the starting vertex `n` have been visited. The `gcdinfo` structure is updated to reflect the GCD calculations and related values for each vertex based on the traversal order.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If the tree is empty (`n == 0`), the function will immediately return without doing anything since there are no vertices to visit.
- If `parent` is `-1`, the function does not update the `gcdinfo` structure for the root vertex, only marking it as visited.
- The function assumes that `graph` is a valid adjacency list representation of a tree with at least one edge.

**Missing Functionality:**
- There is no explicit handling for the case when `n` is the last vertex in the tree (i.e., it has no neighbors). In such a case, the recursive call to `func_2` would cause an issue since there would be no elements in `graph[n]`. This should be handled to prevent potential index out of range errors.**

This summary covers the core functionality of the function, potential edge cases, and missing parts of the logic.
