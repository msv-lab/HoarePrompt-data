The code updates the `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` variable to the value of `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`. Based on the initial state:

- `newgcd` is assigned the value of `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])`.
- `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is updated to this value (`newgcd`).
- `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is `a[n]`.
- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
- `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the number written on vertex `i+1`.
- `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex `n` in the tree traversal.
- `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree.
- `visited` is a boolean list representing whether a vertex has been visited during the traversal.
- `visited[n]` is `True`.
- The `parent` of the current vertex `n` is not `-1`.
- And `newgcd` is less than `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`.

After executing the line of code `gcdinfo[n].ifr1 = gcdinfo[parent].gcd`, the following changes occur:
- `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is now equal to `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`newgcd` is func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n]), `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is newgcd, `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is a[n], `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is gcdinfo[parent].gcd, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the number written on vertex i+1, `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex n in the tree traversal, `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a boolean list representing whether a vertex has been visited during the traversal, `visited[n]` is True, the parent of the current vertex n is not -1, and newgcd is less than gcdinfo[parent].gcd.**
