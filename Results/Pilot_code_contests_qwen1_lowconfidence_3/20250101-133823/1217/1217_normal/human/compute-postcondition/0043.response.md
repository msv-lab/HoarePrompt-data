The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters: `n`, `parent`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
- `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current vertex in the tree traversal.

The function does not return any value; hence, the return value is `None`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree and an integer `parent` representing the parent of the current vertex in the tree traversal, without returning any value.
