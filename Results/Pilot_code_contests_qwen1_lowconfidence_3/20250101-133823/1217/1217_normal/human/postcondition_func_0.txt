The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. It returns `a` if `b` is equal to 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with parameters `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` (i.e., `a % b`). This process continues until `b` becomes 0, at which point the function returns the last non-zero value of `a`, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. Potential edge cases include when either `a` or `b` is 0, in which case the function still correctly returns the non-zero value. The function does not have any missing functionality as described by the annotations.
