You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: For a given sequence A = {a0, a1, ... , an-1}, find the length of the longest increasing subsequnece (LIS) in A.

An increasing subsequence of A is defined by a subsequence {ai0, ai1, ... , aik} where 0 ≤ i0 < i1 < ... < ik < n and ai0 < ai1 < ... < aik.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000
* 0 ≤ ai ≤ 109

Input


n
a0
a1
:
an-1



In the first line, an integer n is given. In the next n lines, elements of A are given.

Output

The length of the longest increasing subsequence of A.

Program:
```
import bisect

def func():
    n = input()
    a = [input() for i in xrange(n)]
    dp = [float('inf') for _ in xrange(n)]
    for i in xrange(n):
        dp[bisect.bisect_left(dp, a[i])] = a[i]
    for i in xrange(n):
        if dp[i] == float('inf'):
            print(i)
            break


```
Output hints: The function processes a sequence of integers where the first integer `n` represents the length of the sequence, followed by `n` integers `ai` (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109). It uses a dynamic programming approach to maintain a sorted list `dp` of size `n`, where each element in `a` is inserted into `dp` while keeping it sorted. After processing the sequence, it prints the index of the first position in `dp` that is not initialized to infinity (`float('inf')`). If no such position is found, it does not print anything. The function does not return any specific value. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 1 or when all elements in `a` are equal. In the case where `n` is 1, the function will insert the single element into `dp` and check if it is the first (and only) position. If all elements in `a` are equal, the `dp` list will end up with duplicate values, but the function will still correctly identify the first non-infinite position.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
