Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). The issue lies in the way the `dp` array is used and how the length of the LIS is determined.

The code uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to update the `dp` array, which aims to maintain the smallest possible tail values for increasing subsequences of different lengths. However, the final output is incorrect because it prints the index where `dp[i]` is still `float('inf')`, which does not represent the length of the LIS.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:

Input:
```
4
10
22
9
30
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

But the program will output:
```
2
```

This is because the code incorrectly determines the length of the LIS by checking the last index where `dp[i]` is `float('inf')`, which does not reflect the actual length of the LIS. The correct approach would be to return the value of `i + 1` when the loop terminates, indicating the length of the LIS.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
import bisect

def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    dp = []
    for num in a:
        pos = bisect.bisect_left(dp, num)
        if pos == len(dp):
            dp.append(num)
        else:
            dp[pos] = num
    print(len(dp))

func()
```

This corrected version maintains the smallest possible tail values for increasing subsequences and returns the correct length of the LIS.
