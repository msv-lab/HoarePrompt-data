The code `print(i)` simply prints the value of `i`. Since the initial state of `i` is 2, printing `i` will output `2`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer input from the user with \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\), `a` is a list of exactly `n` strings, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where all elements of `a` are inserted into `dp` maintaining sorted order, and if `dp[2]` is infinity, the value 1 is printed. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged as no other actions are specified in the else part.**
