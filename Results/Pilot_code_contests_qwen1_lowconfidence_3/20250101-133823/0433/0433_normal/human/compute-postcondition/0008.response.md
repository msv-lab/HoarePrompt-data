The code snippet `dp[bisect.bisect_left(dp, a[i])] = a[i]` impacts the program by inserting the string `a[i]` into the list `dp` at the correct position to maintain the sorted order of `dp`. The value of `i` is `n-1`, meaning the last element of the list `a`.

Let's analyze the steps:

1. `bisect.bisect_left(dp, a[i])` finds the index in `dp` where `a[i]` can be inserted to keep the list sorted. Since `dp` is being updated in-place to maintain sorted order, this index will be the correct position for `a[i]`.
2. `dp[bisect.bisect_left(dp, a[i])] = a[i]` inserts `a[i]` at this position.

Given that `i` is `n-1`, `a[i]` is the last element of the list `a`. Since `dp` is already maintaining a sorted order, the last element `a[n-1]` will be inserted at its correct position, which is likely the end of the list `dp`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user with \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\), `a` is a list of exactly `n` strings, `dp` is a list of `n` elements with `a[i]` (where `i` is `n-1`) inserted at the correct position to maintain sorted order, `i` is `n-1`**
