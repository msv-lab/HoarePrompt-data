Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer input from the user with \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\), `a` is a list of exactly `n` strings, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where all elements of `a` are inserted into `dp` maintaining sorted order. If `dp[2]` is infinity, the value 1 is printed. Otherwise, no change occurs and the postcondition remains as initially described.***
