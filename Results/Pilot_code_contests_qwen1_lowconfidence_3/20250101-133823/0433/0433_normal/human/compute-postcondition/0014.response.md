Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an integer input from the user with \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\), `a` is a list of exactly `n` strings, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where all elements of `a` are inserted into `dp` maintaining sorted order, and if `dp[i]` is initially `float('inf')`, it is left unchanged, indicating that the condition inside the if block has been met.***
