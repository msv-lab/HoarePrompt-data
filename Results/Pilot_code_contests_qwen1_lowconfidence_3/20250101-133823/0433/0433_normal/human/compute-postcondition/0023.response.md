Output State: **`i` is the index of the first element in `dp` that is not `float('inf')`, `n` is an integer input from the user with \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\), `a` is a list of exactly `n` strings, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where all elements of `a` are inserted into `dp` maintaining sorted order. If such an element is found, its index is printed and the loop breaks. If no such element exists, the loop completes without printing anything, and `i` is set to `n`.**
