According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of `n`, where `i` starts from `0` and increments by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` is `n`.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer input from the user with \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\).
   - `a` is a list of exactly `n` strings.
   - `dp` is a list of `n` elements with `a[i]` inserted at the correct position to maintain sorted order.
   - `i` is `n`.

2. **Loop Execution**: 
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
   - In the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`.

3. **Next Iteration**: 
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each time, the next value of `i` would be `n-1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `n-1`.

The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
- `a` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
- `dp` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
- `i` changes from `n` to `n-1`.

State: **`n` is an integer input from the user with \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\), `a` is a list of exactly `n` strings, `dp` is a list of `n` elements with `a[i]` inserted at the correct position to maintain sorted order, `i` is `n-1`**.
