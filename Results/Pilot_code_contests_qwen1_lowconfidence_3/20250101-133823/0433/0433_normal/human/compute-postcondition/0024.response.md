The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it takes a sequence of integers as input through the function call, where the first integer `n` represents the length of the sequence, followed by `n` integers `ai` (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109). The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given output cases, but it implies that the function processes the sequence of integers.

Functionality: **The function processes a sequence of integers, where the first integer `n` represents the length of the sequence, followed by `n` integers `ai` (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109), and does not return any specific value.**
