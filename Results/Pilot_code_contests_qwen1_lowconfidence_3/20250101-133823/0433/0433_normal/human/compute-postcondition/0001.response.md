`a` is assigned a list of `n` strings, each representing an integer input from the user. The values of `n` and the individual integers `ai` (0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9) are taken from the input. The original value of `n` is no longer directly accessible as it is used to determine the length of the list `a`. Each element in `a` is a string representation of one of the `ai` values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000; `a` is a list of `n` strings, each string is an integer input from the user**
