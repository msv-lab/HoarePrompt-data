Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer input from the user with \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\).
   - `a` is a list of exactly `n` strings.
   - `dp` is a list of `n` elements where all elements of `a` are inserted into `dp` maintaining sorted order.
   - If `dp[i]` is initially `float('inf')`, it is left unchanged, indicating that the condition inside the if block has been met.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `n` remains the same (an integer input from the user with \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\)).
   - `a` remains the same (a list of exactly `n` strings).
   - `dp` remains the same (a list of `n` elements where all elements of `a` are inserted into `dp` maintaining sorted order).

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` becomes 1.
   - All other states (`n`, `a`, and `dp`) remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop based on the given information.

Therefore, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer input from the user with \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\), `a` is a list of exactly `n` strings, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where all elements of `a` are inserted into `dp` maintaining sorted order.**
