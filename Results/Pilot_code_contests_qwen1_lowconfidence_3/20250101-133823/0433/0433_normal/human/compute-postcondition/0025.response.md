Functionality: **The function processes a sequence of integers where the first integer `n` represents the length of the sequence, followed by `n` integers `ai` (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109). It uses a dynamic programming approach to maintain a sorted list `dp` of size `n`, where each element in `a` is inserted into `dp` while keeping it sorted. After processing the sequence, it prints the index of the first position in `dp` that is not initialized to infinity (`float('inf')`). If no such position is found, it does not print anything. The function does not return any specific value. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 1 or when all elements in `a` are equal. In the case where `n` is 1, the function will insert the single element into `dp` and check if it is the first (and only) position. If all elements in `a` are equal, the `dp` list will end up with duplicate values, but the function will still correctly identify the first non-infinite position.**
