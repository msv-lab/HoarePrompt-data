Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer input from the user with \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\).
   - `a` is a list of exactly `n` strings.
   - `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element is `float('inf')`.

2. **Code Snippet**: 
   ```python
   dp[bisect.bisect_left(dp, a[i])] = a[i]
   ```

   This line of code uses the `bisect_left` function to find the index in the `dp` list where `a[i]` should be inserted to maintain sorted order. It then assigns `a[i]` to that index in the `dp` list.

3. **Impact Analysis**:
   - `a[i]` is a string.
   - `bisect_left(dp, a[i])` returns the index in `dp` where `a[i]` should be inserted to keep `dp` sorted.
   - `dp[bisect.bisect_left(dp, a[i])]` updates the `dp` list at that specific index with the value of `a[i]`.

Since `a[i]` is a string and `dp` initially contains `float('inf')` values, the `bisect_left` function will insert `a[i]` into the `dp` list, replacing the first `float('inf')` it encounters with the string `a[i]`.

Given that `a` is a list of exactly `n` strings, and assuming no duplicates (since no specific handling of duplicates is mentioned), the first `a[i]` will replace the first `float('inf')` in `dp`. If there are duplicate strings in `a`, they will overwrite subsequent `float('inf')` values as per their order.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `dp` has been updated such that the first occurrence of `a[i]` (as determined by `bisect_left`) is replaced with `a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user with \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\), `a` is a list of exactly `n` strings, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where the first occurrence of `a[i]` is replaced with `a[i]`.**
