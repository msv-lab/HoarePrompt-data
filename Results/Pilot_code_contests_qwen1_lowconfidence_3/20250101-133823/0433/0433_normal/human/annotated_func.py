#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, and there are n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109) following in the input, representing the sequence A.
def func():
    n = input()
    a = [input() for i in xrange(n)]
    dp = [float('inf') for _ in xrange(n)]
    for i in xrange(n):
        dp[bisect.bisect_left(dp, a[i])] = a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer input from the user with \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\), `a` is a list of exactly `n` strings, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where all elements of `a` are inserted into `dp` maintaining sorted order, `i` is `n`.
    for i in xrange(n):
        if dp[i] == float('inf'):
            print(i)
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is the index of the first element in `dp` that is not `float('inf')`, `n` is an integer input from the user with \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\), `a` is a list of exactly `n` strings, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where all elements of `a` are inserted into `dp` maintaining sorted order. If such an element is found, its index is printed and the loop breaks. If no such element exists, the loop completes without printing anything, and `i` is set to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a sequence of integers where the first integer `n` represents the length of the sequence, followed by `n` integers `ai` (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109). It uses a dynamic programming approach to maintain a sorted list `dp` of size `n`, where each element in `a` is inserted into `dp` while keeping it sorted. After processing the sequence, it prints the index of the first position in `dp` that is not initialized to infinity (`float('inf')`). If no such position is found, it does not print anything. The function does not return any specific value. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 1 or when all elements in `a` are equal. In the case where `n` is 1, the function will insert the single element into `dp` and check if it is the first (and only) position. If all elements in `a` are equal, the `dp` list will end up with duplicate values, but the function will still correctly identify the first non-infinite position.
