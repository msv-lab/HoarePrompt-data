The function prompts the user to input an integer and returns this integer. The function does not perform any validation on the input, so it may return any integer value within the range of Python's integer type, including negative numbers and very large numbers. There are no preconditions specified for the input other than it being an integer. The function does not modify any external state and relies solely on user input.
