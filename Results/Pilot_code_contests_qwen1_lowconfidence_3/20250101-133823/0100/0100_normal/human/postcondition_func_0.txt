The function `func_1` takes no parameters and returns a tuple of integers. These integers are derived by splitting the string returned by `func_3()` into individual elements and converting each element to an integer. The function does not handle any potential errors that may arise during the conversion process, such as non-integer values in the split string. Therefore, if `func_3()` returns a string containing non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`. There are no specified edge cases or additional actions performed by the function beyond these operations.
