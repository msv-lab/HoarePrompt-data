`a` is initially set to the return value of `func_2()`. `n` is decremented by 1, making it `n - 1`. `x` is 1. The code `a[0] += n - x` modifies the first element of the list `a` by adding `n - x` to it. Since `x` is 1, this is equivalent to `a[0] += (n - 1) - 1` or `a[0] += n - 2`.

Therefore, the updated value of `a[0]` is the original value of `a[0]` plus `n - 2`.

Output State: **`a` is equal to the return value of `func_2()`, `n` is equal to `n - 1`, `x` is 1, `a[0]` is the original value of `a[0]` plus `n - 2`.**
