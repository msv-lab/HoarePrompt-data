Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a[i]` is now `a[i] + b[i - 1]`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `b` contains at least one additional element which is `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented from its current value to `i + 1`.

2. **Current Value of `i`**:
   - Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote it as `i_end`.
   - According to the range, `i_end` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue.

3. **Updating `i`**:
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 each time it executes.
   - Therefore, if `i_end` is the current value of `i`, then the next value of `i` will be `i_end + 1`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `a[i]` will be updated to `a[i] + b[i - 1]` for the new `i`.
   - `n` remains the same unless the loop modifies it, but based on the given information, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1.
   - The list `b` should contain an additional element, which is `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`, where `i` is now `i_end + 1`.

### Final States:
- `a[i_end + 1]` will be updated to `a[i_end + 1] + b[i_end]`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `b` should contain at least one additional element, which is `a[i_end + 1] % n * (n - 1)`.

### Updated State:
State: **`a[i_end + 1]` is now `a[i_end + 1] + b[i_end]`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `b` contains at least one additional element which is `a[i_end + 1] % n * (n - 1)`**.
