The code snippet `a[i] = -a[i]` updates the value of `a[i]` to be the negation of its current value. Given that `i` is 2, the value of `a[2]` will be updated. Initially, `a[1]` is negated, but we don't know the specific value of `a[2]`. However, since `a[1]` being negated doesn't affect `a[2]`, we only need to focus on updating `a[2]`.

Since `i` is 2, the value of `a[2]` is negated. Therefore, the updated state of the array `a` will have `a[2]` negated.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a[1]` is negated, `a[2]` is negated**
