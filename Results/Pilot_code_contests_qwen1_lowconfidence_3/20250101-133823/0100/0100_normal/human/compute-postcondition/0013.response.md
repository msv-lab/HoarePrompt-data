The code appends the value of `a[i] % n * (n - 1)` to the list `b`. From the initial state, we know that `b` contains at least one additional element which is `a[i_end + 1] % n * (n - 1)`. The value of `a[i] % n * (n - 1)` will be appended to `b`.

Since `a[i_end + 1]` is already set to `a[i_end + 1] + b[i_end]`, this value remains unchanged by the code. Also, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `b` contains at least one additional element which is `a[i_end + 1] % n * (n - 1)`.

Therefore, the updated state of `b` will include the new element `a[i] % n * (n - 1)` in addition to the existing element `a[i_end + 1] % n * (n - 1)`.

Output State: **`a[i_end + 1]` is `a[i_end + 1] + b[i_end]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` contains at least two elements: `a[i_end + 1] % n * (n - 1)` and `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`**
