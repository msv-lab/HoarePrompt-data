According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `a[1]` is negated

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must still be less than `n`.

Since `i` starts from 1 and increases by 1 each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, the only condition we need to adjust is ensuring `i` is less than `n`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a[1]` is negated**
