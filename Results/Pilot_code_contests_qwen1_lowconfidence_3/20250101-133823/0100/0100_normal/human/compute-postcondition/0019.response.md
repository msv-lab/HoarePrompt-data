Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.
   - `b` is a list containing elements `a[i] % n * (n - 1)` for each iteration.
   - `x` is 1.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code prints the elements of list `b` using `print(*b)`. This means that the elements of `b` are printed in a space-separated format, but the actual content of `b` remains unchanged.

3. **Impact**:
   - The printing operation does not modify any of the variables; it only outputs the current state of `b`.

4. **Output State**:
   - The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain as they were before the print statement was executed.
   - The only change is that the elements of `b` are printed.

Given this, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`, `b` is a list containing elements `a[i] % n * (n - 1)` for each iteration, and `x` is 1. The elements of `b` are printed.**
