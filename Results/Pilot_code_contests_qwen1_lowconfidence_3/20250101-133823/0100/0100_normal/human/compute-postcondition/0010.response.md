`b` is appended with the value of `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`. The initial state is that `a` is a list with at least one element, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. The values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged, but `b` gains a new element.

Output State: **`a` is a list with at least one element; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `b` contains at least one additional element which is `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`**
