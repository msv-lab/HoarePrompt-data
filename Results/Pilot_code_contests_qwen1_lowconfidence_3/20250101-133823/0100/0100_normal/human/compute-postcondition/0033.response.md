The code `print(*a)` simply prints the elements of the list `a`. It does not modify the list `a` or any other variables. Therefore, the output of this code will be the negated elements of the list `a` as they were initially.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- Each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is negated.

After the code is executed, the list `a` remains unchanged from its initial negated state, and the elements are printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is negated, and the negated elements of `a` are printed.**
