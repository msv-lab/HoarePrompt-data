Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a[i_end + 1]` is updated to `a[i_end + 1] + b[i_end]`.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` inclusive.
   - Each iteration updates the value of `a[i]` based on the current value of `a[i]` and `n`.

4. **Determine the Next Iteration's State:**
   - To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what happens to `i` and `n` in the loop.
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`, in the next iteration, `i` would be `1` if it's the first iteration of the loop, or `i+1` for subsequent iterations.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged as per the loop statement.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i_end` is not explicitly mentioned in the loop, but it seems like `i_end` could be the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. In the next iteration, `i_end` would be incremented by 1, making `i_end + 1` the new value.
   - `a[i_end + 1]` needs to be updated according to the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we can infer that it follows the pattern of `a[i_end + 1] = a[i_end + 1] + b[i_end]`.
   - `a[i]` will be updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`, where `i` is now `i + 1`.

Given these observations, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `a[i_end + 1]` will be updated to `a[i_end + 1] + b[i_end]` where `i_end` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- `a[i]` will be updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)` for the new `i` which is `i + 1`.

Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, in the next iteration, `i` would be 2 if it was 1 previously, and so on.

**State:**
- `a[i_end + 1]` is updated to `a[i_end + 1] + b[i_end]`.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)` where `i` is `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
**`a[i_end + 1]` is updated to `a[i_end + 1] + b[i_end]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)` where `i` is `i + 1`.**
