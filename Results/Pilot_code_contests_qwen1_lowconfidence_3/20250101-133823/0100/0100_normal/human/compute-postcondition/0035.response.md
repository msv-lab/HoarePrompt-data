Functionality: **The function processes a list `a` of integers and modifies its elements based on the length `n` of the list. Initially, it prints the value 1 followed by 1. It then updates the first element of the list `a` to be congruent modulo `n`. For each element in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, it calculates the value `a[i] % n * (n - 1)` and adds it to the current element. This process is repeated until `n` becomes 1. If `n` is initially 1, it directly prints 1 and 1, followed by 0. After processing, it prints 1 again followed by the current value of `n`, and then negates all elements in the list `a`. Finally, it prints the negated list `a`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `n` is 1 initially, the function correctly handles this case by printing 1, 1, and 0.
- The function correctly updates each element in the list `a` to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)` for `1 <= i < n`.
- The function correctly negates all elements in the list `a` after the main processing loop.
