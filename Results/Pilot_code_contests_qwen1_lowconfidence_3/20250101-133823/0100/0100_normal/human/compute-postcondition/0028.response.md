According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be a positive integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
- `n` must still be a positive integer greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 1**
