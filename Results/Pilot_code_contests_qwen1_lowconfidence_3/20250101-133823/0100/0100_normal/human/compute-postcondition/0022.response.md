The code `print(1, 1)` simply prints the numbers 1 and 1. This does not affect any of the existing variables. The precondition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`, `n` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `x` is 1, and `b` is a list containing elements `a[i] % n * (n - 1)` for each iteration, and the print statement outputs 1 and 1.**
