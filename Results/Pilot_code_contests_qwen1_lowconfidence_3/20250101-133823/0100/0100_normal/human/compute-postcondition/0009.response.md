Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `a` is equal to the return value of `func_2()`.
- `n` is equal to `initial_n - 1`.
- `x` is 1.
- `a[0]` is the original value of `a[0]` plus `n - 2`.
- The print statement outputs `2, initial_n - 1`.

### Loop Information:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and goes up to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be within this range for the loop to execute properly.
   
2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` is derived from `initial_n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`.
   - Hence, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Variable `a`:**
   - `a` is the return value of `func_2()`.
   - Since the loop accesses `a[0]`, `a` must be a list with at least one element (i.e., `a[0]` should exist).

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `x` is 1 and is not used in the loop.
   - The output `2, initial_n - 1` suggests that the loop might be modifying some state, but we only need to focus on ensuring the loop can start executing based on the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the following states:
- Ensure `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- Ensure `a` is a list with at least one element.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
