To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to run:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.
   - `n` is a positive integer decreased by 1.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `b` is a list containing elements `a[i] % n * (n - 1)` for each iteration.
   - The printed values are 1 and `n`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i < n`.
   - In each iteration, the value of `a[i]` is updated as `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.
   - The value `a[i] % n * (n - 1)` is appended to list `b`.
   - After the loop, the values printed are 1 and `n`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer, and the loop should iterate from `0` to `n-1`.
   - The initial value of `x` being 1 is irrelevant to the loop's execution condition but might be part of another context or initialization.

4. **Required Adjustments**:
   - `n` must be a positive integer (since `n` is a positive integer decreased by 1).
   - The loop will start with `i = 0` and will continue as long as `i < n`.

Based on the above analysis, the required states to adjust for the loop to execute are:

- `n` must be a positive integer.
- `i` should start at 0.
- `n` should be greater than 0 to allow the loop to iterate at least once.

Given the printed values (1 and `n`), it implies that the loop runs and updates the list `a` accordingly, and `b` contains the calculated values based on the updates.

Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be a positive integer, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0**.
