Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `a[i_end + 1]` is updated to `a[i_end + 1] + b[i_end]`.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)` where `i` is `i + 1`.

2. The code snippet provided is:
   ```python
   b.append(a[i] % n * (n - 1))
   ```

3. Let's break down the impact of this code:
   - `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`, and then `b.append(a[i] % n * (n - 1))` is executed.
   - This means `b` will contain the value of `a[i] % n * (n - 1)` at the current index.

Given the initial state and the code, the new state is:
- `a[i_end + 1]` is still updated to `a[i_end + 1] + b[i_end]`.
- `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.
- `b` now includes the value `a[i] % n * (n - 1)` at the latest index appended.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a[i_end + 1]` is updated to `a[i_end + 1] + b[i_end]`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)` where `i` is `i + 1`; `b` includes the value `a[i] % n * (n - 1)` at the latest index appended.**
