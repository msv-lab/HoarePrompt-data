The code snippet `n = func_4()` assigns the return value of `func_4()` to `n`. Since the exact implementation of `func_4()` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `n`. However, based on the initial state, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000 inclusive. After executing this line of code, `n` will still be within this range, but its specific value depends on what `func_4()` returns.

The output state remains the same in terms of the constraints for `n`, but `n` itself changes to whatever `func_4()` returns.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers such that -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and now `n` is equal to the return value of `func_4()`**
