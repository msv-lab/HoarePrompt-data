The code `print(2, n)` prints the value `2` followed by the value of `n`. Since the initial state says `n` is equal to `n - 1`, the new value of `n` will be one less than its initial value. However, since the exact initial value of `n` is not specified, we can denote the initial value of `n` as `initial_n`. Therefore, after the code runs, `n` will be `initial_n - 1`.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet. The output of the print statement is `2` followed by the updated value of `n`.

Output State: **`a` is equal to the return value of `func_2()`, `n` is equal to `initial_n - 1`, `x` is 1, `a[0]` is the original value of `a[0]` plus `n - 2`, and the print statement outputs `2, initial_n - 1`.**
