The print statement outputs `0`. This does not affect the values of the variables `a`, `n`, `x`, or `b`. The initial state remains unchanged except for the printed value.

Output State: **`a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`, `n` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `x` is 1, and `b` is a list containing elements `a[i] % n * (n - 1)` for each iteration; the print statement outputs 0.**
