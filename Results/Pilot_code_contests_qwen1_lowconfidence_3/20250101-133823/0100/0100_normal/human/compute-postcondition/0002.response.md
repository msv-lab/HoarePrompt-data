The code `print(1, 1)` simply prints the numbers 1 and 1 to the console. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is equal to the return value of `func_2()`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and is equal to the return value of `func_4()`, and the console prints "1 1"**
