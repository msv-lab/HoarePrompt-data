The code snippet `a[i] += b[i - 1]` increments the value of `a[i]` by `b[i - 1]`. 

- The value of `a[i]` was originally `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.
- After the operation, the new value of `a[i]` becomes `a[i] + b[i - 1]`.

Other variables are not affected, so their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a[i]` is now `a[i] + b[i - 1]`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `b` contains at least one additional element which is `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`**
