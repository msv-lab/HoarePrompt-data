`a[i]` is assigned the value of itself plus `b[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `a[i_end + 1]` is `a[i_end + 1] + b[i_end]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `b` contains at least two elements: `a[i_end + 1] % n * (n - 1)` and `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`. Since `b[i - 1]` is one of these elements, and its value is known to be `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`, the new value of `a[i]` will be `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`. 

Therefore, the updated state is: `a[i_end + 1]` is `a[i_end + 1] + b[i_end]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `a[i]` is now `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.

Output State: **`a[i_end + 1]` is `a[i_end + 1] + b[i_end]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i]` is `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`**
