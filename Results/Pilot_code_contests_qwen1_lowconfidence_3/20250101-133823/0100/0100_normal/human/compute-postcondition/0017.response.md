The code `a[i] += b[i - 1]` updates the value of `a[i]` by adding `b[i - 1]` to it. Based on the initial state:

- `a[i_end + 1]` is updated to `a[i_end + 1] + b[i_end]`
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`, where `i` is `i + 1`
- `b` includes the value `a[i] % n * (n - 1)` at the latest index appended

After executing the line `a[i] += b[i - 1]`:

- The value of `a[i]` is updated to its previous value plus `b[i - 1]`.
- The values of `a[i_end + 1]`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a[i_end + 1]` is `a[i_end + 1] + b[i_end]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i]` is `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`, `b` includes the value `a[i] % n * (n - 1)` at the latest index appended, and `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + b[i - 1]`.**
