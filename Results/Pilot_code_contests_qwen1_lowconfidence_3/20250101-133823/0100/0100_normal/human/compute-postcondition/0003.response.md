The code `x = a[0] % n` assigns the value of `a[0] % n` to `x`. Here, `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, the return value of `func_4()`. The initial state also mentions that the console prints "1 1", which implies that `a[0]` is 1. Therefore, `x` will be `1 % n`, which is simply `1` since `n` is at least 1.

Output State: **`a` is equal to the return value of `func_2()`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and is equal to the return value of `func_4()`, `x` is 1**
