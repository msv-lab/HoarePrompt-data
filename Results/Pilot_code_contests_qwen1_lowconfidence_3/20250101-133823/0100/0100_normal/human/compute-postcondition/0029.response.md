The code `a[i] = -a[i]` modifies the element in the list `a` at index `i`. Given the initial state where `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and `i` is 1, the value of `a[i]` is updated to its negation. However, since `a` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[1]` before the operation. The only thing we know is that `a[1]` is being negated.

The variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a[1]` is negated**
