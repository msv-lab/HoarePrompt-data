The code `b = []` creates an empty list and assigns it to the variable `b`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `n`, `x`, `a[0]`, or the print statement's output. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is equal to the return value of `func_2()`, `n` is equal to `initial_n - 1`, `x` is 1, `a[0]` is the original value of `a[0]` plus `n - 2`, and the print statement outputs `2, initial_n - 1`.**
