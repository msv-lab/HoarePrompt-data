The code snippet `a[i] = -a[i]` attempts to update the element in the list `a` at index `i`. However, there is no list `a` or its size defined in the initial state. Since `i` is 0, the code would try to modify the first element of `a` (if `a` existed), but since `a` is not defined, this operation cannot be performed. Thus, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be a positive integer, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0**
