The code `a = func_2()` assigns the return value of `func_2()` to the variable `a`. However, the specific implementation of `func_2()` is not provided. Since no specific details about `func_2()` are given, we can only state that `a` now holds the return value of `func_2()`. 

The value of `n` is equal to the return value of `func_4()`, which is unchanged by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is equal to the return value of `func_2()`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and is equal to the return value of `func_4()`.
Output State: **`a` is equal to the return value of `func_2()`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and is equal to the return value of `func_4()`**
