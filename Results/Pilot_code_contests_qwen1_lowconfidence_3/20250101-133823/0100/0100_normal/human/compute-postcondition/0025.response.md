The code snippet `print(1, n)` prints the values 1 and `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer that is decreased by 1, `n` is now one less than its original value. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state because no operations are performed on them within the given code snippet. The print statement itself does not alter the variables, it only outputs their current values.

Output State: **`a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`, `n` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `x` is 1, `b` is a list containing elements `a[i] % n * (n - 1)` for each iteration, and the printed values are 1 and `n`.**
