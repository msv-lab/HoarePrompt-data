Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `x` is 1.
- `b` is a list containing elements `a[i] % n * (n - 1)` for each iteration.
- The printed values are 1 and `n`.

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    a[i] = -a[i]
```

### Analysis of the Loop:
- The loop iterates `n` times, updating each element `a[i]` to its negative value.
- After the loop, `a` will contain the negated values of its original elements.

### Output States after the First Few Iterations:
- **After 1 iteration:** `n` must be a positive integer, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. `a[0]` is negated.
- **After 2 iterations:** `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a[1]` is negated.
- **After 3 iterations:** `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a[1]` is negated, `a[2]` is negated.

From these observations, we can deduce that after the loop completes, all elements in the list `a` will be negated.

### Final Output State:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `i` will be `n` after the last iteration.
- Each element `a[i]` in the list `a` will be negated.

### Conclusion:
The output state of the loop after all iterations have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, and each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is negated.**
