Precondition: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, and mod is a positive integer representing the modulus for the factorial calculations.** 

Note: The provided function `func_7` does not seem to directly relate to solving the main problem described in the problem statement. It appears to be a helper function for calculating factorials under a given modulus. However, based on the task at hand, the precondition focuses on the inputs `n` and `mod` as described.
