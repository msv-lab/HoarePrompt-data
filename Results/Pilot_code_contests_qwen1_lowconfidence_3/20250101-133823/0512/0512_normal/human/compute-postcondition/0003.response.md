The code initializes a list `dp` with `False` values, where the length of the list is `k + 1`. The values of `N`, `K`, `a`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `dp` list.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100; `K` is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers sorted in strictly increasing order such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ K for all i in range N; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input; `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` with all elements set to `False`.**
