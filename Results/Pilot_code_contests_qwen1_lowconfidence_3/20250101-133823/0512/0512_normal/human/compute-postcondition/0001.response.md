The code reads two integers from input, splits them, and converts them to integers. These values are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The initial values of `N` and `K` are replaced by the input values. The list `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, `K` is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers sorted in strictly increasing order such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ K for all i in range N, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input**
