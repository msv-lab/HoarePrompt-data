The function `func` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `a`. `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, `K` is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers sorted in strictly increasing order such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ K for all i in range N.

The output is described in two cases:
- Case_1: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, `K` is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers sorted in strictly increasing order such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ K for all i in range N. If the conditions are met, the function returns the list `a`.
- Case_2: None of the other cases apply.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept parameters `N`, `K`, and `a` and return the list `a` if the given conditions are satisfied; otherwise, no return value is specified in the problem statement.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `N`, `K`, and `a`. If `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, `K` is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers sorted in strictly increasing order such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ K for all i in range N, the function returns the list `a`.**
