The code `dp[ai] = True` sets the value of `dp[ai]` to `True`. Given the initial state, `ai` refers to the next element in the list `a` for which `dp[ai_next]` is `False`. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `a` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in strictly increasing order, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` with all elements set to `False`, `dp[ai]` is `True` where `ai` is the next element in the list `a` for which `dp[ai_next]` is `False`.**
