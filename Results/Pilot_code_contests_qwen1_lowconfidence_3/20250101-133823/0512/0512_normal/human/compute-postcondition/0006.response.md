According to the code, the loop iterates over each element `ai` in the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next element `ai` in the list `a` must be read and processed.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `N` is at least 1
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in strictly increasing order
- `n` is an integer read from input
- `k` is an integer read from input
- `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` with all elements set to `False`
- `dp[ai]` is `True`

Since the list `a` is sorted in strictly increasing order, the next element `ai` in the list must be the next integer in the sequence. The current value of `ai` is the smallest integer in the list `a` for which `dp[ai]` is `True`.

To determine the next state, we need to identify the next value of `ai` in the list `a` and ensure it is the smallest integer greater than the current `ai` for which `dp[ai]` is `True`.

Given that the list `a` is sorted in strictly increasing order and the current value of `dp[ai]` is `True`, the next value of `ai` must be the next integer in the list `a` for which `dp[ai]` is still `False` or not yet checked.

Therefore, the next value of `ai` will be the next element in the list `a` that hasn't been processed yet. Since the list `a` is sorted and `dp[ai]` is `True`, the next `ai` will be the next integer in the list.

State: **`N` is at least 1, `a` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in strictly increasing order, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` with all elements set to `False`, `dp[ai_next]` is `False` where `ai_next` is the next element in the list `a` for which `dp[ai_next]` is `False`**
