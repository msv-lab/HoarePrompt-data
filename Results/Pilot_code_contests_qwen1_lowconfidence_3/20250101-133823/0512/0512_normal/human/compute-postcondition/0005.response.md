The code snippet `dp[ai] = True` updates the value of `dp[ai]` to `True`. Here, `ai` refers to an element in the list `a`. Since the list `a` is sorted in strictly increasing order and `ai` is one of its elements, the value of `dp[ai]` is set to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `a` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in strictly increasing order, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` with all elements set to `False`, `dp[ai]` is `True`**
