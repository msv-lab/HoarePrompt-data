Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `a` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in strictly increasing order, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` with all elements set to `True`.**

### Explanation:
- **`N` and `a`:** Since `a` is a list of integers sorted in strictly increasing order and `N` is the length of this list, `N` must be at least 1 and `a` must be a non-empty list. The list `a` contains integers from 1 to some maximum value not exceeding `K`.
- **`n` and `k`:** These are integers read from input, so their values are determined by the input and do not change within the loop.
- **`dp`:** The `dp` list starts off as a list of length `k + 1` with all elements set to `False`. During each iteration of the loop, `dp[ai]` is set to `True` where `ai` is an element from the list `a`. Since `a` is sorted in strictly increasing order and the loop runs until all elements in `a` have been processed, every index `i` in `dp` from 0 to `k` will eventually be set to `True`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, `dp` will have all its elements set to `True`.
