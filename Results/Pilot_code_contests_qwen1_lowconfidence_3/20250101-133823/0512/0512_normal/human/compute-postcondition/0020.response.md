Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `a`. It reads `N` and `K` from input, where `N` is the number of elements in the list `a` and `K` is an integer such that `1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5`. The list `a` is a list of integers sorted in strictly increasing order such that `1 ≤ a_i ≤ K` for all `i` in range `N`. The function constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` of length `k + 1` initialized to `False`. It then sets `dp[ai]` to `True` for each element `ai` in `a`. After that, it iterates from `max(a) + 1` to `k` and updates `dp[i]` to `True` if there exists at least one `ai` in `a` such that `dp[i - ai]` is `False`. Finally, the function writes 'First' to the output if `dp[k]` is `True`, otherwise it writes 'Second'. Potential edge cases include when `N` is 1 and `a` contains only one element, or when `K` is much larger than the maximum value in `a`.**

Note: The annotation mentions that the function returns the list `a`, but the actual function does not return anything. It writes the result to standard output instead.
