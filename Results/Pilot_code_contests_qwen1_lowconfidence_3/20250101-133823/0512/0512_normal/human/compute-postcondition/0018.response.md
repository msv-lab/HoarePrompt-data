The code snippet `os.write(1, 'First' if dp[k] else 'Second')` checks the value of `dp[k]`. If `dp[k]` is `True`, it writes 'First' to standard output (file descriptor 1). If `dp[k]` is `False`, it writes 'Second' to standard output.

Since the problem does not involve changing any variable values other than potentially writing to standard output, the variables `dp`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `i` is also unchanged as it was not used in the code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `k + 1` where `dp[i]` is `True` if and only if there exists at least one `ai` in `a` such that `dp[i - ai]` is `False`; `i` is `k + 1`; `a` is unchanged; the output written to standard output is 'First' if `dp[k]` is `True`, otherwise 'Second'.**
