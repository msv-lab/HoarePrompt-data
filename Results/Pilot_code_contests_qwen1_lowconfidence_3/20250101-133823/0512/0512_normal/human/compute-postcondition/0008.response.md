According to the code, the loop iterates over each element `ai` in the list `a`. For the loop to execute again, `ai` must be the next element in the list `a` for which `dp[ai]` is `False`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
- `N` is at least 1
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in strictly increasing order
- `n` is an integer read from input
- `k` is an integer read from input
- `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` with all elements set to `False`
- `dp[ai]` is `True` where `ai` is the next element in the list `a` for which `dp[ai_next]` is `False`

To determine the next state for the loop to execute, we need to identify the next element `ai` in the list `a` for which `dp[ai]` is `False`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Since `a` is a list of integers sorted in strictly increasing order, the next element `ai` for which `dp[ai]` is `False` must be the smallest such element.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `dp[ai]` was `True` where `ai` was the next element in the list `a` for which `dp[ai_next]` was `False`. This means that `ai` was the last element for which `dp[ai]` was `False`.
3. The next element `ai` for which `dp[ai]` is `False` must be the smallest element in `a` that is larger than `ai` and for which `dp[ai]` is still `False`.

Therefore, the next element `ai` must be the smallest element in `a` that is larger than the current `ai` and for which `dp[ai]` is `False`.

State: **`N` is at least 1, `a` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in strictly increasing order, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` with all elements set to `False`, `dp[ai_next]` is `False` where `ai_next` is the smallest element in `a` that is larger than the current `ai` for which `dp[ai_next]` is `False`**.
