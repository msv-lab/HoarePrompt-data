To understand the task, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Current State**: 
   - `dp` is updated as described.
   - `i` is `max(a) + 1`.
   - `a` values are unchanged.
   - `dp[i]` is determined by the condition `any(not dp[i - ai] for ai in a)`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` from `max(a) + 1` to `k + 1`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Since `i` is currently `max(a) + 1`, the next value of `i` would be `max(a) + 2`.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will check the condition `any(not dp[i - ai] for ai in a)` for the new value of `i`, which is `max(a) + 2`.
   - Therefore, `dp[i - ai]` will be checked for `i = max(a) + 2` and all values of `ai` in `a`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `dp` remains unchanged as no further updates are specified.
   - `i` changes from `max(a) + 1` to `max(a) + 2`.
   - The condition for the next iteration involves checking if there exists an `ai` such that `dp[max(a) + 2 - ai]` is `False`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` changes from `max(a) + 1` to `max(a) + 2`.
- The condition for `dp[i]` (where `i = max(a) + 2`) needs to be checked based on the current state of `dp`.

Thus, the final state is:

**State: `dp` is updated as described, `i` is `max(a) + 2`, `a` values are unchanged, `dp[i]` is determined by the condition `any(not dp[i - ai] for ai in a)` where `i = max(a) + 2`**.
