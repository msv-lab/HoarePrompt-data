Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a logical error in its approach to determining the winner of the game. Specifically, the dynamic programming array `dp` is used to determine if a position `i` is winning or losing, but the logic for updating `dp[i]` is flawed. The condition `any((not dp[i - ai] for ai in a))` means that `dp[i]` is set to `True` if there is at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent (`dp[i - ai]` is `False`). However, this does not correctly simulate the game's alternating turns and optimal play strategy.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that the `dp` array is updated such that `dp[i]` is `True` if there is any move that leads to a losing position for the opponent. This requires checking all possible moves and ensuring that at least one of them results in a losing position for the opponent.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted([int(i) for i in input().split()])
    dp = [False] * (k + 1)
    dp[0] = True  # Base case: if there are 0 stones, the current player loses

    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for ai in a:
            if i >= ai and not dp[i - ai]:
                dp[i] = True
                break

    os.write(1, 'First' if dp[k] else 'Second')

```

In this corrected version, `dp[i]` is set to `True` if there exists any move that leads to a losing position (`not dp[i - ai]`) for the opponent. This ensures that the `dp` array correctly reflects whether a position is winning or losing under optimal play.
