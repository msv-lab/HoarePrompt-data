Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program seems to be an attempt to solve the problem using dynamic programming. However, there is a logical error in the implementation of the dynamic programming table `dp`. Specifically, the line `dp[ai] = True` is setting `dp[ai]` to `True`, which is incorrect because it implies that if there are `ai` stones, the current player can always make a move. This is not true since the game ends when a player cannot make a move, meaning `dp[ai]` should be `False` for all `ai` in `A`.

The correct approach would be to initialize `dp[i]` to `False` for all `i` and then update the table such that `dp[i]` is `True` if there exists any `x` in `A` such that `dp[i-x]` is `False`.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted([int(i) for i in input().split()])
    dp = [False] * (k + 1)
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        dp[i] = any(not dp[i - ai] for ai in a if i - ai >= 0)
    print('First' if dp[k] else 'Second')
```

This corrected version initializes `dp[i]` to `False` for all `i` and then updates it based on the condition that if there exists any `x` in `A` such that `dp[i-x]` is `False`, then `dp[i]` should be `True`.

However, the provided solution still contains the logical error mentioned above. Therefore, the provided program does not correctly implement the game logic and thus is incorrect.
