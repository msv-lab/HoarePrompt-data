Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads `N` and `K` from input, where `N` is the number of elements in the list `a`, and `K` is the initial number of stones in the pile.
   - It then reads the list `a` from input, which is a list of integers sorted in strictly increasing order such that `1 ≤ a_i ≤ K` for all `i` in range `N`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` of length `k + 1` with all elements set to `False`.
   - It sets `dp[ai]` to `True` for each element `ai` in `a`. This means that if a player can choose `ai` stones, the current state `i` can transition to `i - ai` stones, making the next state possible.

3. **DP Array Update**:
   - The program iterates from `max(a) + 1` to `k` and updates `dp[i]` to `True` if there exists at least one `ai` in `a` such that `dp[i - ai]` is `False`.
   - This step ensures that `dp[i]` is `True` if and only if there is no way to achieve the state `i` without making the opponent lose. This is a crucial part of determining the winning strategy.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - The program checks `dp[k]` to determine the winner. If `dp[k]` is `True`, it means Taro can force a win; otherwise, Jiro can force a win.
   - The program outputs 'First' if Taro wins and 'Second' if Jiro wins.

Given these steps, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given constraints and input format. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
