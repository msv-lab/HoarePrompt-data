You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a set A = \\{ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N \\} consisting of N positive integers. Taro and Jiro will play the following game against each other.

Initially, we have a pile consisting of K stones. The two players perform the following operation alternately, starting from Taro:

* Choose an element x in A, and remove exactly x stones from the pile.



A player loses when he becomes unable to play. Assuming that both players play optimally, determine the winner.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 100
* 1 \leq K \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_N \leq K

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
a_1 a_2 \ldots a_N


Output

If Taro will win, print `First`; if Jiro will win, print `Second`.

Program:
```
import os
from io import BytesIO

def func():
    input = BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    dp = [False] * (k + 1)
    for ai in a:
        dp[ai] = True
    for i in xrange(max(a) + 1, k + 1):
        dp[i] = any((not dp[i - ai] for ai in a))
    os.write(1, 'First' if dp[k] else 'Second')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in its dynamic programming approach. Specifically, the line `dp[ai] = True` sets `dp[ai]` to `True` for all `ai` in `a`, which incorrectly marks these positions as winning states. This misinterpretation leads to incorrect results for many test cases.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
2 5
2 3
```

According to the problem description, with `K = 5` and elements in set `A = {2, 3}`, Jiro should win because Taro's first move will leave either 3 or 2 stones, and Jiro can always force a win from there. However, the current implementation incorrectly marks these positions as winning states, leading to an incorrect output.

To fix this, the program should correctly implement the dynamic programming approach by marking states as winning or losing based on whether the opponent can force a win from the remaining stones. Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    dp = [False] * (k + 1)
    
    # Initialize base case
    dp[0] = True
    
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        dp[i] = any(not dp[i - ai] for ai in a if i - ai >= 0)
    
    os.write(1, 'First' if dp[k] else 'Second')

func()
```

This corrected version initializes the base case properly and checks all possible moves to determine if the current state is a winning or losing state.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `a`. It reads `N` and `K` from input, where `N` is the number of elements in the list `a` and `K` is an integer such that `1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5`. The list `a` is a list of integers sorted in strictly increasing order such that `1 ≤ a_i ≤ K` for all `i` in range `N`. The function constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` of length `k + 1` initialized to `False`. It then sets `dp[ai]` to `True` for each element `ai` in `a`. After that, it iterates from `max(a) + 1` to `k` and updates `dp[i]` to `True` if there exists at least one `ai` in `a` such that `dp[i - ai]` is `False`. Finally, the function writes 'First' to the output if `dp[k]` is `True`, otherwise it writes 'Second'. Potential edge cases include when `N` is 1 and `a` contains only one element, or when `K` is much larger than the maximum value in `a`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
