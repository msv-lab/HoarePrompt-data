Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in its dynamic programming approach. Specifically, the line `dp[ai] = True` sets `dp[ai]` to `True` for all `ai` in `a`, which incorrectly marks these positions as winning states. This misinterpretation leads to incorrect results for many test cases.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
2 5
2 3
```

According to the problem description, with `K = 5` and elements in set `A = {2, 3}`, Jiro should win because Taro's first move will leave either 3 or 2 stones, and Jiro can always force a win from there. However, the current implementation incorrectly marks these positions as winning states, leading to an incorrect output.

To fix this, the program should correctly implement the dynamic programming approach by marking states as winning or losing based on whether the opponent can force a win from the remaining stones. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    dp = [False] * (k + 1)
    
    # Initialize base case
    dp[0] = True
    
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        dp[i] = any(not dp[i - ai] for ai in a if i - ai >= 0)
    
    os.write(1, 'First' if dp[k] else 'Second')

func()
```

This corrected version initializes the base case properly and checks all possible moves to determine if the current state is a winning or losing state.
