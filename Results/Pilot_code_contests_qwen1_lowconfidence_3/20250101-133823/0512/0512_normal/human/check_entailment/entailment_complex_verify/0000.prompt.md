You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a set A = \\{ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N \\} consisting of N positive integers. Taro and Jiro will play the following game against each other.

Initially, we have a pile consisting of K stones. The two players perform the following operation alternately, starting from Taro:

* Choose an element x in A, and remove exactly x stones from the pile.



A player loses when he becomes unable to play. Assuming that both players play optimally, determine the winner.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 100
* 1 \leq K \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_N \leq K

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
a_1 a_2 \ldots a_N


Output

If Taro will win, print `First`; if Jiro will win, print `Second`.

    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())

    dp = [False] * (k + 1)
    for ai in a:
        dp[ai] = True

        dp[i] = any((not dp[i - ai] for ai in a))
    os.write(1, 'First' if dp[k] else 'Second')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program seems to be an attempt to solve the problem using dynamic programming. However, there is a logical error in the implementation of the dynamic programming table `dp`. Specifically, the line `dp[ai] = True` is setting `dp[ai]` to `True`, which is incorrect because it implies that if there are `ai` stones, the current player can always make a move. This is not true since the game ends when a player cannot make a move, meaning `dp[ai]` should be `False` for all `ai` in `A`.

The correct approach would be to initialize `dp[i]` to `False` for all `i` and then update the table such that `dp[i]` is `True` if there exists any `x` in `A` such that `dp[i-x]` is `False`.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted([int(i) for i in input().split()])
    dp = [False] * (k + 1)
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        dp[i] = any(not dp[i - ai] for ai in a if i - ai >= 0)
    print('First' if dp[k] else 'Second')
```

This corrected version initializes `dp[i]` to `False` for all `i` and then updates it based on the condition that if there exists any `x` in `A` such that `dp[i-x]` is `False`, then `dp[i]` should be `True`.

However, the provided solution still contains the logical error mentioned above. Therefore, the provided program does not correctly implement the game logic and thus is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import os
from io import BytesIO

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, K is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of integers sorted in strictly increasing order such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ K for all i in range N.
def func():
    input = BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    dp = [False] * (k + 1)
    for ai in a:
        dp[ai] = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is at least 1, `a` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in strictly increasing order, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` with all elements set to `True`.
    for i in xrange(max(a) + 1, k + 1):
        dp[i] = any(not dp[i - ai] for ai in a)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: dp is a list of length `k + 1` where `dp[i]` is `True` if and only if there exists at least one `ai` in `a` such that `dp[i - ai]` is `False`; `i` is `k + 1`; `a` is unchanged.
    os.write(1, 'First' if dp[k] else 'Second')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `a`. It reads `N` and `K` from input, where `N` is the number of elements in the list `a` and `K` is an integer such that `1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5`. The list `a` is a list of integers sorted in strictly increasing order such that `1 ≤ a_i ≤ K` for all `i` in range `N`. The function constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` of length `k + 1` initialized to `False`. It then sets `dp[ai]` to `True` for each element `ai` in `a`. After that, it iterates from `max(a) + 1` to `k` and updates `dp[i]` to `True` if there exists at least one `ai` in `a` such that `dp[i - ai]` is `False`. Finally, the function writes 'First' to the output if `dp[k]` is `True`, otherwise it writes 'Second'. Potential edge cases include when `N` is 1 and `a` contains only one element, or when `K` is much larger than the maximum value in `a`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
