Final: **False**

Reasoning: Although the original assessment correctly identified that the loop should start from `1` and go up to `n // 2 - 1` to ensure the fraction is proper, the current implementation in the provided program does not guarantee that the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction is found. The loop continues to print the first valid pair it finds, which might not necessarily be the maximum possible fraction. To ensure the program meets the problem description, the loop should be modified to print the last valid pair it finds, which would be the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction. 

Here is the corrected version:

```python
from fractions import gcd

def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_a, max_b = 0, 0
    for i in range(1, n // 2):
        if gcd(n - i, i) == 1:
            max_a, max_b = i, n - i
    print(max_a, max_b)
```

With this correction, the program will correctly identify and print the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction for the given sum `n`.
