You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya is a big fan of mathematics, especially its part related to fractions. Recently he learned that a fraction <image> is called proper iff its numerator is smaller than its denominator (a < b) and that the fraction is called irreducible if its numerator and its denominator are coprime (they do not have positive common divisors except 1).

During his free time, Petya thinks about proper irreducible fractions and converts them to decimals using the calculator. One day he mistakenly pressed addition button ( + ) instead of division button (÷) and got sum of numerator and denominator that was equal to n instead of the expected decimal notation. 

Petya wanted to restore the original fraction, but soon he realized that it might not be done uniquely. That's why he decided to determine maximum possible proper irreducible fraction <image> such that sum of its numerator and denominator equals n. Help Petya deal with this problem.

Input

In the only line of input there is an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 1000), the sum of numerator and denominator of the fraction.

Output

Output two space-separated positive integers a and b, numerator and denominator of the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction satisfying the given sum.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction whose numerator and denominator sum up to `n`. However, the logic used in the program may not always produce the correct output. Specifically, the program checks if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `i` and `n - i` is 1 for each `i` from 0 to `n/2` and prints the first pair that satisfies this condition. This approach does not guarantee finding the pair `(a, b)` that maximizes the fraction `a/b` while remaining proper and irreducible.

For instance, consider the input `n = 12`. According to the problem description, the expected output is `5 7`, which gives the fraction `5/7` (sum is 12, and it is a proper irreducible fraction). However, the program may return `1 11` because `gcd(1, 11) == 1` and the sum is 12, but `1/11` is not the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction.

To ensure correctness, the program needs to check all pairs `(i, n-i)` and verify that the fraction `i/(n-i)` is proper and irreducible, and among those, select the one with the highest value. The current implementation may miss the optimal pair due to the early termination when it finds the first valid pair.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func()` takes no parameters and operates on an integer `n` where \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\). It prints all pairs \((i, n - i)\) such that \(0 < i < n/2\) and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(i\) and \(n - i\) is 1. After executing the loop, the variable `n` remains unchanged, and the variable `i` will be set to `n/2`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
