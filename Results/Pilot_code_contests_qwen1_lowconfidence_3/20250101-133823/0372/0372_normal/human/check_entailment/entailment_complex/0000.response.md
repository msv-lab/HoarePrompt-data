Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction whose numerator and denominator sum up to `n`. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description Requirement**: 
   - The task is to find the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction \( \frac{a}{b} \) such that \( a + b = n \) and \( \frac{a}{b} \) is in its simplest form (i.e., \( \text{gcd}(a, b) = 1 \)) and \( a < b \).

2. **Current Implementation Issue**:
   - The program iterates through values of `i` from `0` to `n/2 - 1` and prints pairs \((i, n - i)\) where the greatest common divisor of `i` and `n - i` is 1.
   - However, the program does not ensure that the fraction \( \frac{i}{n - i} \) is proper (i.e., \( i < n - i \)).

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input `n = 12`.
     - The program would iterate through `i` values from 0 to 5.
     - For each `i`, it checks if `gcd(n - i, i) == 1`.
     - The pairs printed would be:
       - For `i = 1`: `gcd(11, 1) == 1` → prints `1 11`
       - For `i = 2`: `gcd(10, 2) == 2` → does not print
       - For `i = 3`: `gcd(9, 3) == 3` → does not print
       - For `i = 4`: `gcd(8, 4) == 4` → does not print
       - For `i = 5`: `gcd(7, 5) == 1` → prints `5 7`

   - While the pair `5 7` is indeed a proper irreducible fraction, it is not necessarily the maximum possible one.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The program should start from the largest possible value of `i` (i.e., `i = n // 2 - 1`) and decrease `i` until it finds a pair where both conditions (proper and irreducible) are met.
   - Specifically, it should ensure that \( i < n - i \) and \( \text{gcd}(i, n - i) == 1 \).

### Correct Implementation Example:
```python
from fractions import gcd

def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n // 2 - 1, 0, -1):
        if gcd(n - i, i) == 1 and i < n - i:
            print(str(i) + ' ' + str(n - i))
            break
```

This implementation ensures that the fraction is proper and irreducible, and it starts from the largest possible `i` to find the maximum possible fraction.
