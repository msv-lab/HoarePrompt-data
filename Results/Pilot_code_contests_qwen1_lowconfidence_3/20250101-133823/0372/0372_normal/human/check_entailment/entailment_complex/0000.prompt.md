You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Petya is a big fan of mathematics, especially its part related to fractions. Recently he learned that a fraction <image> is called proper iff its numerator is smaller than its denominator (a < b) and that the fraction is called irreducible if its numerator and its denominator are coprime (they do not have positive common divisors except 1).

During his free time, Petya thinks about proper irreducible fractions and converts them to decimals using the calculator. One day he mistakenly pressed addition button ( + ) instead of division button (÷) and got sum of numerator and denominator that was equal to n instead of the expected decimal notation. 

Petya wanted to restore the original fraction, but soon he realized that it might not be done uniquely. That's why he decided to determine maximum possible proper irreducible fraction <image> such that sum of its numerator and denominator equals n. Help Petya deal with this problem.

Input

In the only line of input there is an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 1000), the sum of numerator and denominator of the fraction.

Output

Output two space-separated positive integers a and b, numerator and denominator of the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction satisfying the given sum.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from fractions import gcd

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    for i in range(n / 2):
        if gcd(n - i, i) == 1:
            print(str(i) + ' ' + str(n - i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the conditions under which the loop operates.
    #
    #### Analysis of the Loop Code
    #The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n/2 - 1`. For each iteration, it checks if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `n - i` and `i` is 1. If it is, it prints `i` and `n - i`.
    #
    #### Initial Conditions
    #- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\).
    #- The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `n/2`.
    #
    #### Iterations and Conditions
    #1. **First Iteration (i = 0):**
    #   - Check `gcd(n - 0, 0) = gcd(n, 0)`, which is always 0. No output.
    #   
    #2. **Second Iteration (i = 1):**
    #   - Check `gcd(n - 1, 1) = gcd(n - 1, 1)`, which is 1 if and only if `n - 1` is coprime with 1. Always true, so print `1` and `n - 1`.
    #
    #3. **Third Iteration (i = 2):**
    #   - Check `gcd(n - 2, 2)`. This will depend on the value of `n`. If `n - 2` is odd, then `gcd(n - 2, 2) = 1` and it will print `2` and `n - 2`.
    #
    #4. **General Iteration (i = k):**
    #   - The loop continues to check `gcd(n - k, k)` and prints `k` and `n - k` if the gcd is 1.
    #
    #### Final Iteration and Termination
    #- The loop terminates when `i` reaches `n/2`.
    #- During the loop, the loop prints pairs `(i, n - i)` where `gcd(i, n - i) = 1`.
    #
    #### Conclusion
    #After all iterations, the loop will have printed all pairs `(i, n - i)` such that `0 < i < n/2` and `gcd(i, n - i) = 1`.
    #
    #### Output State
    #- The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\).
    #- The value of `i` after the loop finishes is `n/2` (since the loop runs from `0` to `n/2 - 1` and then stops).
    #
    #Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
    #
    #**Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 3 to 1000, `i` is `n/2`. All pairs `(i, n - i)` such that `0 < i < n/2` and `gcd(i, n - i) = 1` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func()` takes no parameters and operates on an integer `n` where \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\). It prints all pairs \((i, n - i)\) such that \(0 < i < n/2\) and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(i\) and \(n - i\) is 1. After executing the loop, the variable `n` remains unchanged, and the variable `i` will be set to `n/2`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
