Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find the maximum proper irreducible fraction by iterating through possible numerators and checking if the pair (i, n - i) is coprime. However, there is a critical issue in the loop condition and the logic inside the loop.

The loop should check for the largest possible numerator that is less than half of `n` because the fraction needs to be proper (numerator < denominator). The current loop starts from `0` to `n / 2`, which includes values that are not valid numerators since they would make the denominator larger or equal to the numerator, violating the proper fraction condition.

To fix this, the loop should start from `1` and go up to `n // 2 - 1` (since `n - 1` would not be a valid denominator for `1`):

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, n // 2):
        if gcd(n - i, i) == 1:
            print(str(i) + ' ' + str(n - i))
            return
```

This corrected version ensures that the numerator is always less than the denominator and checks for the greatest possible proper irreducible fraction. Without this fix, the program may miss valid fractions or include invalid ones.
