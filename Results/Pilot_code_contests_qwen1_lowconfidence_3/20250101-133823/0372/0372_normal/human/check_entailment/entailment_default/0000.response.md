Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The code attempts to find pairs \((i, n - i)\) such that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(i\) and \(n - i\) is 1, but it does not guarantee that the fraction \(\frac{i}{n-i}\) is the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction. 

For example, consider the input \(n = 12\):
- The output of the code is `5 7`, which is correct because \(\frac{5}{7}\) is a proper irreducible fraction and the sum of the numerator and denominator is 12.
- However, another possible pair is \(6 6\), which is not a proper fraction since the numerator is not smaller than the denominator. But the gcd of 6 and 6 is 6, not 1, so it is not considered.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the fraction is proper and irreducible. The code should iterate through possible values of \(i\) and check both conditions simultaneously. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_fraction = (1, n - 1)
    for i in range(1, n // 2):
        if n - i > i and gcd(i, n - i) == 1:
            max_fraction = (i, n - i)
    print(max_fraction[0], max_fraction[1])

from math import gcd
```

This corrected version ensures that the fraction is proper and irreducible by checking both conditions within the loop.
