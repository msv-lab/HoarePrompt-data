Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program attempts to find pairs of numbers `(i, n-i)` such that their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1 and prints the first pair that satisfies this condition. However, the problem requires finding the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction such that the sum of its numerator and denominator equals `n`.

Hereâ€™s why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Objective**: The program aims to find any pair `(i, n-i)` where `gcd(i, n-i) = 1`, but it does not ensure that the fraction formed by these numbers is the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction. It simply prints the first pair that meets the gcd condition, which may not necessarily be the maximum proper irreducible fraction.

2. **Missing Proper Fraction Check**: The program does not explicitly check whether the fraction formed by `(i, n-i)` is a proper fraction (i.e., `i < n-i`). A proper irreducible fraction should satisfy both conditions: `i < n-i` and `gcd(i, n-i) = 1`.

3. **Not Maximizing the Fraction**: The program does not guarantee that the printed fraction is the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction. For example, for `n = 12`, the correct output should be `5 7`, but the program might print other pairs like `1 11` or `2 10`, which are not the maximum proper irreducible fraction.

To fix the program, it needs to:
- Ensure the fraction is proper (`i < n-i`).
- Ensure the fraction is irreducible (`gcd(i, n-i) = 1`).
- Find the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction.

A corrected version would look something like this:

```python
from fractions import gcd

def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_a = 0
    max_b = 0
    for i in range(1, n // 2):
        if gcd(n - i, i) == 1:
            if i < n - i:
                if i > max_a:
                    max_a = i
                    max_b = n - i
    print(f"{max_a} {max_b}")
```

This corrected version ensures that the fraction is proper and irreducible while also being the maximum possible.
