Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly find the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction such that the sum of its numerator and denominator equals \( n \). The code simply prints all pairs \((i, n-i)\) where \(0 < i < n/2\) and \(\text{gcd}(i, n-i) == 1\). However, it does not ensure that the fraction is proper (\(i < n-i\)) and irreducible. 

For example, consider the input \( n = 12 \):
- The code would print several pairs, including \((5, 7)\), which is correct.
- However, it also prints \((6, 6)\), which is not proper because the numerator is not less than the denominator, even though \(\text{gcd}(6, 6) == 1\).

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that \(i < n-i\) before checking the gcd condition. Here is a corrected version:

```python
from fractions import gcd

def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, n // 2):
        if gcd(n - i, i) == 1:
            print(str(i) + ' ' + str(n - i))
            return
```

This ensures that the fraction is both proper and irreducible, and it stops after finding the first valid pair, which will be the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction.
