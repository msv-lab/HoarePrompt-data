Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction whose numerator and denominator sum up to `n`. However, the logic used in the program may not always produce the correct output. Specifically, the program checks if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `i` and `n - i` is 1 for each `i` from 0 to `n/2` and prints the first pair that satisfies this condition. This approach does not guarantee finding the pair `(a, b)` that maximizes the fraction `a/b` while remaining proper and irreducible.

For instance, consider the input `n = 12`. According to the problem description, the expected output is `5 7`, which gives the fraction `5/7` (sum is 12, and it is a proper irreducible fraction). However, the program may return `1 11` because `gcd(1, 11) == 1` and the sum is 12, but `1/11` is not the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction.

To ensure correctness, the program needs to check all pairs `(i, n-i)` and verify that the fraction `i/(n-i)` is proper and irreducible, and among those, select the one with the highest value. The current implementation may miss the optimal pair due to the early termination when it finds the first valid pair.
