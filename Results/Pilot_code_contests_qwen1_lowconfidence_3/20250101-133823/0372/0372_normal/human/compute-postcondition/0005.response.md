According to the code, the loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n/2 - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and the value of `n` is an integer in the range 3 to 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1, and it must still satisfy the condition that the GCD of (`n` - `i`, `i`) is 1.

Since `i` starts at 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must become 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer in the range 3 to 1000, `i` is 1**
