According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`.

- The loop starts from `i = 0` and goes up to `i < n / 2`.
- For the loop to execute, `n / 2` must be at least 1, which means `n` must be at least 2.

Given the condition that `3 <= n <= 1000`, we know that `n` is guaranteed to be an integer within this range. Therefore, `n / 2` will always be at least 1, ensuring that the loop can execute.

However, we need to specify the initial state of `i` before the loop starts. Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, we need to explicitly state that `i` is 0.

So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`n` is an integer in the range 3 to 1000, `i` is 0**
