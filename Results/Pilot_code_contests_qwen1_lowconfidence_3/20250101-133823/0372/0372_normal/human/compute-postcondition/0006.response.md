The code `print(str(i) + ' ' + str(n - i))` concatenates the string representation of `i` with a space and the string representation of `n - i`, and then prints it. The value of `i` remains unchanged, but now there is an additional print statement in the output.

Given the initial state where `n` is an integer in the range 3 to 1000, and `i` is 1, the code will execute as follows:

- `i` is 1.
- `n - i` will be `n - 1`.
- The print statement will output the string `1 (n - 1)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 3 to 1000, `i` is 1, and the print statement outputs '1 (n - 1)'**.
