The code prints the string concatenation of `i` and `n - i`. Since the values of `i` and `n` are known initially, we can directly substitute them into the print statement. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer in the range 3 to 1000, the print statement will output "0 (n-0)" which simplifies to "0 n".

However, the values of `i` and `n` themselves are not updated by this print statement. The gcd condition also remains valid as the print statement does not alter these values.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer in the range 3 to 1000, the gcd of (`n` - `i`, `i`) is 1, and the output of the print statement is "0 n"**
