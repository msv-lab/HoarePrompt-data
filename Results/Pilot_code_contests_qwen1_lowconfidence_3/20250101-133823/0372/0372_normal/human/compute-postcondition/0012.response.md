The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the function definition `def func():`. The parameter constraint mentioned (n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000) seems to be irrelevant since no parameter named `n` is present in the function signature.

Given the output cases, the function should handle some internal logic based on the constraint but does not accept any external parameters.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a value based on an internal integer `n` where 3 <= n <= 1000.**
