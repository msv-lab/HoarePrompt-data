Functionality: **The function `func()` takes no parameters and operates on an integer `n` where \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\). It prints all pairs \((i, n - i)\) such that \(0 < i < n/2\) and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(i\) and \(n - i\) is 1. After executing the loop, the variable `n` remains unchanged, and the variable `i` will be set to `n/2`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \(n\) is even, the loop will run until `i` equals `n/2`.
- If \(n\) is odd, the loop will run until `i` is one less than `n/2`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code assumes the existence of a `gcd` function, which is not explicitly defined in the provided code. Therefore, the functionality relies on the presence of a valid `gcd` function that correctly computes the greatest common divisor of two integers.
