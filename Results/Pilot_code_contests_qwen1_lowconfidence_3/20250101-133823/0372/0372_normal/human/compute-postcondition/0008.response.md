According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `n / 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an integer in the range 3 to 1000, and `i` is 1. 

The loop body does not change the values of `n` or `i` directly. It only prints something if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `(n - i)` and `i` is 1. If the gcd is not 1, no output is generated, but `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` starts from 1 and increases by 1 each iteration.
- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n / 2`.

Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n / 2`. Given that `i` will be 2 in the next iteration, `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is an integer in the range 3 to 1000, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 4**
