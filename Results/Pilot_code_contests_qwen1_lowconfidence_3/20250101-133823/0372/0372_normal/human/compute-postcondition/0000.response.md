The code `n = int(raw_input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `raw_input()` returns a string, the `int()` function converts this string to an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 1000`. After executing the code, the value of `n` will be the integer input provided by the user, which must still satisfy the condition `3 <= n <= 1000`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided by the user, and it satisfies the condition 3 <= n <= 1000**.
