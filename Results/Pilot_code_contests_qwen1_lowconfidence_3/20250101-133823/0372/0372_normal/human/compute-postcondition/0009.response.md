The code prints the string formed by concatenating the string representation of `i` and `n - i`. Since `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer in the range 3 to 1000 (and `n` must be greater than 4), `n - i` will be an integer between 1 and 998. However, the values of `n` and `i` themselves do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer in the range 3 to 1000, `i` is 2, and the output is printed as a string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 3 to 1000, `i` is 2, and the output is printed as a string '2' + ' ' + str(n - 2)**
