Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 3 to 1000, `i` is 1. If the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `(n - i)` and `i` is 1, the print statement outputs '1 (n - 1)' and no change is made to `n` and `i`. Since there is no else part, if the gcd is not 1, no output is generated and `n` and `i` remain unchanged.***
