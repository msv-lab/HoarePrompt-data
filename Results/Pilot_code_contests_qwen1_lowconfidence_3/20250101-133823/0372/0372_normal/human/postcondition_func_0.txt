The function `func()` takes no parameters and operates on an integer `n` where \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\). It prints all pairs \((i, n - i)\) such that \(0 < i < n/2\) and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(i\) and \(n - i\) is 1. After executing the loop, the variable `n` remains unchanged, and the variable `i` will be set to `n/2`.
