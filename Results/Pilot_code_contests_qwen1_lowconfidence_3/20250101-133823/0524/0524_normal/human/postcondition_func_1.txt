The function `func_2` reads an integer input from the user representing the order of the rhombus (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and returns this integer value. The function does not perform any additional checks on the input other than reading it. Therefore, it is up to the caller to ensure that the input is within the specified range. If the user inputs a value outside the range (less than 1 or greater than 100), the function will still return that value, which could lead to incorrect behavior in subsequent operations.
