The function `func_12` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are integers, and `p` is a positive integer representing a modulus. The function calculates `x` raised to the power `y` modulo `p` using the method of repeated squaring. After executing the loop, the function returns the value of `res`, which is the result of the calculation. However, due to a missing reference in the code (`p1` instead of `p`), the function will always use `p` for the modulo operation. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `res` holds the result of `x^y mod p`. Since the function always returns `res` and the annotations suggest it returns 1, it implies that the initial value of `res` is set to 1, and the loop updates `res` based on the repeated squaring of `x` modulo `p`. The function does not handle the case where `y` is 0; in such a case, the function should return `res` which would be 1 because the initial value of `res` is 1 and no further updates are made.
