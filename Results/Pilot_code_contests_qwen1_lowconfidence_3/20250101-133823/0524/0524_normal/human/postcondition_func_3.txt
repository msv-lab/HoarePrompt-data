The function `func_4` accepts no parameters and returns a list. This list is generated by converting the result of `func_3()` into a list. The purpose of `func_4` is to provide a list representation of the output from `func_3()`. If `func_3()` returns an iterable (e.g., generator, set, tuple), `func_4` will convert it into a list. No additional processing is performed on the elements of the iterable before conversion.
