Postcondition: ***`at_start` is False, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `sys.stdout` has `b' ' + str(next_x) + b' '` written to it since the condition `not at_start` is always true and there is no else part.***
