The code writes the value of `sep` to `file`. Since `sep` is `b' '`, `file.write(b' ')` is executed. This changes the content of `file` (which is `sys.stdout`), but does not affect the values of other variables.

Output State: **`kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, the value of `at_start` is false, the content of `sys.stdout` has `b' '` appended to it.**
