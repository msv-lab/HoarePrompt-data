The code assigns default values to `sep` and `file` if they are not provided. Specifically, `sep` is assigned the value `b' '`, which is a byte string representing a single space, and `file` is assigned the value `sys.stdout`, which is the standard output stream. The `kwargs` dictionary has its elements popped, meaning that any key-value pairs related to `sep` and `file` are removed from `kwargs`.

Output State: **`kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`**
