`file.flush()` is called, which flushes the buffer of `sys.stdout`. Since `sys.stdout` was previously set to have the concatenated string of all elements in `args` separated by `b' '` followed by `b'\n'` written to it, the buffer is flushed, meaning the contents are written to the actual file or device immediately.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state: `kwargs` no longer contains the keys `'sep'` and `'file'`, `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `at_start` is `False`, `sys.stdout` now reflects the state after the buffer has been flushed, and `flush` is `False` (since it was popped from `kwargs` with a default value of `False`).

Output State: **`kwargs` no longer contains the keys `'sep'` and `'file'`, `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `at_start` is `False`, `sys.stdout` has the concatenated string of all elements in `args` separated by `b' '` followed by `b'\n'` and the buffer has been flushed, `flush` is `False`.**
