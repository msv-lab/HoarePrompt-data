`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is `b' '`), to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). This operation does not change the values of `kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, or `args`. Therefore, the only change is that `sys.stdout` has had its content updated.

Output State: **`kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `sys.stdout` has `b' '` written to it**
