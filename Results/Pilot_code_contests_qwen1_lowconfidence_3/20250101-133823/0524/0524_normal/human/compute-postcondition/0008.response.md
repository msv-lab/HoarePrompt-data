`at_start` is assigned the value `False`. This changes the value of `at_start` from its initial state (which was `True` according to the precondition) to `False`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `at_start` is `False`.**
