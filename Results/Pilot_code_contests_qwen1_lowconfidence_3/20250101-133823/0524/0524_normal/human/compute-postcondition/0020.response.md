The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))` does the following:
1. It attempts to remove the key `'end'` from the `kwargs` dictionary using `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')`. Since `kwargs` no longer contains the keys `'sep'` and `'file'`, it will not affect the `kwargs` dictionary.
2. It writes the value associated with the key `'end'` (or `b'\n'` if the key does not exist) to `sys.stdout`.

Given the initial state:
- `kwargs` no longer contains the keys `'sep'` and `'file'`.
- `sep` is `b' '`.
- `file` is `sys.stdout`.
- `args` is a non-empty iterable.
- `at_start` is `False`.
- `sys.stdout` has the concatenated string of all elements in `args` separated by `b' '` written to it.

Since `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'`, `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')` will return `b'\n'`. This value is then written to `sys.stdout`.

Output State: **`kwargs` no longer contains the keys `'sep'` and `'file'`, `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `at_start` is `False`, `sys.stdout` has the concatenated string of all elements in `args` separated by `b' '` followed by `b'\n'` written to it.**
