The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It is unrelated to the problem of calculating the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus and does not use any input parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_16` is to not accept any parameters and return an unspecified value (since no specific return value is mentioned).

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns an unspecified value.**
