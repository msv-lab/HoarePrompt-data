According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop iterates over each element in `args`, and as long as `args` is not empty, the loop continues to execute.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are true:
- `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file'
- `sep` is `b' '` (the separator)
- `file` is `sys.stdout` (the output file)
- `args` is a non-empty iterable (since the loop was able to iterate at least once)

For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still be a non-empty iterable. After the current iteration, `args` will contain one less element than it did at the start of the current iteration. Therefore, `args` will still be a non-empty iterable if it had more than one element to begin with.

To summarize:
- `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file'
- `sep` remains `b' '` (the separator)
- `file` remains `sys.stdout` (the output file)
- `args` is now an iterable with one less element (non-empty if it had more than one element before)

State: **`kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable**
