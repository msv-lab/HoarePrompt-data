`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is `b' '`), to `sys.stdout`. This does not change the value of `sep`, `file`, `args`, or `at_start`. The output state is updated to reflect that `sys.stdout` now contains `b' ' + str(next_x) + b' '`, since it had `b' ' + str(next_x)` before and now has `b' '` appended to it.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `sys.stdout` has `b' ' + str(next_x) + b' '` written to it.**
