Functionality: **The function `func_14` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\). It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, if `n` is less than or equal to 3 and not 2 or 3, or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3 and greater than 3. If none of these conditions are met, it returns `True`. The function uses a loop to check divisibility up to the square root of `n`, skipping multiples of 2 and 3.**

**Edge Cases:**
- The function returns `False` for \(n \leq 1\).
- The function returns `True` for \(n = 2\) and \(n = 3\).
- The function returns `False` for even numbers and multiples of 3 greater than 3.
- The function returns `True` for prime numbers between 5 and 97 that are not divisible by 2 or 3.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where `n` is exactly 4 or 6, which should return `False` based on the annotations and logical flow of the code. However, since the actual code correctly handles these cases within the initial checks, no additional action is needed in the summary.
