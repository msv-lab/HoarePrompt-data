Postcondition: ***`kwargs` no longer contains the keys `'sep'` and `'file'`, `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `at_start` is `False`, `sys.stdout` has the concatenated string of all elements in `args` separated by `b' '` followed by `b'\n'` written to it, and if `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, the buffer has been flushed. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `False`, the buffer remains unchanged.***
