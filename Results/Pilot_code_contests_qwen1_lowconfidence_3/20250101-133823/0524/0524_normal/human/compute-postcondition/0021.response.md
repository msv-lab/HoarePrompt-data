Postcondition: **`kwargs` no longer contains the keys `'sep'` and `'file'`, `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `at_start` is `False`, `sys.stdout` has the concatenated string of all elements in `args` separated by `b' '` followed by `b'\n'` written to it, the value of `flush` is popped from `kwargs` with a default value of `False`.**
