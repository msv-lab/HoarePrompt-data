Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

1. **Current State:**
   - `at_start` is False
   - `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file'
   - `sep` is `b' '`
   - `file` is `sys.stdout`
   - `args` is a non-empty iterable
   - `sys.stdout` has `b' ' + str(x)` written to it (where `x` is the current element being processed in the loop)

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for x in args:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `args`.
   - For each iteration, `x` takes the next value from `args`.
   - `sys.stdout` writes `b' ' + str(x)` to it.

4. **State Adjustments for Next Iteration:**
   - Since `args` is a non-empty iterable, the loop can execute as long as there are elements left in `args`.
   - After processing the current element `x`, `args` will have one less element.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still contain at least one element.
   - `at_start` remains `False` because the loop has already started.
   - `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', so this state does not change.
   - `sep` remains `b' '` because the value of `sep` is not affected by the loop itself.
   - `file` remains `sys.stdout` because the value of `file` is not affected by the loop itself.
   - `sys.stdout` will write `b' ' + str(next_x)` where `next_x` is the next element in `args`.

Given these points, the state adjustments needed for the next iteration of the loop are:

State: **`at_start` is False, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `sys.stdout` has `b' ' + str(next_x)` written to it.**

Note: `next_x` represents the next element in the `args` iterable.
