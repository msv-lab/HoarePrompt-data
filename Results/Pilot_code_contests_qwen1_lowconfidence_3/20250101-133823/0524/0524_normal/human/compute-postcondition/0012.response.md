`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `sys.stdout`. Since `sys.stdout` had `b' '` written to it before, and now `file.write(str(x))` is called, it will write the string representation of `x` to `sys.stdout`. The values of `kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, and `args` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `sys.stdout` has `b' ' + str(x)` written to it.**
