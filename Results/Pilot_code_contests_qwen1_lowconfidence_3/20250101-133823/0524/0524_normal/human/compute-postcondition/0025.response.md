Functionality: **The function `func_16` accepts no parameters and returns an unspecified value. It writes a sequence of items (from `args`) to `sys.stdout` separated by a space (`b' '`), followed by a newline (`b'\n'`). If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, it flushes the buffer. However, the function does not accept any keyword arguments (`kwargs`) and does not handle cases where `kwargs` might contain other unexpected keys. Additionally, the function does not account for the case where `args` is empty, which would result in no output being written to `sys.stdout`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `args` is empty, no output is written to `sys.stdout`.
- If `kwargs` contains unexpected keys, those keys are ignored and do not affect the output.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not validate or process the contents of `args` beyond converting them to strings and writing them to `sys.stdout` with a separator.
- There is no handling for cases where `args` might be `None` or contain non-convertible types to strings.
