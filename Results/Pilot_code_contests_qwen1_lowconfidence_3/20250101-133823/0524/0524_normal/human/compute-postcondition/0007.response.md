The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file object referenced by `file`. Since `file` is initially set to `sys.stdout`, the string representation of `x` will be written to `sys.stdout`. However, the value of `x` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot specify its exact value in the output state.

Given the initial state, the following changes occur:
- `sys.stdout` will now include the string representation of `x` appended to it.
- `kwargs`, `sep`, and `file` remain unchanged because `write` does not modify these variables directly.
- `args` remains unchanged because `write` does not interact with `args`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and the content of `sys.stdout` has the string representation of `x` appended to it if `at_start` is false. If `at_start` is true, the original state of `kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, and `args` is preserved.**
