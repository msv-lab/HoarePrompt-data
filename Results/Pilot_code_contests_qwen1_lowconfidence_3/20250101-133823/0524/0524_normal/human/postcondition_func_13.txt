The function `func_14` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\). It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, if `n` is less than or equal to 3 and not 2 or 3, or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3 and greater than 3. If none of these conditions are met, it returns `True`. The function uses a loop to check divisibility up to the square root of `n`, skipping multiples of 2 and 3.
