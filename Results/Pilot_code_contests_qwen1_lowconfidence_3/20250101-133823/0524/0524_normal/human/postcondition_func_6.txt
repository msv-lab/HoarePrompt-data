The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `l`, which is a list of integers. It returns a new list that is sorted based on the key determined by the function `getKey` applied to each element in the list `l`. The sorting is performed using the built-in `sorted` function in Python. If `getKey` is not defined or does not exist, the function will raise a `NameError`. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but one potential edge case is if `getKey` returns the same value for all elements in the list, resulting in the original order being preserved. Another edge case is if `getKey` raises an exception when called on any element in the list, which would cause the function to fail.
