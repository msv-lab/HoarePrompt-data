Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_15` calculates the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus, but the logic inside the loop is incorrect. The problem description asks for the number of cells in a rhombus, and the formula to calculate this is \(4n^2 - 4\). However, the code inside the loop is not implementing this correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the relevant part of `func_15`:

```python
def func_15():
    n = func_1()
    if n == 1:
        func_16(1)
    else:
        ans = 4 * n * n - 4
        func_16(ans)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly compute the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus as \(4n^2 - 4\). The current implementation in the original code is not following the problem description accurately, hence the correctness is **False**.
