Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly compute the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. The function `func_15` attempts to solve the problem but does not implement the correct logic. The output hints further confirm that `func_16` is not relevant to the problem and simply prints values to `sys.stdout` without addressing the core requirement of computing the number of cells in a rhombus. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
