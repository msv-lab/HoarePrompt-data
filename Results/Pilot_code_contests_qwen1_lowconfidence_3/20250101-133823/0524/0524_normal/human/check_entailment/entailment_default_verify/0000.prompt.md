You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While playing with geometric figures Alex has accidentally invented a concept of a n-th order rhombus in a cell grid.

A 1-st order rhombus is just a square 1 × 1 (i.e just a cell).

A n-th order rhombus for all n ≥ 2 one obtains from a n-1-th order rhombus adding all cells which have a common side with it to it (look at the picture to understand it better).

<image>

Alex asks you to compute the number of cells in a n-th order rhombus.

Input

The first and only input line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — order of a rhombus whose numbers of cells should be computed.

Output

Print exactly one integer — the number of cells in a n-th order rhombus.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. According to the description, a 1st-order rhombus has 1 cell, a 2nd-order rhombus has 5 cells, and a 3rd-order rhombus has 13 cells. However, the function `func_15` attempts to solve this problem but does not implement the correct logic.

To solve this problem, we can observe the pattern:
- A 1st-order rhombus has \(1\) cell.
- A 2nd-order rhombus adds 4 more cells around the initial 1, making it \(1 + 4 = 5\).
- A 3rd-order rhombus adds another layer of 8 cells around the 2nd-order rhombus, making it \(5 + 8 = 13\).

The number of additional cells added at each step follows the pattern \(4, 8, 12, \ldots\), which is \(4k\) for the k-th step after the initial cell.

The correct formula to calculate the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus is:
\[ \text{Number of cells} = n^2 + 2n(n-1) = n^2 + 2n^2 - 2n = 3n^2 - 2n + 1 \]

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def number_of_cells_in_rhombus(n):
    return 3 * n * n - 2 * n + 1

# Function to read input and print output
def main():
    n = int(input())
    print(number_of_cells_in_rhombus(n))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected program will handle the problem correctly for all inputs within the given constraints.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 16 : The function `func_16` accepts no parameters and returns an unspecified value. It writes a sequence of items (from `args`) to `sys.stdout` separated by a space (`b' '`), followed by a newline (`b'\n'`). If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, it flushes the buffer. However, the function does not accept any keyword arguments (`kwargs`) and does not handle cases where `kwargs` might contain other unexpected keys. Additionally, the function does not account for the case where `args` is empty, which would result in no output being written to `sys.stdout`.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
