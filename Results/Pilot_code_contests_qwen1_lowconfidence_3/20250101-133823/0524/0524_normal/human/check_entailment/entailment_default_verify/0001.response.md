Final: **False**

Reasoning: Although the original assessment correctly identified that the program calculates the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus, the function `func_16` is responsible for printing the result, and there are issues with its implementation that affect the overall correctness. Specifically, `func_16` does not actually calculate the number of cells; instead, it appears to be a placeholder or an incomplete function. Moreover, `func_16` is called without any parameters, yet it seems to depend on the variable `ans`, which is not defined within `func_16`. 

Given that `func_15` is the function that computes the number of cells, and `func_16` is intended to print the result, the current implementation of `func_16` does not serve its intended purpose. This makes the program incorrect based on the problem description, as the output should be the number of cells calculated by `func_15`.

The output hints further confirm this issue, stating that `func_16` does not accept any parameters and does not handle the cases where `kwargs` might contain unexpected keys or where `args` is empty. Therefore, the program cannot produce the expected output as described in the problem statement.

Hence, the original assessment cannot be maintained, and the program should be considered incorrect.
