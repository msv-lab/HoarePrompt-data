Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. The function `func_15` computes the number of cells using the formula derived from the pattern observed in the problem description. For each order n, the number of cells follows a specific mathematical relationship, and the program accurately implements this logic.

To verify, let's consider the first few orders:
- For \( n = 1 \), the rhombus is a 1x1 square, so the number of cells is 1.
- For \( n = 2 \), the rhombus expands to include additional cells around the initial 1x1 square, resulting in 5 cells.
- For \( n = 3 \), the rhombus further expands, and the number of cells becomes 13.

The provided function `func_15` correctly handles these cases and generalizes the calculation for any \( n \) up to 100. Since the program accurately follows the problem description and handles all tested cases correctly, the correctness is **True**.
