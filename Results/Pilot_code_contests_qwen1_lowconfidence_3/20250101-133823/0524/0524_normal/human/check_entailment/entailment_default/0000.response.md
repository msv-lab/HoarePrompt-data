Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code in `func_15` does not correctly calculate the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. According to the problem description, the function should calculate the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. However, the implementation in `func_15` calculates `ans` in a way that does not align with the definition of a rhombus as described.

The function `func_15` initializes `r` to 1 and `ans` to 1, and then iterates from 2 to `n`, updating `r` and `ans` in each iteration. Specifically, it calculates `m` as `(r - 2) * (r - 2) % (ans - 4)`, updates `r` to `r + 2`, and updates `ans` to `ans + 4 + m`. After the loop, it calls `func_16(ans)`.

This approach does not correctly represent the structure of a rhombus as defined in the problem. A more accurate calculation would involve summing up the number of cells in each layer of the rhombus, which increases by 4 for each subsequent layer starting from 1.

For example, for `n = 1`, the correct number of cells is 1, and for `n = 2`, the correct number of cells is 5. However, the provided implementation does not correctly calculate these values.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the correctness is **False**.
