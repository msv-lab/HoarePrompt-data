Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code in `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. Specifically, the function `func_15` calculates a value based on a different formula, which does not match the required logic for calculating the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus.

To understand why this is incorrect, let's consider the problem description and the provided examples:

1. For \( n = 1 \):
   - A 1st-order rhombus is a 1x1 square, so the number of cells is 1.
   - The code correctly calls `func_16(1)` for \( n = 1 \).

2. For \( n = 2 \):
   - A 2nd-order rhombus is formed by adding cells around a 1st-order rhombus, resulting in 5 cells.
   - The code should calculate the number of cells as \( 5 \) for \( n = 2 \).

3. For \( n = 3 \):
   - A 3rd-order rhombus is formed similarly, resulting in 13 cells.
   - The code should calculate the number of cells as \( 13 \) for \( n = 3 \).

However, the code in `func_15` does not correctly calculate the number of cells for \( n > 1 \). Specifically, the logic inside the loop does not match the required formula for calculating the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. The formula for the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus is \( n^2 + (n-1)^2 \).

Here is the corrected version of the code for `func_15`:

```python
def func_15():
    n = func_1()
    if n == 1:
        func_16(1)
    else:
        ans = n**2 + (n-1)**2
        func_16(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus is correctly calculated and passed to `func_16`.

Since the provided code does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus, the correctness is **False**.
