Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. Let's analyze why:

### Problem Description:
To find the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus, the structure can be observed as follows:
- A 1st order rhombus consists of 1 cell.
- A 2nd order rhombus consists of 5 cells (the center cell plus 4 additional cells around it).
- A 3rd order rhombus consists of 13 cells, and so on.

The pattern can be observed as:
\[ \text{Cells in } n\text{-th order rhombus} = 2n^2 - 2n + 1 \]

### Analysis of Provided Code:
1. **Function `func_15`**:
   - It reads the input `n` using `func_1()`.
   - If `n == 1`, it calls `func_16(1)`.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `r` and `ans` and uses a loop to compute something, but the computations are not consistent with the formula \(2n^2 - 2n + 1\).

2. **Loop in `func_15`**:
   - The loop iterates from 2 to `n`, computing `r` and `ans` in a way that does not match the expected formula.
   - Specifically, `r = r * r % ans` and `ans += 4 + m` do not reflect the correct computation for the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus.

3. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The values `r` and `ans` are updated in a manner that does not align with the mathematical formula for the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus.
   - The final `func_16(ans)` call does not pass the correct value of cells for the n-th order rhombus.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should directly compute the number of cells using the formula \(2n^2 - 2n + 1\) and print the result. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func_15():
    n = int(input())
    # Calculate the number of cells in the n-th order rhombus
    cells = 2 * n**2 - 2 * n + 1
    # Print the result
    print(cells)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not follow the problem description because it does not correctly compute the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus using the given formula. Therefore, the program is incorrect and the output will not match the expected results for all valid inputs.
