You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While playing with geometric figures Alex has accidentally invented a concept of a n-th order rhombus in a cell grid.

A 1-st order rhombus is just a square 1 × 1 (i.e just a cell).

A n-th order rhombus for all n ≥ 2 one obtains from a n-1-th order rhombus adding all cells which have a common side with it to it (look at the picture to understand it better).

<image>

Alex asks you to compute the number of cells in a n-th order rhombus.

Input

The first and only input line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — order of a rhombus whose numbers of cells should be computed.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. According to the description, a 1st-order rhombus has 1 cell, a 2nd-order rhombus has 5 cells, and a 3rd-order rhombus has 13 cells. However, the function `func_15` attempts to solve this problem but does not implement the correct logic.

To solve this problem, we can observe the pattern:
- A 1st-order rhombus has \(1\) cell.
- A 2nd-order rhombus adds 4 more cells around the initial 1, making it \(1 + 4 = 5\).
- A 3rd-order rhombus adds another layer of 8 cells around the 2nd-order rhombus, making it \(5 + 8 = 13\).

The number of additional cells added at each step follows the pattern \(4, 8, 12, \ldots\), which is \(4k\) for the k-th step after the initial cell.

The correct formula to calculate the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus is:
\[ \text{Number of cells} = n^2 + 2n(n-1) = n^2 + 2n^2 - 2n = 3n^2 - 2n + 1 \]

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def number_of_cells_in_rhombus(n):
    return 3 * n * n - 2 * n + 1

# Function to read input and print output
def main():
    n = int(input())
    print(number_of_cells_in_rhombus(n))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected program will handle the problem correctly for all inputs within the given constraints.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input provided by the user, within the range of 1 to 100
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer input from the user and returns it. The returned integer must be within the range of 1 to 100. If the user provides an input outside this range, the function will continue to prompt the user until a valid integer within the specified range is entered.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no input variable in the function signature provided, but the function is expected to read an integer input from the user representing the order of the rhombus (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns an integer input from the user representing the order of the rhombus (1 ≤ n ≤ 100)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer input from the user representing the order of the rhombus (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and returns this integer value. The function does not perform any additional checks on the input other than reading it. Therefore, it is up to the caller to ensure that the input is within the specified range. If the user inputs a value outside the range (less than 1 or greater than 100), the function will still return that value, which could lead to incorrect behavior in subsequent operations.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no input related to this function. The function does not take any parameters and does not use the variables m or n mentioned in the problem description. Instead, it reads an integer input representing the order of the rhombus from the standard input.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object created from the integer input provided by the user, assuming the input is a single integer separated by spaces and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads an integer input from the standard input, assuming the input is a single integer value (potentially with leading or trailing whitespace). It then converts this input into a map object, which is essentially a space-separated string of integers converted into a map. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a list or tuple of integers directly; instead, it returns a map object. This means that the output can be used further in the program by iterating over the map object. If the input does not match the expected format (i.e., it contains multiple numbers or non-integer values), the behavior is undefined because the `map` function will attempt to convert each part of the split string into an integer, potentially raising a `ValueError`.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no direct information about variables in the function signature for `func_4`, but based on the problem description, `func_3` returns a value or iterable that is used to compute the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus.
def func_4():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list computed from func_3()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts no parameters and returns a list. This list is generated by converting the result of `func_3()` into a list. The purpose of `func_4` is to provide a list representation of the output from `func_3()`. If `func_3()` returns an iterable (e.g., generator, set, tuple), `func_4` will convert it into a list. No additional processing is performed on the elements of the iterable before conversion.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no direct information about variables in the function signature provided. However, based on the problem description, we can infer that the function does not take any parameters and its purpose is to compute the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus.
def func_5():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
    threading.stack_size(40960000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5()` does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. Instead, it configures the system settings for recursion limit and thread stack size, then starts a new thread to execute the `main` function. After the thread starts, the function ends, leaving the program state dependent on the execution of the `main` function within the new thread. Potential edge cases include setting the recursion limit and stack size to very high values, which could lead to performance issues or crashes if the `main` function causes excessive recursion or uses too much stack space. The function does not perform any calculations or return any results; its primary action is to initiate a new thread.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: item is a list or tuple containing at least one element, where the first element is of any type.
def func_6(item):
    return item[0]
    #The program returns the first element of the list or tuple 'item', which is of any type
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `item`, which is expected to be a non-empty list or tuple. The function returns the first element of `item`, which can be of any type. If `item` is an empty list or tuple, the function will raise an `IndexError` since accessing the first element using `item[0]` would be invalid in such a case. Therefore, the function should check if `item` is non-empty before attempting to access its first element to avoid raising an error.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers.
def func_7(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey)
    #The program returns a list that is sorted based on the key determined by the function getKey applied to each element in list 'l'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `l`, which is a list of integers. It returns a new list that is sorted based on the key determined by the function `getKey` applied to each element in the list `l`. The sorting is performed using the built-in `sorted` function in Python. If `getKey` is not defined or does not exist, the function will raise a `NameError`. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but one potential edge case is if `getKey` returns the same value for all elements in the list, resulting in the original order being preserved. Another edge case is if `getKey` raises an exception when called on any element in the list, which would cause the function to fail.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers representing dimensions of a 2D list, and num is an integer value to fill in the 2D list. However, for the specific problem of calculating the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus, n is the order of the rhombus and m and num are not used and can be ignored.
def func_8(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #The program returns a 2D list with 'n' rows and 'm' columns, where each cell contains the value 'num'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a 2D list (a list of lists) with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each cell in the list is filled with the value `num`. The function creates and returns this 2D list by using a nested list comprehension. The values of `m` and `num` are not utilized within the function; therefore, they can be considered irrelevant for the function's core operation. However, the function will still accept these parameters as part of its signature. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities noted in the provided code, as it correctly implements the intended behavior described in the annotations.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100.
def func_9(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns False if x is not a power of 2, and True if x is a power of 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts a positive integer `x` within the range of 1 to 100. It checks whether `x` is a power of 2. If `x` is not a power of 2, the function returns `False`; if `x` is a power of 2, the function returns `True`. The function uses the bitwise operation `x & (x - 1)` to determine if `x` is a power of 2. This operation results in `0` if `x` is a power of 2, and non-zero otherwise. Therefore, the function effectively checks if `x & (x - 1)` equals `0`.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: 
def func_10(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns the binary representation of 'n' without the '0b' prefix
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts an integer `n` as a parameter and returns its binary representation as a string, without the '0b' prefix. The function correctly converts the integer to binary using the `bin()` function and then removes the '0b' prefix using the `replace` method. There are no potential edge cases or missing functionality in the provided code.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
def func_11(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the original integer n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to 100 and returns a list of its digits. The function converts the integer `n` into a string, then iterates over each character in the string, converting it back to an integer and adding it to a list. This list is then returned. The function handles the case where `n` is a two-digit number, a one-digit number, or the boundary values (1 and 100). However, it does not handle cases where `n` is outside the specified range 1 to 100, which would result in a ValueError when attempting to convert `n` to a string using the list comprehension.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers, and p is a positive integer representing a modulus.
def func_12(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `res` is 1, `x` is the result of repeated squaring of the initial `x` modulo `p1`.
    return res
    #The program returns 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are integers, and `p` is a positive integer representing a modulus. The function calculates `x` raised to the power `y` modulo `p` using the method of repeated squaring. After executing the loop, the function returns the value of `res`, which is the result of the calculation. However, due to a missing reference in the code (`p1` instead of `p`), the function will always use `p` for the modulo operation. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `res` holds the result of `x^y mod p`. Since the function always returns `res` and the annotations suggest it returns 1, it implies that the initial value of `res` is set to 1, and the loop updates `res` based on the repeated squaring of `x` modulo `p`. The function does not handle the case where `y` is 0; in such a case, the function should return `res` which would be 1 because the initial value of `res` is 1 and no further updates are made.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers, and y is non-zero.
def func_13(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is 0, `y` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`
    return x
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, where both are non-negative integers and `y` is non-zero. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing the algorithm, the function returns 0.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100.
def func_14(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 < n <= 100
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 < n <= 100 and n > 3
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 < n <= 100 and n > 3, and n is not divisible by 2 and n is not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 100\), \(n > 3\), and \(n\) is not divisible by 2 and 3, and \(n\) is not less than \((i + 6k)^2\) for \(k\) being the number of iterations that occurred; \(i` is incremented by 6 with each iteration and is at least 5 after all iterations; the loop returns `False` if any \(i\) within the range \(1 \leq i \leq \sqrt{n}\) satisfies either \(n \% i == 0\) or \(n \% (i + 2) == 0\).
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\). It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, if `n` is less than or equal to 3 and not 2 or 3, or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3 and greater than 3. If none of these conditions are met, it returns `True`. The function uses a loop to check divisibility up to the square root of `n`, skipping multiples of 2 and 3.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100.
def func_15():
    n = func_1()
    if (n == 1) :
        func_16(1)
    else :
        r = 1
        ans = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            m = r * r % ans
            
            r += 2
            
            ans += 4 + m
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is not equal to 1, `r` is `2n - 1`, `ans` is `n^2 - 1`, `i` is `n`, `m` is `(r - 2) * (r - 2) % (ans - 4)`
        func_16(ans)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100. If `n` equals 1, then `n` remains 1. Otherwise, `n` is not 1, and the values of `r`, `ans`, `i`, and `m` are as follows: `r = 2n - 1`, `ans = n^2 - 1`, `i = n`, `m = (r - 2) * (r - 2) % (ans - 4)`. Additionally, `func_16(ans)` has been called.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_15` takes no explicit input parameters but relies on the value returned by `func_1()`. It calculates a value based on the input `n` and calls another function `func_16()` with the calculated value. The function processes `n` as follows:
- If `n` is 1, it calls `func_16(1)`.
- If `n` is greater than 1, it initializes `r` to 1 and `ans` to 1. It then iterates from 2 to `n`, updating `r` and `ans` in each iteration. Specifically, it calculates `m` as `(r - 2) * (r - 2) % (ans - 4)`, updates `r` to `r + 2`, and updates `ans` to `ans + 4 + m`. After the loop, it calls `func_16(ans)`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes will be:
- If `n` is 1, `func_16(1)` is called.
- If `n` is greater than 1, `func_16(n^2 - 1)` is called, where `n` is the input to the function, and `r` is set to `2n - 1`, `ans` is set to `n^2 - 1`, and `m` is `(r - 2) * (r - 2) % (ans - 4)`.

Potential edge case: The function assumes that the input `n` is an integer between 1 and 100. If `n` is outside this range, the behavior is not specified in the provided code or annotations.

Missing functionality: The code does not handle the case where `n` is less than 1 or greater than 100 explicitly. If `func_1()` returns a value outside this range, the function may produce unexpected results.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_16` relate to the problem of calculating the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. The function `func_16` is unrelated to the problem description and does not use any of the input parameters described in the problem.
def func_16():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', b' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `at_start` is `False`, `sys.stdout` has the concatenated string of all elements in `args` separated by `b' '` written to it.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`kwargs` no longer contains the keys `'sep'` and `'file'`, `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `at_start` is `False`, `sys.stdout` has the concatenated string of all elements in `args` separated by `b' '` followed by `b'\n'` written to it, and if `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, the buffer has been flushed. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `False`, the buffer remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` accepts no parameters and returns an unspecified value. It writes a sequence of items (from `args`) to `sys.stdout` separated by a space (`b' '`), followed by a newline (`b'\n'`). If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, it flushes the buffer. However, the function does not accept any keyword arguments (`kwargs`) and does not handle cases where `kwargs` might contain other unexpected keys. Additionally, the function does not account for the case where `args` is empty, which would result in no output being written to `sys.stdout`.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
