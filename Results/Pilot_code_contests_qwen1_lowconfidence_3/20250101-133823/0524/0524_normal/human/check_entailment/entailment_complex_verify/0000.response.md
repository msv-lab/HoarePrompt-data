Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the annotated version of the code, the function `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. The provided code and annotations indicate that `func_15` attempts to solve the problem through an incorrect approach. Specifically, the function calculates values that do not correspond to the actual number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. 

The correct formula for the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus is \(3n^2 - 2n + 1\), as derived from the pattern described in the problem statement. The function `func_15` does not use this formula, leading to incorrect results. For example, for \(n = 1\), the correct number of cells is 1, but the function returns 1, which is correct in this case, but for \(n = 2\), the correct number of cells is 5, and the function incorrectly calculates a different value.

Given that the annotated version confirms the original assessment, the program does not meet the problem description. Therefore, the final assessment is **False**.
