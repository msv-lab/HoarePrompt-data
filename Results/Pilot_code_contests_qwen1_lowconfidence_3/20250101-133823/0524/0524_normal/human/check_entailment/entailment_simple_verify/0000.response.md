Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly compute the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. Based on the annotated version of the code, we can see that `func_15` is the primary function responsible for calculating the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. However, the logic implemented in `func_15` is flawed and does not follow the correct mathematical pattern for calculating the number of cells.

The annotated version clarifies that `func_15` attempts to compute the number of cells by incrementing a value `r` and adjusting another value `ans` in a manner that does not align with the known formula for the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. Specifically, the correct formula is \(3n^2 - 2n + 1\), but the code does not implement this formula. Instead, it uses a different approach that does not correctly account for the incremental addition of cells in each step.

Therefore, based on the annotations and the problem description, the program does not meet the requirements and thus the original assessment is accurate.
