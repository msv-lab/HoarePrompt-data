Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identified that the program is correct. Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, we can see that the program is designed to calculate the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus, which matches the problem description. Specifically:

1. The function `func_15` correctly handles the input `n` and uses it to compute the number of cells in the rhombus.
2. The computation inside `func_15` follows the pattern observed in the problem description, where each new order of the rhombus adds a specific number of cells to the previous order.
3. The annotated version confirms that `func_15` iterates from 2 to `n`, updating the number of cells (`ans`) and the radius (`r`) according to the formula derived from the problem's pattern.
4. The function `func_16` simply prints the result, which is consistent with the problem's requirement to output the number of cells.

Given that the annotated version supports the correctness of the program's implementation and the original assessment aligned with this understanding, the final assessment remains **True**.
