The function `func_5()` does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. Instead, it configures the system settings for recursion limit and thread stack size, then starts a new thread to execute the `main` function. After the thread starts, the function ends, leaving the program state dependent on the execution of the `main` function within the new thread. Potential edge cases include setting the recursion limit and stack size to very high values, which could lead to performance issues or crashes if the `main` function causes excessive recursion or uses too much stack space. The function does not perform any calculations or return any results; its primary action is to initiate a new thread.
