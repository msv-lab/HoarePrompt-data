The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a 2D list (a list of lists) with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each cell in the list is filled with the value `num`. The function creates and returns this 2D list by using a nested list comprehension. The values of `m` and `num` are not utilized within the function; therefore, they can be considered irrelevant for the function's core operation. However, the function will still accept these parameters as part of its signature. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities noted in the provided code, as it correctly implements the intended behavior described in the annotations.
