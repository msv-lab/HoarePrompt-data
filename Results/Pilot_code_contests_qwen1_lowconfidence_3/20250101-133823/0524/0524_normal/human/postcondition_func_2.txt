The function `func_3` reads an integer input from the standard input, assuming the input is a single integer value (potentially with leading or trailing whitespace). It then converts this input into a map object, which is essentially a space-separated string of integers converted into a map. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a list or tuple of integers directly; instead, it returns a map object. This means that the output can be used further in the program by iterating over the map object. If the input does not match the expected format (i.e., it contains multiple numbers or non-integer values), the behavior is undefined because the `map` function will attempt to convert each part of the split string into an integer, potentially raising a `ValueError`.
