The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to 100 and returns a list of its digits. The function converts the integer `n` into a string, then iterates over each character in the string, converting it back to an integer and adding it to a list. This list is then returned. The function handles the case where `n` is a two-digit number, a one-digit number, or the boundary values (1 and 100). However, it does not handle cases where `n` is outside the specified range 1 to 100, which would result in a ValueError when attempting to convert `n` to a string using the list comprehension.
