The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `item`, which is expected to be a non-empty list or tuple. The function returns the first element of `item`, which can be of any type. If `item` is an empty list or tuple, the function will raise an `IndexError` since accessing the first element using `item[0]` would be invalid in such a case. Therefore, the function should check if `item` is non-empty before attempting to access its first element to avoid raising an error.
