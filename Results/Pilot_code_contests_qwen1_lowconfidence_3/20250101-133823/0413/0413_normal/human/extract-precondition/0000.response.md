Precondition: **The input consists of four lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers n and bx (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ bx ≤ 40), where n is the number of digits in the bx-based representation of X. The second line contains n space-separated integers x1, x2, ..., xn (0 ≤ xi < bx) — the digits of X. The third line contains two space-separated integers m and by (1 ≤ m ≤ 10, 2 ≤ by ≤ 40, bx ≠ by), where m is the number of digits in the by-based representation of Y. The fourth line contains m space-separated integers y1, y2, ..., ym (0 ≤ yi < by) — the digits of Y. There will be no leading zeroes, and both X and Y will be positive. All digits of both numbers are given in the standard decimal numeral system.**
