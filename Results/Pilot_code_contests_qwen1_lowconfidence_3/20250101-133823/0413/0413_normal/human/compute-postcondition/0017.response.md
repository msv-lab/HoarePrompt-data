The code `by = int(s[1])` assigns the value of `s[1]` converted to an integer to the variable `by`. This means that `by` now holds the integer value of whatever was in `s[1]`. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `bx`, `x`, `m`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`s` is updated to the list obtained from the input, `n` is a non-negative integer, `bx` is the integer value of `s[1]`, `x` is the base `bx` representation of the number represented by the list `s[2:]`, `m` is the value of `s[0]`, `by` is the integer value of `s[1]`**
