Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `i` is `m - 1`
- `m` is a non-negative integer
- `a` is the integer value of `ys[0]`
- `y` is `by`

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The for loop iterates over the range from `m - 1` down to `-1` in steps of `-1`. This means it starts from `m - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`.

### End of Previous Iteration:
At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m - 1`.

### Next Iteration:
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented from `m - 1` to `m - 2`.

### Updated States:
- Since `i` was `m - 1` and the loop decrements `i` by 1, `i` will now be `m - 2`.
- The condition `m` being a non-negative integer remains unchanged.
- The value of `a` (which is the integer value of `ys[0]`) remains unchanged.
- The value of `y` (which is `by`) remains unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `m - 2`, `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the integer value of `ys[0]`, `y` is `by`**
