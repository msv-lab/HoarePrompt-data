The code reads the input using `raw_input().split(' ')`, which splits the input string into a list of strings based on spaces. Since the initial state provides the input format, the values of `n`, `bx`, `m`, `by`, `X` (as a list of digits in the original base `bx`), and `Y` (as a list of digits in the original base `by`) are not directly accessible from the code alone, but they are split into a list of strings. 

Let's denote the split result as `s`, which will be a list of strings corresponding to the input provided. The values of `n`, `bx`, `m`, `by`, `X`, and `Y` remain unchanged but are now represented within the list `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a list containing the split input strings ['n', 'bx', 'm', 'by', 'X1', 'X2', ..., 'Xn', 'Y1', 'Y2', ..., 'Ym']**
