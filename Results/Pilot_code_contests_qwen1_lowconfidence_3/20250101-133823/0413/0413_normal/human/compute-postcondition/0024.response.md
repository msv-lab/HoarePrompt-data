The code assigns the value of `ys[m - 1 - i]` to `a`. Given the initial state, `i` is `m - 2`, and `m` is a non-negative integer. So, substituting `i` in the expression `m - 1 - i` gives `m - 1 - (m - 2)`, which simplifies to `1`. Therefore, `a` is assigned the value of `ys[1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Hence, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `m - 2`, `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the value of `ys[1]`, `y` is `by`**
