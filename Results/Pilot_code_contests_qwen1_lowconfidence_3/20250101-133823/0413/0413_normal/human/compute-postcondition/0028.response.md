`y` is updated to `y + by ** (i * a)`. Given the initial state where `i` is `m - 3`, `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is `int(ys[2])`, and `y` is `y + by`, the value of `i` becomes `m - 3`, `a` remains `int(ys[2])`, and the new value of `y` is the previous value of `y` plus `by` raised to the power of `(i * a)`.

Output State: **`i` is `m - 3`, `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is `int(ys[2])`, `y` is the previous value of `y` + `by ** (i * a)`**
