Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variable and its range**: The loop variable `i` is initialized with the value `n - 1` and decremented by 1 until it reaches -1. This means the loop will run from `n-1` down to 0.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0 (since the loop runs from `n-1` down to 0).
   - The loop variable `i` should start at `n-1`.

3. **Consider the given states**:
   - `s` is a list starting with 'n', followed by other elements.
   - `n` is the integer value of the string 'n' in the list `s`.
   - `bx` is the integer value of `s[1]`.
   - `x` is 0.
   - `xs` is the list resulting from splitting `user_input` by spaces.

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - Since `n` is the integer value of the string 'n' in the list `s`, we need to ensure that this value is correctly extracted and is greater than 0.
   - The loop starts with `i` at `n-1`, so `i` should be set to `n-1` initially.

Given these points, the necessary adjustments are:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` should be set to `n-1`.

The state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`s` is a list starting with 'n', followed by other elements, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`**.
