The code snippet `print(ans)` does not modify any of the variables. It simply prints the value of the variable `ans`. Since no new operations are performed, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is -1, `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the integer value of `ys[m]`, `y` is the sum of all elements in `ys` converted from base `by`, and `ans` is set to either '=' if `x` equals `y`, '>' if `x` is greater than `y`, or '<' if `x` is less than or equal to `y`. The value of `ans` is printed.**
