Output State: **`i` is `-1`, `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the integer value of `ys[m]`, `y` is the sum of all elements in `ys` converted from base `by`.** 

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs in reverse order from `m-1` to `0` (inclusive). It converts each element of `ys` from the index `m-1` down to `0` into an integer and adds it to `y` after multiplying by the appropriate power of `by`.

2. **Termination Condition**: The loop will continue until `i` reaches `-1`. At this point, all elements of `ys` from `m-1` to `0` have been processed.

3. **Final Value of `y`**: After the loop completes, `y` will hold the sum of all elements in `ys` when interpreted as a number in base `by`. The variable `a` will be the last element in `ys` (i.e., `ys[m]`) since `i` starts from `m-1` and decrements to `-1`.

4. **Case Where Loop Does Not Execute**: If `m` is `0`, the loop will not execute because the range `range(m-1, -1, -1)` would be empty. In this case, `y` remains `0`.

Thus, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the final state is that `i` is `-1`, `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the integer value of `ys[m]`, and `y` is the sum of all elements in `ys` when interpreted as a number in base `by`.
