`a` is assigned the value of `ys[m - 1 - i]`. Given that `i` is `m - 3`, we can substitute `i` in the expression to get `a = int(ys[m - 1 - (m - 3)])`, which simplifies to `a = int(ys[2])`.

The value of `m` remains a non-negative integer, and the values of `y` and `by` are updated to `y + by`, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, the updated value of `y` is `y + by`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `m - 3`, `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is `int(ys[2])`, `y` is `y + by`**
