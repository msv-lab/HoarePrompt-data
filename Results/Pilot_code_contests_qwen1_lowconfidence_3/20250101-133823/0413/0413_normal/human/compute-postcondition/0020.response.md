Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variable and Range**: The loop variable `i` is defined in the range `range(m - 1, -1, -1)`. This means `i` starts from `m-1` and decrements to `-1`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: At the start of the loop, `i` should be `m-1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`. Therefore, `i` must start from `m-1` and decrement until it reaches `-1`.

4. **Check the Given States**:
   - `s` is a list of strings from the input.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `bx` is the integer value of `s[1]`.
   - `x` is the base `bx` representation of the number represented by the list `s[2:]`.
   - `m` is the value of `s[0]`.
   - `by` is the integer value of `s[1]`.
   - `y` is 0.
   - `ys` is a list of strings from the input.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` starts from `m-1` for the loop to begin.
   - `m` is the starting point for `i`, so it must be a valid non-negative integer (since `n` is a non-negative integer and we assume `s[0]` is a valid non-negative integer).

Given these points, the required adjustments are:

- `i` should be set to `m-1` at the start of the loop.
- `m` should be a valid non-negative integer.

The final state after adjustment would be:

State: **`i` is `m-1`, `m` must be a non-negative integer**
