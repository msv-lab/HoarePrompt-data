Functionality: **The function reads two numbers \(X\) and \(Y\) from the user input, where \(X\) is represented in base \(bx\) and \(Y\) is represented in base \(by\). The function then converts both numbers from their respective bases to base 10 and compares them. Based on the comparison, it prints either '<', '=', or '>' indicating whether \(X\) is less than, equal to, or greater than \(Y\) respectively. The function handles the following edge cases: both inputs are valid (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10, 2 ≤ bx, by ≤ 40, bx ≠ by), no leading zeroes, and the digits are within the valid range (0 ≤ xi, yi < bx, by). If the input does not meet these criteria, the function may produce unexpected results.**
