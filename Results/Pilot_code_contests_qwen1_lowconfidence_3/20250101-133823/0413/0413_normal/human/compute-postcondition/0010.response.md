Let's go through the code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `s` is a list starting with 'n', followed by other elements.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n-2`.
   - `a` is the integer value of `s[1]`.
   - `x` is equal to `x + b * (n-1) * n`.

2. Code to be executed:
   ```python
   x = x + b * x ** i * a
   ```

3. Impact Analysis:
   - The variable `x` is updated based on its current value, the value of `b`, the value of `i`, and the integer value of `s[1]` (which is `a`).
   - The new value of `x` is the sum of its old value and `b * x ** i * a`.

4. Calculation:
   - Substitute the known values into the equation:
     - `x` is currently `x + b * (n-1) * n` (from the initial state).
     - `i` is `n-2`.
     - `a` is the integer value of `s[1]`.

   So, the new value of `x` is:
   ```
   x = (x + b * (n-1) * n) + b * (x + b * (n-1) * n) ** (n-2) * a
   ```

5. Output State:
   - The list `s` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `i` remains `n-2`.
   - `a` remains the integer value of `s[1]`.
   - `x` is updated to the value calculated above.

Output State: **`s` is a list starting with 'n', followed by other elements, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-2`, `a` is the integer value of `s[1]`, `x` is `(x + b * (n-1) * n) + b * (x + b * (n-1) * n) ** (n-2) * a`.**
