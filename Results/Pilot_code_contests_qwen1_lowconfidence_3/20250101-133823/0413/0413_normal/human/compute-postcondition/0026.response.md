According to the code, the for loop iterates from `m - 1` down to `-1` in steps of `-1`. This means the loop starts with `i` set to `m - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 until it reaches `-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `i` is `m - 2`
- `m` is a non-negative integer
- `a` is the value of `ys[1]`
- `y` is updated to `y + by`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, making it `m - 3`. The value of `m` remains unchanged since the loop condition does not depend on `m`. The value of `a` and `y` remain as they were updated in the previous iteration.

State: **`i` is `m - 3`, `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the value of `ys[1]`, `y` is updated to `y + by`**
