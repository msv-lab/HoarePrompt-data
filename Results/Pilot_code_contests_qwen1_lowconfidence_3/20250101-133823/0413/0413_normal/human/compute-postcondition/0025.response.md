`y` is assigned the value of `y + by ** (i * a)`. Given that `i` is `m - 2`, `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the value of `ys[1]`, and `y` is `by`, we substitute these values into the equation. The value of `i` is `m - 2`, so the expression becomes `y = y + by ** ((m - 2) * a)`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `m - 2`, `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the value of `ys[1]`, `y` is updated to `y + by ** ((m - 2) * a)`**
