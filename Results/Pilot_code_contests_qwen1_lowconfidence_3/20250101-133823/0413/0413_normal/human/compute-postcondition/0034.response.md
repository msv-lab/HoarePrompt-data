`ans` is assigned the value `'>'`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `m`, `a`, `y`, and `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is -1, `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the integer value of `ys[m]`, `y` is the sum of all elements in `ys` converted from base `by`, `x` is greater than `y`, and `ans` is '>'.
