The code `a = int(ys[m - 1 - i])` assigns the value of `ys[m - 1 - i]` (converted to an integer) to the variable `a`. Given the initial state where `i` is `m - 1` and `m` is a non-negative integer, let's calculate the value of `a`.

1. The expression `m - 1 - i` simplifies to `m - 1 - (m - 1)` which is `0`.
2. So, `a` is assigned the value of `ys[0]` (since `m - 1 - i` results in `0`).
3. No changes are made to `i` or `m`.

Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `m - 1`, `m` is a non-negative integer, and `a` is the integer value of `ys[0]`.

Output State: **`i` is `m - 1`, `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the integer value of `ys[0]`**
