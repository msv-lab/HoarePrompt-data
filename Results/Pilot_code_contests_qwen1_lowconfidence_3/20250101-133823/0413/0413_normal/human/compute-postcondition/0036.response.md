`ans` is assigned the value `'<''`. The other variables (`i`, `m`, `a`, `y`, and `x`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `ans` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`i` is -1, `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the integer value of `ys[m]`, `y` is the sum of all elements in `ys` converted from base `by`, `x` is less than or equal to `y`, `ans` is '<'**
