The code assigns the value `'='` to the variable `ans`. This assignment does not affect the values of `i`, `m`, `a`, `y`, or `x`. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`i` is `-1`, `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the integer value of `ys[m]`, `y` is the sum of all elements in `ys` converted from base `by`, the current value of `x` is equal to `y`, and `ans` is `'='`.**
