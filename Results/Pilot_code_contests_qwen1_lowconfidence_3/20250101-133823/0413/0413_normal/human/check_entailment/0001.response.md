Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `bx` and `by` are the same. In the provided solution, the program checks if `x` is equal to `y`, greater than `y`, or less than `y`. However, it does not account for the scenario where `bx` equals `by`. This could lead to incorrect results if the bases are the same but the numbers differ. For example, if `bx = by` and the digits of `X` and `Y` are the same but in a different order, the program would not correctly identify this as a case where `X` is equal to `Y`.
