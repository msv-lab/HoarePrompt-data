Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly compare the numbers \(X\) and \(Y\) in their respective bases. While the code correctly converts the numbers from their given bases to base 10, it then directly compares the decimal values without properly accounting for the base representations. This means that even if the decimal values are equal, the original base representations might still differ, especially when considering the positional values and the radix of the bases.

For example, consider the following input:

```
6 2
1 0 1 1 1 1
2 10
4 7
```

The output should be `=`, as both numbers are equivalent in decimal when converted from their respective bases. However, the provided code correctly handles this case and outputs `=`.

However, consider another case:

```
3 3
1 0 2
2 5
2 4
```

Here, \(X = 102_3 = 1 \cdot 3^2 + 0 \cdot 3^1 + 2 \cdot 3^0 = 9 + 0 + 2 = 11_{10}\).

And \(Y = 24_5 = 2 \cdot 5^1 + 4 \cdot 5^0 = 10 + 4 = 14_{10}\).

In this case, \(X < Y\), but the provided code would incorrectly output `<` because it simply compares the decimal values, which do not reflect the original base representations accurately.

Therefore, the code fails to correctly compare the numbers in their respective bases and should be marked as incorrect.
