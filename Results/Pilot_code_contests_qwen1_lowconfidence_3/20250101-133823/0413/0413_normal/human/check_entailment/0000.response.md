Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the input bases `bx` and `by` are equal. According to the problem description, `bx` and `by` should always be different. However, the program does not include any checks to ensure this condition is met. If `bx` equals `by`, the program will still attempt to convert the numbers and compare them, which may lead to incorrect results. 

For example, if `bx` and `by` are both 10, the program will still execute without raising an error, but it will not fulfill the requirement of ensuring `bx` and `by` are different. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
