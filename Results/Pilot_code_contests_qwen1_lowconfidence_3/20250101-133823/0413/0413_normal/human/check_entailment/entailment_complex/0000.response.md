Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input in the specified format, where it first reads the number of digits `n` and the base `bx` for the first number \(X\), followed by the digits of \(X\). It then reads the number of digits `m` and the base `by` for the second number \(Y\), followed by the digits of \(Y\).

2. **Base Conversion**: The program correctly converts the numbers \(X\) and \(Y\) from their respective bases to base 10. For \(X\), it iterates through its digits from the most significant to the least significant, multiplying each digit by \(bx\) raised to the appropriate power and adding it to the total. The same process is done for \(Y\).

3. **Comparison**: After converting both numbers to base 10, the program compares the values of \(X\) and \(Y\). It correctly sets the variable `ans` to `>` if \(X > Y\), `<` if \(X < Y\), and `=` if \(X = Y\).

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the result as required by the problem statement.

Given that the problem description specifies valid inputs (no leading zeroes, valid ranges for bases and digits, etc.), and the program handles these inputs correctly without producing unexpected results, the program is correct according to the problem description.
