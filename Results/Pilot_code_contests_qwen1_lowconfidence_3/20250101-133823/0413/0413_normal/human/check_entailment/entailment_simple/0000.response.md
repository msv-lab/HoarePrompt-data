Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the first line to get `n` and `bx`, and parses the next line to get the digits of `X` in base `bx`.
   - It then reads the next line to get `m` and `by`, and parses the following line to get the digits of `Y` in base `by`.

2. **Conversion to Decimal:**
   - The program correctly converts the number `X` from its base `bx` representation to its decimal form using the formula `x = x + bx ** i * a` for each digit.
   - Similarly, it converts the number `Y` from its base `by` representation to its decimal form using the same formula.

3. **Comparison and Output:**
   - The program compares the decimal values of `X` and `Y`.
   - Based on the comparison, it sets `ans` to `'='` if `X` equals `Y`, `'>'` if `X` is greater than `Y`, and `'<'` if `X` is less than `Y`.
   - Finally, it prints the appropriate character.

Given the problem description and the code provided, the program adheres to the following key points:
- It reads the input as specified (two lines for `X` and two lines for `Y`).
- It converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal accurately.
- It compares the decimal values and outputs the correct character ('<', '>', or '=').

Since the program meets all the requirements and handles all potential valid cases without any issues, the program is correct.
