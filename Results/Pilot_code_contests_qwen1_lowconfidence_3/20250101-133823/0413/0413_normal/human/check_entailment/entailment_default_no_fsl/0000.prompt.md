You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: After seeing the "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US" meme for the first time, numbers X and Y realised that they have different bases, which complicated their relations.

You're given a number X represented in base bx and a number Y represented in base by. Compare those two numbers.

Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and bx (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ bx ≤ 40), where n is the number of digits in the bx-based representation of X. 

The second line contains n space-separated integers x1, x2, ..., xn (0 ≤ xi < bx) — the digits of X. They are given in the order from the most significant digit to the least significant one.

The following two lines describe Y in the same way: the third line contains two space-separated integers m and by (1 ≤ m ≤ 10, 2 ≤ by ≤ 40, bx ≠ by), where m is the number of digits in the by-based representation of Y, and the fourth line contains m space-separated integers y1, y2, ..., ym (0 ≤ yi < by) — the digits of Y.

There will be no leading zeroes. Both X and Y will be positive. All digits of both numbers are given in the standard decimal numeral system.

Output

Output a single character (quotes for clarity): 

  * '<' if X < Y
  * '>' if X > Y
  * '=' if X = Y

Note

In the first sample, X = 1011112 = 4710 = Y.

In the second sample, X = 1023 = 215 and Y = 245 = 1123, thus X < Y.

In the third sample, <image> and Y = 48031509. We may notice that X starts with much larger digits and bx is much larger than by, so X is clearly larger than Y.
Program:
```
def func():
    s = raw_input().split(' ')
    n = int(s[0])
    bx = int(s[1])
    x = 0
    xs = raw_input().split(' ')
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        a = int(xs[n - 1 - i])
        x = x + bx ** i * a
    s = raw_input().split(' ')
    m = int(s[0])
    by = int(s[1])
    y = 0
    ys = raw_input().split(' ')
    for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
        a = int(ys[m - 1 - i])
        y = y + by ** i * a
    if x == y:
        ans = '='
    elif x > y:
        ans = '>'
    else:
        ans = '<'
    print(ans)


```
Output hints: The function reads two numbers \(X\) and \(Y\) from the user input, where \(X\) is represented in base \(bx\) and \(Y\) is represented in base \(by\). The function then converts both numbers from their respective bases to base 10 and compares them. Based on the comparison, it prints either '<', '=', or '>' indicating whether \(X\) is less than, equal to, or greater than \(Y\) respectively. The function handles the following edge cases: both inputs are valid (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10, 2 ≤ bx, by ≤ 40, bx ≠ by), no leading zeroes, and the digits are within the valid range (0 ≤ xi, yi < bx, by). If the input does not meet these criteria, the function may produce unexpected results.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
