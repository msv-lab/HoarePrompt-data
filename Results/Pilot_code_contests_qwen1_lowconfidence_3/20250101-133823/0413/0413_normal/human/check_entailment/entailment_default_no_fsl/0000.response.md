Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads two numbers \(X\) and \(Y\) from the user input, where \(X\) is represented in base \(bx\) and \(Y\) is represented in base \(by\). The code then converts both numbers from their respective bases to base 10 and compares them, printing the appropriate character ('<', '=', '>') based on the comparison. The code handles the specified edge cases, including the range of digits and bases, and correctly processes the input as described in the problem description and output hints. There are no apparent issues or missing cases that would cause the program to fail under the given constraints.
