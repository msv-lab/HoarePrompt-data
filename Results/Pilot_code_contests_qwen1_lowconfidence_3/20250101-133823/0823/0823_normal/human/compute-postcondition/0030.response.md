The code appends the string `'4'` to the list `tem`. The previous value of `tem` was `['7']`, so after appending, `tem` becomes `['7', '4']`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a3` and `a4` are integers such that \(1 \leq a3 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq a4 \leq 10^6\), `i` is either 2 or 3, `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`, `tem` is a list containing `['7', '4']`, `tem2` is a list containing `['7', '5']`, `four2` is 5, `seven` is 1 more than its original unspecified value, and if `i` is 2, `seven2` is its original value + 1.**
