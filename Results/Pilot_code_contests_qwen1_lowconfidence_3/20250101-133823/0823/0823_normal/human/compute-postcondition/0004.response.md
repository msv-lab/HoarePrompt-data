The code assigns the value `['4']` to the variable `tem` and the value `['7']` to the variable `tem2`. The variables `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4`, and `a` are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`a1`, `a2`, `a3`, and `a4` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` ≤ 10^6; `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`. The absolute difference between `a3` and `a4` is less than or equal to 1; `tem` is `['4']`; `tem2` is `['7']`.**
