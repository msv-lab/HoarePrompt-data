The code snippet `tem.append('7')` appends the string `'7'` to the list `tem`. The list `tem` was initially `['4']`, so after appending `'7'`, `tem` becomes `['4', '7']`.

All other variables are not affected by this operation. The condition `(i & 1)` being false remains unchanged, as it does not rely on the values of `tem`.

Output State: **`a3` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a3 \leq 10^6\), `a4` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a4 \leq 10^6\), `i` is 0, `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`, `tem` is `['4', '7']`, `tem2` is `['7']`, `four` is 1, `seven` is 0, `four2` is 0, `seven2` is 1, the condition `(i & 1)` is false**
