The code appends the string '4' to the list `tem`. The previous value of `i` is 1, but this does not affect the lists `tem` and `tem2` directly. The lists `four`, `seven`, `four2`, and `seven2` are not mentioned in the code snippet, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a3` and `a4` are integers such that \(1 \leq a3 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq a4 \leq 10^6\), `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`, `tem` is a list containing `['4']`, `tem2` is a list where each element is either '4' or '7', `four`, `seven`, `four2`, and `seven2` are unchanged.**
