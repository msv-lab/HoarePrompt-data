`tem2` is a list that initially contains `['7', '5']`. The code snippet appends `'4'` to `tem2`. Therefore, the new value of `tem2` will be `['7', '5', '4']`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`a3` and `a4` are integers such that \(1 \leq a3 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq a4 \leq 10^6\), `i` is either 2 or 3, `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`, `tem` is a list containing `['7', '7']`, `tem2` is a list containing `['7', '5', '4']`, `four2` is 5, `seven` is 1 more than its original unspecified value, and if `i` is 2, `seven2` is its original value + 1.**
