`four` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `four` is not specified. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is: `i` is 2, `a` is `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`, `tem` is `['4']`, `tem2` is `['4', '7']`, and `four` is `four + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `a` is `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`, `tem` is `['4']`, `tem2` is `['4', '7']`, `four` is `four + 1`**
