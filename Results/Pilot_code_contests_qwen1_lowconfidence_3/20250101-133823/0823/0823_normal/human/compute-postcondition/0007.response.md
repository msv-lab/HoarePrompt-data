To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop itself:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < a[2] + a[3]`.
   - This means the loop will run as long as `i` is less than the value of `a[2] + a[3]`.

2. **Given States**:
   - `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` are integers such that \(1 \leq a1, a2, a3, a4 \leq 10^6\).
   - `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`.
   - The absolute difference between `a3` and `a4` is less than or equal to 1.
   - `tem` is `['4']`.
   - `tem2` is `['7']`.
   - `four` is 1.
   - `seven` is 0.
   - `four2` is 0.
   - `seven2` is 1.

3. **Determine Loop Execution Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, `a[2] + a[3]` must be greater than 0.
   - Since `a[2]` is `a3` and `a[3]` is `a4`, the condition becomes \(a3 + a4 > 0\).

4. **Additional States to Adjust**:
   - `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 with each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the loop, `i` should be 0.
   - We don't need to adjust the values of `tem`, `tem2`, `four`, `seven`, `four2`, and `seven2` because they do not affect the loop's execution directly.

Given the above analysis, we need to ensure that `a3 + a4 > 0` and `i` is 0 at the start of the loop.

**State:**
- **`a3` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a3 \leq 10^6\) and \(a4\) is an integer such that \(1 \leq a4 \leq 10^6\)** (ensuring \(a3 + a4 > 0\)).
- **`i` is 0**.
- **`a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`** (this remains unchanged but is included for completeness).
- **`tem` is `['4']`**.
- **`tem2` is `['7']`**.
- **`four` is 1**.
- **`seven` is 0**.
- **`four2` is 0**.
- **`seven2` is 1**.

So, the final state to ensure the loop can execute is:

State: **`a3` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a3 \leq 10^6\) and \(a4\) is an integer such that \(1 \leq a4 \leq 10^6\), `i` is 0, `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`, `tem` is `['4']`, `tem2` is `['7']`, `four` is 1, `seven` is 0, `four2` is 0, `seven2` is 1**.
