Postcondition: ***`a3` and `a4` are integers such that \(1 \leq a3 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq a4 \leq 10^6\), `i` is either \(a3 + a4 - 1\) or \(a3 + a4\), `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`, `tem` is a list of length \(a3 + a4\) where each element alternates between '4' and '7' starting with '7' if `i` is even, and starting with '4' if `i` is odd, `tem2` is a list of the same length where each element alternates between '7' and '4' starting with '7' if `i` is even, and starting with '4' if `i` is odd, `four` and `four2` are both \(a3 + a4\), and `seven` and `seven2` are both \(a3 + a4\). Additionally, the condition \((four > a[0] \text{ or } seven > a[1]) \text{ and } (four2 > a[0] \text{ or } seven2 > a[1])\) holds true.***
