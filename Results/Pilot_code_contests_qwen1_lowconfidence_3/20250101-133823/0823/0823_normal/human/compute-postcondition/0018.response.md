Postcondition: ***`a3` and `a4` are integers such that \(1 \leq a3 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq a4 \leq 10^6\). `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the condition `(i & 1)` evaluates to true or false. `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`. `tem` and `tem2` are lists where each element is either '4' or '7'. `four`, `seven`, `four2`, and `seven2` are integers with specific values based on the evaluation of the condition `(i & 1)`. If `(i & 1)` is true, `four` and `four2` are incremented by 1, and `seven` and `seven2` remain the same. If `(i & 1)` is false, `seven` and `seven2` are incremented by 1, and `four` and `four2` remain the same.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts.
