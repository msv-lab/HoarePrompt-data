Postcondition: ***`a3` and `a4` are integers such that \(1 \leq a3 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq a4 \leq 10^6\), `i` is either 2 or 3, `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`, `tem` is a list containing either `['7', '4']` or `['7', '7']`, `tem2` is a list containing either `['7', '5', '7']` or `['7', '5', '4']`, `four2` is 6, `seven` is 2 more than its original unspecified value, and if `i` is 2, `seven2` is its original value + 1 or 2.***
