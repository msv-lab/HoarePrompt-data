The code `tem2.append('7')` appends the string `'7'` to the list `tem2`. Initially, `tem2` contains `['7']`. After appending `'7'`, `tem2` becomes `['7', '7']`.

All other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`a3` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a3 \leq 10^6\), `a4` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a4 \leq 10^6\), `i` is 1, `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`, `tem` is `['4', '4']`, `tem2` is `['7', '7']`, `four` is 1, `seven` is 0, `four2` is 0, `seven2` is 1**
