The code snippet `tem2.append('4')` appends the string `'4'` to the list `tem2`. Initially, `tem2` is `['7']`. After appending `'4'`, the list `tem2` becomes `['7', '4']`.

The other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a3` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a3 \leq 10^6\), `a4` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a4 \leq 10^6\), `i` is 0, `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`, `tem` is `['4', '7']`, `tem2` is `['7', '4']`, `four` is 1, `seven` is 0, `four2` is 0, `seven2` is 1, the condition `(i & 1)` is false**
