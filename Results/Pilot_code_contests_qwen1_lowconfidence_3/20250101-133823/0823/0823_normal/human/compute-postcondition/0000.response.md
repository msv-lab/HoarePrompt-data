The code reads four integers from standard input, splits them, and converts each one to an integer before storing them in a list `a`. The variables `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, and `a4` are no longer individual integers but are now part of a list `a`.

Output State: **`a1`, `a2`, `a3`, and `a4` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` â‰¤ 10^6; `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`**
