The code prints a formatted string using the values of the existing variables. Here's the breakdown:

1. `%s%s%s%s` is a format string that takes four arguments.
2. `tem[0]` is the first character of `tem`.
3. `ext4` is a string of `'4'` characters repeated `a[0] - four` times.
4. `tem[1:]` is a slice of `tem` starting from the second character to the end.
5. `ext7` is a string of `'7'` characters repeated `a[1] - seven` times.

Since no variables are assigned new values within the code, only the print statement is executed, which does not affect the variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a3` is the same; `a4` is the same; `i` is the same; `a` is the same; `tem` is the same; `tem2` is the same; `four` is the same; `four2` is the same; `seven` is the same; `seven2` is the same; `ext4` is a string of `'4'` characters repeated `a[0] - four` times; `ext7` is a string of `'7'` characters repeated `a[1] - seven` times; the condition \((four \leq a[0] \land seven \leq a[1]) \lor (four2 \leq a[0] \land seven2 \leq a[1])\) still holds; the last character of `tem` is `'7'`; a string is printed with the format `%s%s%s%s` containing the first character of `tem`, followed by `ext4`, then the rest of `tem`, and finally `ext7`.**
