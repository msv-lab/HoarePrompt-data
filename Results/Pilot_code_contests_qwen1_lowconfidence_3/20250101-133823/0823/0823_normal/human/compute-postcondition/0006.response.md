The code assigns the value `0` to `four2` and the value `1` to `seven2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` ≤ 10^6; `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`; the absolute difference between `a3` and `a4` is less than or equal to 1; `tem` is `['4']`; `tem2` is `['7']`; `four` is 1; `seven` is 0; `four2` is 0; `seven2` is 1.

Output State: **`a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` ≤ 10^6; `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`; the absolute difference between `a3` and `a4` is less than or equal to 1; `tem` is `['4']`; `tem2` is `['7']`; `four` is 1; `seven` is 0; `four2` is 0; `seven2` is 1.**
