The code `print(-1)` does not affect the values of the variables `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4`, or `a`. It simply prints `-1` to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that `-1` is printed.

Output State: **`a1`, `a2`, `a3`, and `a4` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` ≤ 10^6; `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`. The absolute difference between the third and fourth elements of `a` is greater than 1; -1 is printed.**
