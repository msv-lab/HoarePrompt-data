Postcondition: ***`a3` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a3 \leq 10^6\), `a4` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a4 \leq 10^6\), `i` is 1, `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`, `tem` is `['4']`, `tem2` is `['7']`, `four` is 1, `seven` is 0, `four2` is 0, `seven2` is 1***

Explanation: Since the if condition `(i & 1)` evaluates to true when `i` is odd (in this case, `i` starts as 0 and will become 1 after entering the if block), the postcondition reflects the change in `i` to 1 while retaining all other variables' states from the precondition.
