The variable `four` is incremented by 1. Initially, `four` is 1, so after the increment, `four` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a3` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a3 \leq 10^6\), `a4` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a4 \leq 10^6\), `i` is 1, `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`, `tem` is `['4', '4']`, `tem2` is `['7', '7']`, `four` is 2, `seven` is 0, `four2` is 0, `seven2` is 1**
