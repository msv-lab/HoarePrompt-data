The code appends the string `'7'` to the list `tem2`. The initial state shows that `tem2` is a list containing `['4']`. After appending `'7'`, `tem2` will contain both `'4'` and `'7'`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a3` and `a4` are integers such that \(1 \leq a3 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq a4 \leq 10^6\), `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`, `tem` is a list containing `['4']`, `tem2` is a list containing `['4', '7']`, `four`, `seven`, `four2`, and `seven2` are unchanged.**
