The code appends the string `'7'` to the list `tem`. The value of `i` is 1, but the code does not affect `i` or any other variables. The other lists and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a3` and `a4` are integers such that \(1 \leq a3 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq a4 \leq 10^6\), `i` is 1, `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`, `tem` is a list containing `'7'`, `tem2` is a list where each element is either '4' or '7', `four`, `seven`, `four2`, and `seven2` are updated based on the new value of `i`, and `tem` has been updated to include `'7'`.**
