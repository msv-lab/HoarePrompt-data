Postcondition: ***`a1`, `a2`, `a3`, and `a4` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` ≤ 10^6; `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`. If the absolute difference between the third and fourth elements of `a` is greater than 1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed if \((four > a[0] \text{ or } seven > a[1]) \text{ and } (four2 > a[0] \text{ or } seven2 > a[1])\). Otherwise, either the string is printed with the format `%s%s%s%s` containing the first character of `tem`, followed by `ext4`, then the rest of `tem`, and finally `ext7`, or `tem` is updated to `tem[0] + '4' * (a[0] - four) + tem[1:len(tem)-1] + '7' * (a[1] - seven) + tem[-1]`, and the condition \((four \leq a[0] \land seven \leq a[1]) \lor (four2 \leq a[0] \land seven2 \leq a[1])\) still holds.***
