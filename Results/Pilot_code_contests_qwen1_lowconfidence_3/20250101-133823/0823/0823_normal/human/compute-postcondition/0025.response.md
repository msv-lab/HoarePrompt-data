`tem2` appends the value `'4'` to itself. Since `tem2` was initially a list containing `'7'`, after appending `'4'`, `tem2` becomes `['7', '4']`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a3` and `a4` are integers such that \(1 \leq a3 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq a4 \leq 10^6\), `i` is 1, `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`, `tem` is a list containing `'7'`, `tem2` is a list containing `['7', '4']`, `four`, `seven`, `four2`, and `seven2` are updated based on the new value of `i`, and `tem` has been updated to include `'7'`.**
