Postcondition: **`a3` is the same; `a4` is the same; `i` is the same; `a` is the same; `tem` is the same; `tem2` is the same; `four` is the same; `four2` is the same; `seven` is the same; `seven2` is the same; `ext4` is a string of `'4'` characters repeated `a[0] - four` times; `ext7` is a string of `'7'` characters repeated `a[1] - seven` times; the condition \((four \leq a[0] \land seven \leq a[1]) \lor (four2 \leq a[0] \land seven2 \leq a[1])\) still holds; `tem[-1]` is not equal to `'7'`**
