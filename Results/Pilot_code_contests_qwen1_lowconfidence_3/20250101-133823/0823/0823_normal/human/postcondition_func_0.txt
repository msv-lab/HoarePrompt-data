The function reads four integers \(a1, a2, a3,\) and \(a4\) from standard input, where \(1 \leq a1, a2, a3, a4 \leq 10^6\). It then constructs two lists, `tem` and `tem2`, which contain alternating characters '4' and '7'. Depending on the parity of the index, `tem` starts with '7' and `tem2` starts with '4'. After constructing these lists, it checks if the counts of '4' and '7' in `tem` and `tem2` exceed certain thresholds defined by `a1` and `a2`. If both counts exceed the thresholds, it prints -1. If the counts do not exceed the thresholds and the absolute difference between `a3` and `a4` is not greater than 1, it formats and prints a string based on the last character of `tem`. This string includes a prefix, a suffix, and the remaining characters of `tem`, adjusted by the required number of '4's and '7's to meet the thresholds. If the absolute difference between `a3` and `a4` is greater than 1, it immediately prints -1. The function does not return any value.
