Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `a2` (the count of '7') is less than `a3` (the count of '47'), which implies there must be more '7's before '4's to form '74'. Specifically, consider the input `a1=3, a2=2, a3=1, a4=1`. According to the problem description, we need exactly one occurrence of '47', so there should be one '7' followed by one '4'. However, the current implementation does not ensure this condition is met, leading to an incorrect output. 

For instance, running the program with input `3 2 1 1` should produce `747`, but the current implementation may generate an invalid string due to the way it appends characters.
