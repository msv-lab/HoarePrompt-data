Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Handling the Parity Difference Between `a3` and `a4`:**
   - The program checks `if (abs(a[2] - a[3]) > 1)` to determine if the output should be `-1`. However, the problem description specifies that the difference between `a3` and `a4` should not exceed 1. The correct check should be `if (abs(a[2] - a[3]) > 1)` but the logic inside the conditional statements is flawed.

2. **Construction of Lucky Number Strings:**
   - The program constructs two lists `tem` and `tem2` with alternating '4' and '7'. It then checks the counts of '4' and '7' in these lists to ensure they meet the conditions specified by `a1` and `a2`.
   - The program correctly handles the cases where the counts exceed the thresholds by printing `-1`. However, it does not handle the case where the counts do not exceed the thresholds and the difference between `a3` and `a4` is exactly 1, which is allowed.

3. **Constructing the Final Lucky Number:**
   - The final construction of the lucky number string is done based on the last character of `tem`. This logic is partially correct but incomplete. The program should also consider the relative values of `a3` and `a4` to ensure the correct placement of '47' and '74' substrings.

### Correct Approach:
- The program needs to ensure that the constructed lucky number string meets all the given conditions:
  - `cnt(4) = a1`
  - `cnt(7) = a2`
  - `cnt(47) = a3`
  - `cnt(74) = a4`
- The program should handle the cases where the counts do not exceed the thresholds and the difference between `a3` and `a4` is at most 1.
- The construction of the final lucky number should place '47' and '74' substrings correctly to meet the required counts.

### Example:
For input `2 2 1 1`, the expected output is `4774` because:
- `cnt(4) = 2`
- `cnt(7) = 2`
- `cnt(47) = 1`
- `cnt(74) = 1`

The current implementation does not handle such cases correctly and sometimes prints `-1` even when a valid solution exists.

Therefore, the program is not correct as it does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
