You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya loves lucky numbers very much. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal record contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

Petya loves long lucky numbers very much. He is interested in the minimum lucky number d that meets some condition. Let cnt(x) be the number of occurrences of number x in number d as a substring. For example, if d = 747747, then cnt(4) = 2, cnt(7) = 4, cnt(47) = 2, cnt(74) = 2. Petya wants the following condition to fulfil simultaneously: cnt(4) = a1, cnt(7) = a2, cnt(47) = a3, cnt(74) = a4. Petya is not interested in the occurrences of other numbers. Help him cope with this task.

Input

The single line contains four integers a1, a2, a3 and a4 (1 ≤ a1, a2, a3, a4 ≤ 106).

Output

On the single line print without leading zeroes the answer to the problem — the minimum lucky number d such, that cnt(4) = a1, cnt(7) = a2, cnt(47) = a3, cnt(74) = a4. If such number does not exist, print the single number "-1" (without the quotes).

        (four, seven) = (1, 0)
        (four2, seven2) = (0, 1)

                four2 += 1
                seven += 1
        if (four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) and (four2 > a[0] or seven2 > a[1]):
            print(-1)
        else:
            if (four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) or a[2] < a[3]:
                (tem, four, seven) = (tem2, four2, seven2)
            (ext4, ext7) = ('4' * (a[0] - four), '7' * (a[1] - seven))
            if tem[-1] == '7':
                print('%s%s%s%s' % (tem[0], ext4, ''.join(tem[1:]), ext7))
            else:
                print('%s%s%s%s%s' % (tem[0], ext4, ''.join(tem[1:-1]), ext7, tem[-1]))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a flaw in handling cases where the required counts of substrings `47` and `74` are not compatible with each other. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case where the absolute difference between `a3` (count of `47`) and `a4` (count of `74`) is greater than 1. 

For example, consider the input `4 7 3 1`. According to the problem description, we need a lucky number where the count of `47` is 3 and the count of `74` is 1. However, the program incorrectly outputs `-1` in this case, which is wrong because a valid lucky number exists: `7474747`.

To fix this, the program needs to check the compatibility of `a3` and `a4` more thoroughly and construct the number accordingly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads four integers \(a1, a2, a3,\) and \(a4\) from standard input, where \(1 \leq a1, a2, a3, a4 \leq 10^6\). It then constructs two lists, `tem` and `tem2`, which contain alternating characters '4' and '7'. Depending on the parity of the index, `tem` starts with '7' and `tem2` starts with '4'. After constructing these lists, it checks if the counts of '4' and '7' in `tem` and `tem2` exceed certain thresholds defined by `a1` and `a2`. If both counts exceed the thresholds, it prints -1. If the counts do not exceed the thresholds and the absolute difference between `a3` and `a4` is not greater than 1, it formats and prints a string based on the last character of `tem`. This string includes a prefix, a suffix, and the remaining characters of `tem`, adjusted by the required number of '4's and '7's to meet the thresholds. If the absolute difference between `a3` and `a4` is greater than 1, it immediately prints -1. The function does not return any value.
