Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a flaw in handling cases where the required counts of substrings `47` and `74` are not compatible with each other. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case where the absolute difference between `a3` (count of `47`) and `a4` (count of `74`) is greater than 1. 

For example, consider the input `4 7 3 1`. According to the problem description, we need a lucky number where the count of `47` is 3 and the count of `74` is 1. However, the program incorrectly outputs `-1` in this case, which is wrong because a valid lucky number exists: `7474747`.

To fix this, the program needs to check the compatibility of `a3` and `a4` more thoroughly and construct the number accordingly.
