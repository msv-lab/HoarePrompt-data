Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the code fails to construct a valid lucky number in cases where the constraints on the counts of substrings (cnt(4), cnt(7), cnt(47), cnt(74)) cannot be satisfied. Here are some specific issues:

1. **Edge Cases with Uneven Counts**: The code checks if `abs(a[2] - a[3]) > 1` and prints `-1` if this condition is met. However, the code does not properly handle cases where `a3` and `a4` are not balanced even when `abs(a[2] - a[3]) <= 1`. For example, if `a1 = 2`, `a2 = 2`, `a3 = 2`, and `a4 = 1`, the code will not produce a valid lucky number because it cannot satisfy both `cnt(47) = 2` and `cnt(74) = 1`.

2. **Construction Logic**: The construction logic in the loops does not ensure that the resulting number is the minimum lucky number. For instance, if `a1 = 2`, `a2 = 2`, `a3 = 1`, and `a4 = 1`, the code will produce `4747`, but the correct answer should be `474`. The current implementation does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest solution.

Here is a counterexample:
- Input: `2 2 1 1`
- Expected Output: `474` (the smallest number with `cnt(4) = 2`, `cnt(7) = 2`, `cnt(47) = 1`, `cnt(74) = 1`)
- Actual Output: `4774` (which is not the smallest possible number)

Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and thus the correctness is **False**.
