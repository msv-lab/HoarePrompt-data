Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum lucky number \(d\) such that \(cnt(4) = a1\), \(cnt(7) = a2\), \(cnt(47) = a3\), and \(cnt(74) = a4\). Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Parity Check:**
   - The condition `(abs(a[2] - a[3]) > 1)` checks if the counts of substrings "47" and "74" differ by more than 1. However, this check alone is insufficient to ensure that the final solution is valid. It needs to be combined with other conditions to ensure all constraints are met.

2. **Incorrect Construction of the Result String:**
   - The program constructs two alternating strings `tem` and `tem2` but does not correctly adjust these strings based on the actual values of `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, and `a4`.
   - The program does not ensure that the final string satisfies all the required counts of substrings "4", "7", "47", and "74".

3. **Handling of Constraints:**
   - The program does not properly handle the constraints \(cnt(4) = a1\), \(cnt(7) = a2\), \(cnt(47) = a3\), and \(cnt(74) = a4\). Specifically, it does not correctly distribute the characters to meet these constraints while ensuring the minimum possible length.

To illustrate with examples:
- For the input `2 2 1 1`, the expected output is `4774` because there are 2 occurrences of '4', 2 occurrences of '7', 1 occurrence of "47", and 1 occurrence of "74". However, the current program may fail to produce this output due to its flawed logic.
- For the input `4 7 3 1`, the expected output is `-1` because it is impossible to construct a number that meets the exact counts of "4", "7", "47", and "74" simultaneously under the given constraints.

In conclusion, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described, and thus, it is incorrect.
