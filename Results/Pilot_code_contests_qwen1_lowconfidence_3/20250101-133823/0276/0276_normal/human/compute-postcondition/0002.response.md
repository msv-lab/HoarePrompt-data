The code initializes an empty string to `encoding_str`. This does not affect the values of `encoding_toks`, `word_list`, or `message_str`. 

Output State: **`encoding_toks` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `encoding` at each occurrence of `<3`; `word_list` is a list of strings representing the words that Dima intended to send; `message_str` is a string obtained by joining all elements in `word_list`; `encoding_str` is an empty string**.
