To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the information provided and the loop itself.

### Given Information:
- `encoding_toks` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `encoding` at each occurrence of `<3`.
- `word_list` is a list of strings representing the words that Dima intended to send.
- `message_str` is a string obtained by joining all elements in `word_list`.
- `encoding_str` is an empty string.

### Loop Analysis:
```
for enc in encoding_toks[1:-1]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **List `encoding_toks`:**
   - The loop iterates over `encoding_toks[1:-1]`, meaning it skips the first and the last element of `encoding_toks`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `encoding_toks` must have more than two elements (at least 3 elements), because it is iterating from the second element to the second-to-last element.
   - The loop variable `enc` will take on the value of each element in `encoding_toks[1:-1]`.

### Required Adjustments:
- Ensure that `encoding_toks` has at least 3 elements. This is because the loop iterates from the second to the second-to-last element.
- Since the loop body is omitted, no specific state changes within the loop are needed, but we need to ensure that the list has the required elements for the loop to proceed.

### Final State:
- `encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements.
- `word_list`, `message_str`, and `encoding_str` do not directly affect the loop's execution since they are not used within the loop.

Therefore, the final state to adjust for the loop to execute is:
State: **`encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements**
