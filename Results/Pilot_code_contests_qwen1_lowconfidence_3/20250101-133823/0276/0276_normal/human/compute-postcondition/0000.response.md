The code `encoding_toks = encoding.split('<3')` splits the `encoding` string using the sequence `<3` as the delimiter. This operation does not affect the `word_list` variable. After executing this line, `encoding_toks` will contain a list of substrings obtained by splitting `encoding` at each occurrence of `<3`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`encoding_toks` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `encoding` at each occurrence of `<3`; `word_list` is a list of strings representing the words that Dima intended to send.**
