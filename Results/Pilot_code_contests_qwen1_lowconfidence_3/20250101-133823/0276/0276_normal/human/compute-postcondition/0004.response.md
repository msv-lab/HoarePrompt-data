The code `enc = func_1(enc)` updates the value of `enc` to the result of calling the function `func_1` with `enc` as the argument. However, the specific behavior of `func_1` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `enc`. We only know that `enc` is now the output of `func_1(enc)`. The precondition that `encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements remains valid.

Output State: **`encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements, `enc` is the result of `func_1(enc)`**
