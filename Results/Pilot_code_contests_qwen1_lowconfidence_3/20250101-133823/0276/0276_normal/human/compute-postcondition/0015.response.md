`enc` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(enc)`. The original value of `enc` is the third element in the list `encoding_toks`. Since the function `func_1` is applied to `enc`, the exact value of `enc` after the function call cannot be determined without knowing the specifics of `func_1`. However, we know that `encoding_str` is updated to include `enc` at the end of its original value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoding_toks` must have at least 6 elements, `encoding_str` is the concatenation of its original value and the value of the third element in `encoding_toks`, `enc` is the value returned by `func_1(enc)`**
