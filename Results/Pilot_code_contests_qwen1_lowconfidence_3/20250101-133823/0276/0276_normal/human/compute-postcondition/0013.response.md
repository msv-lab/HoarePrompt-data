The code `encoding_str += enc` appends the value of `enc` to `encoding_str`. Given the initial state:

- `encoding_toks` must have at least 4 elements.
- `encoding_str` includes the new value of `enc`. If `enc` is empty, the function returns 'no'. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.

Since the code is executed, `enc` is not empty, so the function does not return anything and proceeds to append `enc` to `encoding_str`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `encoding_toks` must have at least 4 elements.
- `encoding_str` is now the concatenation of its original value and `enc`.

Output State: **`encoding_toks` must have at least 4 elements, `encoding_str` is the concatenation of its original value and `enc`**
