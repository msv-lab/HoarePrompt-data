According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `encoding_toks`. The loop iterates over `encoding_toks[1:-1]`, meaning it skips the first and last elements of `encoding_toks`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements.
- `enc` is the result of `func_1(enc)`, and `enc` is not empty.
- `encoding_str` is updated to include the value of `enc`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `encoding_toks` must have at least 4 elements because the loop iterates over `encoding_toks[1:-1]`, and skipping the first and last element means there must be an additional element beyond the current ones to continue the loop.
2. `enc` will be set to the next element in `encoding_toks[1:-1]`.
3. `enc` must be a non-empty result from `func_1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `encoding_toks` must have at least 4 elements.
- `enc` will be the next element in `encoding_toks[1:-1]`.
- `encoding_str` will be updated to include the new value of `enc`.

State: **`encoding_toks` must have at least 4 elements, `enc` will be the next element in `encoding_toks[1:-1]`, and `enc` is not empty; `encoding_str` is updated to include the value of `enc`**
