The code snippet `encoding_str += enc` impacts the variable `encoding_str` by appending the value of `enc` to itself. Since the initial state specifies that `enc` is the value returned by `func_1(enc)` and if `enc` is false, the function returns 'no', we need to consider both cases:

1. If `enc` is false, then `encoding_str` will be updated to `encoding_str + 'no'`.
2. If `enc` is true, then `encoding_str` will be updated to `encoding_str + enc`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `encoding_toks` must have at least 6 elements.
- `encoding_str` is the concatenation of its original value and the value of the third element in `encoding_toks`.
- `enc` is the value returned by `func_1(enc)`.

Since the value of `enc` is not explicitly defined in the code snippet, we consider both scenarios. However, the output state will reflect the change in `encoding_str`.

Output State: **`encoding_toks` must have at least 6 elements, `encoding_str` is the concatenation of its original value and the value of the third element in `encoding_toks`, and `encoding_str` is updated to `encoding_str + 'no'` if `enc` is false, or `encoding_str + enc` if `enc` is true.**
