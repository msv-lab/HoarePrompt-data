Postcondition: ***`encoding_toks` must have at least 6 elements, `encoding_str` is the concatenation of its original value and the value of the third element in `encoding_toks`, and `enc` is the value returned by `func_1(enc)`. If `enc` is false, the function returns 'no'. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (the else part has no explicit return statement).***
