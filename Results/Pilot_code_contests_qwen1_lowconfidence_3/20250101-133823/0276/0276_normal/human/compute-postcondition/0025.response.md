Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `encoding` and `word_list`. `encoding` is a string containing the encoded message with hearts (sequences of "<3") separating words, and `word_list` is a list of strings representing the words that Dima intended to send. The function processes the `encoding` string by splitting it into parts using the heart separator and applying the `func_1` function to each part. If any part processed by `func_1` results in an empty string, the function immediately returns 'no'. Otherwise, it reconstructs the message by concatenating the results of `func_1` calls and compares it with the original message represented by `word_list`. If the reconstructed message matches the original message, the function returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function checks if `func_1(enc)` returns an empty string for each part of the `encoding` string. If any such part results in an empty string, the function returns 'no' without further processing. This handles the case where at least one part of the encoded message is invalid.
- There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code for handling situations where `encoding` or `word_list` might be empty. However, the function should handle these cases appropriately:
  - If `encoding` is an empty string, the function should return 'no' since there are no parts to process.
  - If `word_list` is an empty list, the function should return 'no' since there are no intended words to match against the encoded message.
  
- The function assumes that `func_1` is defined elsewhere and correctly handles the transformation of each part of the `encoding` string. If `func_1` were to fail or behave unexpectedly, the function's behavior could be incorrect. Therefore, it is important that `func_1` functions as expected to ensure the overall correctness of `func_2`.
