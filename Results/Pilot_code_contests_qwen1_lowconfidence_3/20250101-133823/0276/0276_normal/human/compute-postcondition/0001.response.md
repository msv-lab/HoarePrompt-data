The code `message_str = ''.join(word_list)` joins all the elements in the `word_list` into a single string using no separator (hence the empty string `'`). This operation does not affect the `encoding_toks` list, which remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `encoding_toks` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `encoding` at each occurrence of `<3`; `word_list` is a list of strings representing the words that Dima intended to send; `message_str` is a string obtained by joining all elements in `word_list`.
