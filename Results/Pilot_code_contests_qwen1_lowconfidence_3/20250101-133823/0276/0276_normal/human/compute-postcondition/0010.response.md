`enc` is reassigned the value returned by `func_1(enc)`. The original value of `enc` is not specified, but it is known that `encoding_toks` has at least 4 elements, `enc` is the next element in `encoding_toks[1:-1]`, and `enc` is not empty. The state of `encoding_str` is updated to include the new value of `enc`. 

Output State: **`encoding_toks` must have at least 4 elements, `enc` is the next element in `encoding_toks[1:-1]` and now equals `func_1(original enc)`, and `encoding_str` includes the new value of `enc`**
