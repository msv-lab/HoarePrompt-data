`encoding_str` is assigned the value of `encoding_str + enc`. The value of `enc` is the result of `func_1(enc)`, which means `enc` is not empty. Since `encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements, this condition remains unchanged. The output state is: `encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements, `enc` is the result of `func_1(enc)`, and `enc` is not empty; `encoding_str` is updated to include the value of `enc`.

Output State: **`encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements, `enc` is the result of `func_1(enc)`, and `enc` is not empty; `encoding_str` is updated to include the value of `enc`**
