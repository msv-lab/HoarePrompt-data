Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the insertion of random characters (small English letters, digits, signs "more" and "less") into the encoded message. The `func_2` function only checks if the core parts of the encoded message match the original message without considering the random characters inserted by Dima.

For example, consider the following input:
- Words: `["i", "am", "not", "main", "in", "the", "family"]`
- Encoded message: `<3i<3am<23not<3<main<3in<3the<3&gt;<3family<3`

The program would fail to identify this as a valid encoded message because it does not account for the random characters (`2`, `>`).

To fix this, the program needs to check if the random characters can be removed and still match the original message. This requires more complex logic to handle the random insertions correctly.
