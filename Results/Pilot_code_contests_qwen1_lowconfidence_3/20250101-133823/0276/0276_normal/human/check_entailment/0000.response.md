Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the words in the message contain special characters such as "less" (<) and "greater" (>) signs. Specifically, the `func_1` function removes all non-alphabetic characters, which means it will remove these special characters. However, according to the problem description, these special characters should be preserved in the encoded message.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
i
am
not
&lt;3i&lt;&gt;3am&lt;3the&lt;3&lt;main&lt;3in&lt;3the&lt;3&gt;&lt;3family&lt;3
```

The correct encoded message should maintain the special characters, but the current implementation would remove them. Therefore, the program does not correctly decode the message in this case.
