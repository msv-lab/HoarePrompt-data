Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the insertion of random characters into the encoded message. Specifically, the function `func_2` only checks if the core parts of the encoded message match the original message without considering the random characters inserted by Dima. According to the annotations, the program does not account for the random insertions correctly, which means it cannot verify if a text message was encoded in the specified manner. Therefore, the program fails to meet the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
