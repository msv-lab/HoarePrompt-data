You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Seryozha has a very changeable character. This time he refused to leave the room to Dima and his girlfriend (her hame is Inna, by the way). However, the two lovebirds can always find a way to communicate. Today they are writing text messages to each other.

Dima and Inna are using a secret code in their text messages. When Dima wants to send Inna some sentence, he writes out all words, inserting a heart before each word and after the last word. A heart is a sequence of two characters: the "less" characters (<) and the digit three (3). After applying the code, a test message looks like that: <3word1<3word2<3 ... wordn<3.

Encoding doesn't end here. Then Dima inserts a random number of small English characters, digits, signs "more" and "less" into any places of the message.

Inna knows Dima perfectly well, so she knows what phrase Dima is going to send her beforehand. Inna has just got a text message. Help her find out if Dima encoded the message correctly. In other words, find out if a text message could have been received by encoding in the manner that is described above.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of words in Dima's message. Next n lines contain non-empty words, one word per line. The words only consist of small English letters. The total length of all words doesn't exceed 105. 

The last line contains non-empty text message that Inna has got. The number of characters in the text message doesn't exceed 105. A text message can contain only small English letters, digits and signs more and less.

Output

In a single line, print "yes" (without the quotes), if Dima decoded the text message correctly, and "no" (without the quotes) otherwise.

Examples

Input

3
i
love
you
&lt;3i&lt;3love&lt;23you&lt;3


Output

yes


Input

7
i
am
not
main
in
the
family
&lt;3i&lt;&gt;3am&lt;3the&lt;3&lt;main&lt;3in&lt;3the&lt;3&gt;&lt;3family&lt;3


Output

no

Note

Please note that Dima got a good old kick in the pants for the second sample from the statement.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(string):
    return ''.join(filter(lambda x: x.isalpha(), string))

#Function 2:
def func_2(encoding, word_list):
    encoding_toks = encoding.split('<3')
    message_str = ''.join(word_list)
    encoding_str = ''
    for enc in encoding_toks[1:-1]:
        enc = func_1(enc)
        if not enc:
            return 'no'
        encoding_str += enc
    if encoding_str == message_str:
        return 'yes'
    else:
        return 'no'


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the insertion of random characters (small English letters, digits, signs "more" and "less") into the encoded message. The `func_2` function only checks if the core parts of the encoded message match the original message without considering the random characters inserted by Dima.

For example, consider the following input:
- Words: `["i", "am", "not", "main", "in", "the", "family"]`
- Encoded message: `<3i<3am<23not<3<main<3in<3the<3&gt;<3family<3`

The program would fail to identify this as a valid encoded message because it does not account for the random characters (`2`, `>`).

To fix this, the program needs to check if the random characters can be removed and still match the original message. This requires more complex logic to handle the random insertions correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(raw_input())
    word_list = []
    for i in range(n):
        word_list.append(raw_input())
    encoding = raw_input()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters, digits, and the "<" and ">" characters. The string represents a potentially encoded message.
def func_1(string):
    return ''.join(filter(lambda x: x.isalpha(), string))
    #The program returns a string containing only the alphabetical characters from the original string, with all other characters (digits, "<", ">") removed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `string`, which can contain small English letters, digits, and the "<" and ">" characters. It processes the string by filtering out all non-alphabetical characters (digits and "<" and ">") and returns a new string containing only the alphabetical characters from the original string. The function effectively removes all digits and special characters from the input string, leaving only the alphabetic characters. This process ensures that the returned string consists solely of letters from the English alphabet.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoding is a string containing the encoded message with hearts (sequences of "<3") separating words, and word_list is a list of strings representing the words that Dima intended to send. Each word in word_list is a valid word from the input and is separated by "<3".
def func_2(encoding, word_list):
    encoding_toks = encoding.split('<3')
    message_str = ''.join(word_list)
    encoding_str = ''
    for enc in encoding_toks[1:-1]:
        enc = func_1(enc)
        
        if not enc:
            return 'no'
        
        encoding_str += enc
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: - After all iterations of the loop, `encoding_str` will contain the concatenation of all valid `enc` values obtained from `func_1(enc)` for each iteration where `enc` is not empty.
    #   - If any `enc` is such that `func_1(enc)` returns an empty string, `encoding_str` will be updated to `encoding_str + 'no'`.
    #
    #### Summary:
    #-
    if (encoding_str == message_str) :
        return 'yes'
        #The program returns 'yes'
    else :
        return 'no'
        #The program returns 'no'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `encoding` and `word_list`. `encoding` is a string containing the encoded message with hearts (sequences of "<3") separating words, and `word_list` is a list of strings representing the words that Dima intended to send. The function processes the `encoding` string by splitting it into parts using the heart separator and applying the `func_1` function to each part. If any part processed by `func_1` results in an empty string, the function immediately returns 'no'. Otherwise, it reconstructs the message by concatenating the results of `func_1` calls and compares it with the original message represented by `word_list`. If the reconstructed message matches the original message, the function returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
