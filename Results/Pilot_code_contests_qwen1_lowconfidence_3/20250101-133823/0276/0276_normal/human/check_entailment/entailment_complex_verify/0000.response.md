Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated version clarifies that the `func_1` function removes all non-alphabetic characters from the input string, which contradicts the problem description that requires preserving special characters such as "<" and ">". The original assessment correctly identified that the program does not handle the preservation of these special characters, which is essential for correctly decoding the message. Therefore, the program cannot be considered correct under the given problem description.
