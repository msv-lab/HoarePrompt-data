Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the provided annotations and the original problem description, the program does not correctly handle the insertion of random characters into the encoded message. The function `func_2` only checks if the core parts of the encoded message (after removing hearts and applying `func_1`) match the original message. However, it does not verify if the random characters inserted by Dima can be removed to still match the original message. This means that the program will incorrectly identify messages as valid if the random characters do not allow the core parts to match the original words.

The original assessment is accurate because the program fails to account for the possibility of random characters being inserted into the encoded message, which is a crucial part of the problem description. The annotated version confirms this issue by showing that `func_2` does not handle the random characters correctly. Therefore, the program cannot be considered fully correct according to the given requirements.
