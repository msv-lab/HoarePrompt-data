Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the `func_1` function removes all non-alphabetic characters, including special characters like "<" and ">". According to the problem description, these special characters must be preserved in the encoded message. However, the program removes them, leading to potential mismatches between the encoded message and the original message sent by Dima. Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the encoding and decoding process as specified, and thus cannot accurately determine if the encoded message is valid.
