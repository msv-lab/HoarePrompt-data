Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the encoded message has an extra heart (`<3`) at the end. According to the problem description, Dima inserts a heart after the last word and before each word. Therefore, the encoded message should have exactly one heart at the end and hearts before each word. However, the provided code checks only the hearts between words and does not verify the heart at the end of the encoded message. This means that if the encoded message has an extra heart at the end, the function will still return 'yes', which is incorrect. For example, if the encoded message is `<3i<3love<3you<3` instead of `<3i<3love<3you<3`, the function will return 'yes' even though the heart at the end is unnecessary.
