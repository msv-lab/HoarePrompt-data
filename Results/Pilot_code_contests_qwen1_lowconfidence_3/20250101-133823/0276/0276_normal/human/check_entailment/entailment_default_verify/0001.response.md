Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not handle the random characters inserted by Dima into the encoded message. The `func_2` function only checks if the parts of the encoded message (after removing hearts) match the original words without considering the random characters. The output hints confirm this limitation, indicating that the function only checks the core parts of the encoded message and does not account for the random insertions. Therefore, the program fails to correctly validate the encoded message according to the problem description.
