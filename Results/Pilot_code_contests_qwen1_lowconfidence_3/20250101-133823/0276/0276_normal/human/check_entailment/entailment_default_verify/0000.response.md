Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly handle the preservation of special characters such as "<" and ">" in the encoded message. The function `func_1` removes all non-alphabetic characters, which means it will remove these special characters, leading to incorrect decoding. According to the problem description and the output hints, these special characters should be preserved. The provided code does not account for this requirement, as demonstrated in the example inputs where the presence of "<" and ">" signs is crucial for correct decoding. Therefore, the program fails to meet the problem description and the output hints indicate that the current implementation is flawed.
