You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Seryozha has a very changeable character. This time he refused to leave the room to Dima and his girlfriend (her hame is Inna, by the way). However, the two lovebirds can always find a way to communicate. Today they are writing text messages to each other.

Dima and Inna are using a secret code in their text messages. When Dima wants to send Inna some sentence, he writes out all words, inserting a heart before each word and after the last word. A heart is a sequence of two characters: the "less" characters (<) and the digit three (3). After applying the code, a test message looks like that: <3word1<3word2<3 ... wordn<3.

Encoding doesn't end here. Then Dima inserts a random number of small English characters, digits, signs "more" and "less" into any places of the message.

Inna knows Dima perfectly well, so she knows what phrase Dima is going to send her beforehand. Inna has just got a text message. Help her find out if Dima encoded the message correctly. In other words, find out if a text message could have been received by encoding in the manner that is described above.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of words in Dima's message. Next n lines contain non-empty words, one word per line. The words only consist of small English letters. The total length of all words doesn't exceed 105. 

The last line contains non-empty text message that Inna has got. The number of characters in the text message doesn't exceed 105. A text message can contain only small English letters, digits and signs more and less.

Output

In a single line, print "yes" (without the quotes), if Dima decoded the text message correctly, and "no" (without the quotes) otherwise.

Examples

Input

3
i
love
you
&lt;3i&lt;3love&lt;23you&lt;3


Output

yes


Input

7
i
am
not
main
in
the
family
&lt;3i&lt;&gt;3am&lt;3the&lt;3&lt;main&lt;3in&lt;3the&lt;3&gt;&lt;3family&lt;3


Output

no

Note

Please note that Dima got a good old kick in the pants for the second sample from the statement.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(raw_input())
    word_list = []
    for i in range(n):
        word_list.append(raw_input())
    encoding = raw_input()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters, digits, and the "<" and ">" characters. The string represents a potentially encoded message.
def func_1(string):
    return ''.join(filter(lambda x: x.isalpha(), string))
    #The program returns a string containing only the alphabetical characters from the original string, with all other characters (digits, "<", ">") removed

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoding is a string containing the encoded message with hearts (sequences of "<3") separating words, and word_list is a list of strings representing the words that Dima intended to send. Each word in word_list is a valid word from the input and is separated by "<3".
def func_2(encoding, word_list):
    encoding_toks = encoding.split('<3')
    message_str = ''.join(word_list)
    encoding_str = ''
    for enc in encoding_toks[1:-1]:
        enc = func_1(enc)
        
        if not enc:
            return 'no'
        
        encoding_str += enc
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: - After all iterations of the loop, `encoding_str` will contain the concatenation of all valid `enc` values obtained from `func_1(enc)` for each iteration where `enc` is not empty.
    #   - If any `enc` is such that `func_1(enc)` returns an empty string, `encoding_str` will be updated to `encoding_str + 'no'`.
    #
    #### Summary:
    #-
    if (encoding_str == message_str) :
        return 'yes'
        #The program returns 'yes'
    else :
        return 'no'
        #The program returns 'no'


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
