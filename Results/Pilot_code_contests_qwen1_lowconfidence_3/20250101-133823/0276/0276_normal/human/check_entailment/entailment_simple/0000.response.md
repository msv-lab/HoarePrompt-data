Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of words `n`, followed by `n` words, and then the encoded message.
   - The number of words `n` and the words themselves are read correctly.
   - The encoded message is read as a single string.

2. **Function Definitions**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function filters out non-alphabetical characters from the input string.
     - It is used to clean up the encoded segments to check if they match the intended words.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function splits the encoded message at each occurrence of `<3` to separate the words.
     - It then removes any non-alphabetical characters from these segments using `func_1`.
     - If any segment results in an empty string after filtering, it immediately returns "no".
     - It concatenates the cleaned segments and checks if this matches the concatenated original words.
     - If the concatenated segments match the original words, it returns "yes"; otherwise, it returns "no".

3. **Logic Flow**:
   - The program processes the encoded message by removing all non-alphabetical characters.
   - It then compares the resulting string to the concatenated form of the intended words.
   - If the two strings match, it concludes that the encoding is correct; otherwise, it concludes that it is incorrect.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the encoded message might contain additional characters (like digits, `>`, `<`) which are ignored during comparison.
   - It ensures that even if there are extra characters in the encoded message, as long as the core structure matches, it considers it correct.

Given that the program follows the steps outlined in the problem description and correctly handles the necessary transformations and comparisons, the program is correct. Therefore, the output will be "True" as the program adheres to the requirements specified in the problem statement.
