Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly handle cases where Dima might insert a random number of small English characters, digits, signs "more" and "less" into any places of the message, as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not check for these arbitrary characters and their placement within the encoded message.

For example, consider the following input:
- Input words: `["i", "love", "you"]`
- Encoded message: `<3i<3love<23you<3abc123<>`

According to the problem description, the encoded message can contain any number of small English characters, digits, signs "more" and "less". However, the provided code only checks for the presence of words separated by "<3" and does not account for the additional characters ("abc123<>") that could be inserted by Dima.

The function `func_2` splits the encoded message by "<3" and then applies `func_1` to each segment, but it does not verify whether the remaining characters in the encoded message match the arbitrary insertions allowed by the problem description. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
