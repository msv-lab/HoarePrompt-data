Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where Dima inserts characters between the words in a way that disrupts the structure of the encoded message. Specifically, the code assumes that the only characters inserted between words are random, but it does not account for characters that might be inserted within the words themselves or in a way that invalidates the encoded structure.

For example, consider the following input:

Input:
```
3
i
love
you
&lt;3i&lt;3lo3ve&lt;3you&lt;3
```

Expected output:
```
no
```

However, the current implementation would incorrectly return:
```
yes
```

This is because the code only checks if the filtered message (after removing digits and special characters) matches the original message without considering the integrity of the encoded structure. Therefore, the program does not correctly validate the encoded message for all possible cases.
