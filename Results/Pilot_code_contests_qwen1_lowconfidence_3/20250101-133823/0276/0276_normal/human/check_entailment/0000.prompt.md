You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Seryozha has a very changeable character. This time he refused to leave the room to Dima and his girlfriend (her hame is Inna, by the way). However, the two lovebirds can always find a way to communicate. Today they are writing text messages to each other.

Dima and Inna are using a secret code in their text messages. When Dima wants to send Inna some sentence, he writes out all words, inserting a heart before each word and after the last word. A heart is a sequence of two characters: the "less" characters (<) and the digit three (3). After applying the code, a test message looks like that: <3word1<3word2<3 ... wordn<3.

Encoding doesn't end here. Then Dima inserts a random number of small English characters, digits, signs "more" and "less" into any places of the message.

Inna knows Dima perfectly well, so she knows what phrase Dima is going to send her beforehand. Inna has just got a text message. Help her find out if Dima encoded the message correctly. In other words, find out if a text message could have been received by encoding in the manner that is described above.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of words in Dima's message. Next n lines contain non-empty words, one word per line. The words only consist of small English letters. The total length of all words doesn't exceed 105. 

The last line contains non-empty text message that Inna has got. The number of characters in the text message doesn't exceed 105. A text message can contain only small English letters, digits and signs more and less.

Output

In a single line, print "yes" (without the quotes), if Dima decoded the text message correctly, and "no" (without the quotes) otherwise.

Examples

Input

3
i
love
you
&lt;3i&lt;3love&lt;23you&lt;3


Output

yes


Input

7
i
am
not
main
in
the
family
&lt;3i&lt;&gt;3am&lt;3the&lt;3&lt;main&lt;3in&lt;3the&lt;3&gt;&lt;3family&lt;3


Output

no

Note

Please note that Dima got a good old kick in the pants for the second sample from the statement.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(string):
    return ''.join(filter(lambda x: x.isalpha(), string))

#Function 2:
def func_2(encoding, word_list):
    encoding_toks = encoding.split('<3')
    message_str = ''.join(word_list)
    encoding_str = ''
    for enc in encoding_toks[1:-1]:
        enc = func_1(enc)
        if not enc:
            return 'no'
        encoding_str += enc
    if encoding_str == message_str:
        return 'yes'
    else:
        return 'no'


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
