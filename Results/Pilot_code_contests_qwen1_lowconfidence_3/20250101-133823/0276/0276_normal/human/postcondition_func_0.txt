The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `string`, which can contain small English letters, digits, and the "<" and ">" characters. It processes the string by filtering out all non-alphabetical characters (digits and "<" and ">") and returns a new string containing only the alphabetical characters from the original string. The function effectively removes all digits and special characters from the input string, leaving only the alphabetic characters. This process ensures that the returned string consists solely of letters from the English alphabet.
