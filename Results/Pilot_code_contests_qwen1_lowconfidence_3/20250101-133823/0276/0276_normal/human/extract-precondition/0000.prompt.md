You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Seryozha has a very changeable character. This time he refused to leave the room to Dima and his girlfriend (her hame is Inna, by the way). However, the two lovebirds can always find a way to communicate. Today they are writing text messages to each other.

Dima and Inna are using a secret code in their text messages. When Dima wants to send Inna some sentence, he writes out all words, inserting a heart before each word and after the last word. A heart is a sequence of two characters: the "less" characters (<) and the digit three (3). After applying the code, a test message looks like that: <3word1<3word2<3 ... wordn<3.

Encoding doesn't end here. Then Dima inserts a random number of small English characters, digits, signs "more" and "less" into any places of the message.

Inna knows Dima perfectly well, so she knows what phrase Dima is going to send her beforehand. Inna has just got a text message. Help her find out if Dima encoded the message correctly. In other words, find out if a text message could have been received by encoding in the manner that is described above.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of words in Dima's message. Next n lines contain non-empty words, one word per line. The words only consist of small English letters. The total length of all words doesn't exceed 105. 

The last line contains non-empty text message that Inna has got. The number of characters in the text message doesn't exceed 105. A text message can contain only small English letters, digits and signs more and less.

Output

In a single line, print "yes" (without the quotes), if Dima decoded the text message correctly, and "no" (without the quotes) otherwise.

Examples

Input

3
i
love
you
&lt;3i&lt;3love&lt;23you&lt;3


Output

yes


Input

7
i
am
not
main
in
the
family
&lt;3i&lt;&gt;3am&lt;3the&lt;3&lt;main&lt;3in&lt;3the&lt;3&gt;&lt;3family&lt;3


Output

no

Note

Please note that Dima got a good old kick in the pants for the second sample from the statement.
Program:
```
def func_2(encoding, word_list):
    encoding_toks = encoding.split('<3')
    message_str = ''.join(word_list)
    encoding_str = ''
    for enc in encoding_toks[1:-1]:
        enc = func_1(enc)
        if not enc:
            return 'no'
        encoding_str += enc
    if encoding_str == message_str:
        return 'yes'
    else:
        return 'no'
```
