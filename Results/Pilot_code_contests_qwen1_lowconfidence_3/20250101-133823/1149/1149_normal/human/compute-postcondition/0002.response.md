Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a list of integers `x` representing the weights of the luggage where 1 ≤ xi ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and xi ≠ xj for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n and i ≠ j. If the system's Python version is 2, built-in functions `range` and `input` are reassigned to `xrange` and `raw_input` respectively. No changes are made in other cases.***
