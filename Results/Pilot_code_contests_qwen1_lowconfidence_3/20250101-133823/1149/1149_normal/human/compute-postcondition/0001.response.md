The code snippet does not actually change any variable values or perform any operations. It simply reassigns the built-in functions `range` and `input` to `xrange` and `raw_input` respectively, which are specific to Python 2. These changes do not affect the values of the existing variables `n` or `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a list of integers `x` representing the weights of the luggage where 1 ≤ xi ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and xi ≠ xj for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n and i ≠ j. The current version of the system is Python 2. Built-in functions `range` and `input` are reassigned to `xrange` and `raw_input` respectively.**
