You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Taro has decided to move. Taro has a lot of luggage, so I decided to ask a moving company to carry the luggage. Since there are various weights of luggage, I asked them to arrange them in order from the lightest one for easy understanding, but the mover left the luggage in a different order. So Taro tried to sort the luggage, but the luggage is heavy and requires physical strength to carry. Each piece of luggage can be carried from where it is now to any place you like, such as between other pieces of luggage or at the edge of the piece of luggage, but carrying one piece of luggage uses as much physical strength as the weight of that piece of luggage. Taro doesn't have much physical strength, so I decided to think of a way to arrange the luggage in order from the lightest one without using as much physical strength as possible.

Constraints

> 1 ≤ n ≤ 105
> 1 ≤ xi ≤ n (1 ≤ i ≤ n)
> xi ≠ xj (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n and i ≠ j)
>

* All inputs are given as integers

Input

> n
> x1 x2 ... xn
>

* n represents the number of luggage that Taro has
* x1 to xn represent the weight of each piece of luggage, and are currently arranged in the order of x1, x2, ..., xn.

Output

> S
>

* Output the total S of the minimum physical strength required to arrange the luggage in order from the lightest, but output the line break at the end
