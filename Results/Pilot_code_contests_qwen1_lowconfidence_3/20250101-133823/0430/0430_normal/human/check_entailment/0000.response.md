Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly calculates the number of overlapping stickers on the origami paper. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Radius Check**: The program correctly uses a radius of \(1 + 1e-12\) to account for floating-point precision issues when checking if two circles overlap.
2. **Distance Calculation**: It accurately computes the Euclidean distance between the centers of two stickers using `math.hypot`.
3. **Overlap Condition**: The condition `distance <= RADIUS_2` ensures that only stickers within a distance of 2 units (considering the radius) are checked for overlap.
4. **Cross Points Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the cross points of the overlapping circles and checks if they lie within the boundaries of the origami paper (0.0 to 10.0).
5. **Counting Overlaps**: For each calculated cross point, the program counts how many stickers overlap at that point and keeps track of the maximum overlap.

Since the program follows the problem description accurately and handles all the potential cases mentioned, such as handling floating-point precision, checking for overlaps, and ensuring points lie within the origami boundaries, it is correct.
