n is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100. The subsequent n lines contain the coordinates (xi, yi) of the center of each sticker, where xi and yi are real numbers given with up to 6 digits after the decimal point. Each coordinate pair is separated by a comma. The center of each sticker is within the bounds of the origami paper (0 ≤ xi ≤ 10 and 0 ≤ yi ≤ 10).
