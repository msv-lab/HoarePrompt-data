The code snippet `cross_points.append(cp2)` appends the value of `cp2` to the list `cross_points`. Given the initial state, `cross_points` already contains `cp1` and possibly `cp1` again if certain conditions were met. The append operation will add `cp2` to this list.

The initial state includes:
- `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
- `num_data` is at least 1
- `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple
- `cross_points` is a list containing `cp1` and `cp2` (if the conditions were met)

After executing `cross_points.append(cp2)`, `cross_points` will now contain `cp1` and `cp2`.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is a list containing `cp1` and `cp2`**
