Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cross_points` is a non-empty list.
   - `max_overlap` is equal to the number of elements in `data` for which the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`.
   - `count` is 1.
   - `data` must have at least one element.
   - The distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for (x, y) in data:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each `(x, y)` pair in `data`.
   - For each iteration, the loop checks if the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`.
   - If the condition is met, `max_overlap` is updated.

4. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - After the first iteration, `count` will be incremented by 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `data` and the distance condition is met for those elements.
   - Since `count` is initially 1, after the first iteration, `count` becomes 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `data` must still have at least one element, and the distance condition must be met for at least one of the remaining elements.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `cross_points` remains unchanged since the loop body is omitted and no new points are added to it in this context.
   - `max_overlap` is updated based on the current iteration but needs to reflect the potential for another iteration.
   - `count` becomes 2.
   - `data` must have at least one element and the distance condition must be met for at least one of the remaining elements.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`cross_points` is a non-empty list, `max_overlap` is equal to the number of elements in `data` for which the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`, `count` is 2, `data` must have at least one element, and the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS` for at least one of the remaining elements.**
