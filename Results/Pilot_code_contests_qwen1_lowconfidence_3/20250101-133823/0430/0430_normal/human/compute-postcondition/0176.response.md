Postcondition: ***`j` is incremented by 1. `data` remains a list of tuples. `RADIUS` and `RADIUS_2` remain as \(1 + 1e-12\) and \(2 + 1e-12\) respectively. `num_data` remains a positive integer. `cross_points` is a list of all valid points. `x2` and `y2` are the first and second elements of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data` respectively. `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.

If `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`, then `cp1` and `cp2` are both equal to `x2, y2`.

Otherwise, `cross_points` includes the new points \((x1 + \cos(th + al), y1 + \sin(th + al))\) and \((x1 + \cos(th - al), y1 + \sin(th - al))\), where `th` is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\), and `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`. `cp2` is updated to \((x1 + \cos(th - al), y1 + \sin(th - al))\).***
