The code snippet appends `cp2` to the list `cross_points`. The value of `cp2` is not specified in the initial state, so it cannot be determined what `cp2` contains. However, based on the condition given, if `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, then `cp1` would be appended to `cross_points`. Since `cp2` is not dependent on `cp1`, the condition for appending `cp1` does not affect the appending of `cp2`.

Therefore, the only change is that `cp2` is appended to `cross_points`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1` and is less than `num_data`; `data` is a list of tuples; `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\); `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\); `num_data` is a positive integer; `cross_points` is a list of all valid points with `cp2` appended; `x2` is the first element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`; `y2` is the second element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`; `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\); `th` is the angle in radians calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`; `al` is `math.acos(distance)`.
