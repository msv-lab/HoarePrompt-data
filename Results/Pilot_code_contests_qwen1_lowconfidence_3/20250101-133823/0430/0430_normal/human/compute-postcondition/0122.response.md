The code `cross_points.append(cp2)` appends the value of `cp2` to the list `cross_points`. Based on the initial state, we know that `cross_points` already contains one element `cp1`. The value of `cp2` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `cp2` was previously defined based on the conditions given.

Output State: **`x2` is `data[j][0]`, `y2` is `data[j][1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(data[j][0] - x1, data[j][1] - y1)`, `cross_points` is a list with elements `cp1` and `cp2`, `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))` and both coordinates of `cp1` are within the range [0.0, 10.0], the value of `cp2` is undefined.**
