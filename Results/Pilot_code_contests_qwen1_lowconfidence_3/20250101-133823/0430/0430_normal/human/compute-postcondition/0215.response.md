`max_overlap` is reassigned to the value of `count`. Since `count` is the total number of elements in `data` for which the distance condition is satisfied, and `max_overlap` was previously less than `count`, this reassignment ensures that `max_overlap` is now equal to `count`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cross_points` is a non-empty list, `max_overlap` is equal to `count`, `count` is the total number of elements in `data` for which the distance condition is satisfied, `data` is an empty list.

Output State: **`cross_points` is a non-empty list, `max_overlap` is equal to `count`, `count` is the total number of elements in `data` for which the distance condition is satisfied, `data` is an empty list**
