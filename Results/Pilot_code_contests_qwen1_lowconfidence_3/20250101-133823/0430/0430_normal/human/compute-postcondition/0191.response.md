According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `data` list. The loop iterates over each pair `(x, y)` in `data`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
- `cross_points` is a non-empty list.
- `count` is either 0 or 1.
- `(x, y)` is the first element in the `data` list.

The condition for the loop to continue executing is that there are more pairs `(x, y)` left in the `data` list to iterate over. Since `(x, y)` was the first element in the `data` list at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, the next element `(x, y)` must exist in the `data` list.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `cross_points` remains a non-empty list.
- `count` remains either 0 or 1.
- `(x, y)` changes to the second element in the `data` list.

State: **`cross_points` is a non-empty list, `count` is either 0 or 1, and `(x, y)` is the second element in the `data` list.**
