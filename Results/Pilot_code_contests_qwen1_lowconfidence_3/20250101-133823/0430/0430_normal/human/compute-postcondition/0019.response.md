The code calculates the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` using the `math.hypot` function. This distance is stored in the variable `distance`. Since `x1` and `y1` are the first and second elements of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, and `x2` and `y2` are the first and second elements of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, the `distance` variable will hold the specific value calculated from these points. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` must be at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is an empty list, `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `i` equals `j`, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.**
