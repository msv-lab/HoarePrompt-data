The code changes the value of `al` from `math.acos(distance / RADIUS)` to `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`. Given the initial state, `distance` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, and the value of `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\).

Since `distance` is defined as \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\), we can substitute this into the new expression for `al`:
\[ al = \mathbf{math.acos}\left(\left(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\right)^2 / (2.0 \cdot \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2})\right) \]
\[ al = \mathbf{math.acos}\left(\frac{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}{2.0 \cdot \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}}\right) \]

This simplifies to:
\[ al = \mathbf{math.acos}\left(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2} / (2.0)\right) \]
\[ al = \mathbf{math.acos}\left(\frac{\text{distance}}{2.0}\right) \]

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is less than `num_data`, `data` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `cross_points` is a list of all valid points that satisfy the conditions within the loop, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\) and is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is now `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, `x1` is the first element of the \((num_data - 1)\)-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the \((num_data - 1)\)-th tuple in `data`, and \(x1 \neq x2\) or \(y1 \neq y2\)**
