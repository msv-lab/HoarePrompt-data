The code `x1, y1 = data[i]` updates the values of `x1` and `y1` to the first and second elements of the \(i\)-th tuple in the `data` list, respectively. Given the previous state where `i` was set to `num_data - 1`, the new values of `x1` and `y1` will be the first and second elements of the \((num_data - 1)\)-th tuple in `data`. 

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated states are:
- `x1` is the first element of the \((num_data - 1)\)-th tuple in `data`.
- `y1` is the second element of the \((num_data - 1)\)-th tuple in `data`.
- All other variables (`RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `num_data`, `data`, `cross_points`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, `th`, and `al`) retain their previous values.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two floats, `cross_points` is a list of all valid points that satisfy the conditions within the loop, `j` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / RADIUS)`, `x1` is the first element of the \((num_data - 1)\)-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the \((num_data - 1)\)-th tuple in `data`.**
