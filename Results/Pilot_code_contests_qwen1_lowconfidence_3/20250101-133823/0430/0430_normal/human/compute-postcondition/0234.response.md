The code `print(max_overlap)` does not modify any variables. It simply prints the value of `max_overlap`. The value of `max_overlap` is unchanged after this line of code is executed.

Output State: **`cross_points` is a non-empty list, `max_overlap` is the maximum count of elements in `data` for which the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`.**
