The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats, `j` is `j_old + 1`, `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `cp1` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta + \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta + \alpha))\), `cp2` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\), `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, `cross_points` is a list that may include `cp1` if `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, and `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`, depending on whether `distance <= RADIUS_2` is true or false.**
