The code `th = math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)` calculates the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)`. However, since `x1` and `y1` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `th`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is a list containing `cp1` and `cp2` if they meet the specified range conditions, otherwise it remains as previously stated; `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `th` is the angle in radians calculated using `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, where `x1` and `y1` are not specified.**
