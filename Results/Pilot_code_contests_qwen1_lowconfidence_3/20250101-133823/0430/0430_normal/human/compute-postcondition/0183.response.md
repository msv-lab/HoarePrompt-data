Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two floats, `cross_points` is a list of all valid points that satisfy the conditions within the loop, `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `distance` is \( \mathit{math.hypot}(x2 - x1, y2 - y1) \), `th` is the angle calculated by \( \mathit{math.atan2}(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) \), `al` is \( \mathit{math.acos}(\frac{\mathit{distance}^2}{2.0 \times \mathit{distance}}) \), and both `cp1` and `cp2` are valid points within the range [0.0, 10.0] if they exist.**
