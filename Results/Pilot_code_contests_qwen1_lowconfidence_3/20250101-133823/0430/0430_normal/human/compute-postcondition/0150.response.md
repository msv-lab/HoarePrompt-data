According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `num_data`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `num_data`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `j` is less than `num_data`
- `data` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple
- `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
- `num_data` is a positive integer
- `cross_points` is a list of all valid points
- `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`
- `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`
- `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\)

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `j + 1`. The condition `j < num_data` must still hold true.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is `j + 1` and is less than `num_data`, `data` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `cross_points` is a list of all valid points, `x2` is the first element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\)**.
