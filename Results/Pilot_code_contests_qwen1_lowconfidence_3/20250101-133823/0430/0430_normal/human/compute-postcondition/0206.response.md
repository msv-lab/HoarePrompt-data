Postcondition: ***`cross_points` is a non-empty list. `max_overlap` is equal to the number of elements in `data` for which the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`. `count` is 1, `data` must have at least one element, and the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`.***
