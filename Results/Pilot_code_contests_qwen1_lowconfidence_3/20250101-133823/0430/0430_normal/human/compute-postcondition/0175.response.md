Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`; `data` is a list of tuples; `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\); `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\); `num_data` is a positive integer; `cross_points` is a list of all valid points plus the new point \((x1 + \cos(th + al), y1 + \sin(th + al))\) plus another point \((x1 + \cos(th - al), y1 + \sin(th - al))\); `x2` is the first element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`; `y2` is the second element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`; `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\); `th` is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\) calculated as `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`; `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`; `cp2` is \((x1 + \cos(th - al), y1 + \sin(th - al))\).**
