`al` is assigned the value of `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`. The value of `distance` is calculated as \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\), and `x2` and `y2` are the first and second elements of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`, respectively. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1` and is less than `num_data`; `data` is a list of tuples; `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\); `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\); `num_data` is a positive integer; `cross_points` is a list of all valid points; `x2` is the first element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`; `y2` is the second element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`; `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\); `th` is the angle in radians calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`; `al` is `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`.**
