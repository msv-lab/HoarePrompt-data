The code assigns `x1, y1` to both `cp1` and `cp2`. Since `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, the values of `cp1` and `cp2` are both `x1, y1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` must be at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is an empty list, `cp1` is `x1, y1`, `cp2` is `x1, y1`, `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, and the distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` must be at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is an empty list, `cp1` is `x1, y1`, `cp2` is `x1, y1`, `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, and the distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`.**
