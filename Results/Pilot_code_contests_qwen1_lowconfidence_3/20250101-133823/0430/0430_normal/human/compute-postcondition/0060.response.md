`al` is assigned the value of `math.acos(distance)`, but the value of `distance` is not provided. However, the value of `th` is calculated using `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, which depends on `x2` and `y2`. The value of `cp1` is then updated to `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`. Since the exact values of `x1`, `y1`, and `distance` are not given, we cannot compute the exact coordinates of `cp1`. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is a list containing `cp1` and `cp2` if they meet the specified range conditions, otherwise it remains as previously stated; `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `th` is the angle in radians calculated using `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is assigned the value of `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1` is updated to `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`**.
