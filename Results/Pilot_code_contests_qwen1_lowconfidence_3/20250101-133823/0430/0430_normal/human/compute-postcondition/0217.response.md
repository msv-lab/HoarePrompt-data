According to the code, the loop iterates over each element `(cx, cy)` in the `cross_points` list. Whether the loop can execute again depends on the size of the `cross_points` list.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `cross_points` is a non-empty list.
- `max_overlap` equals `count`.
- `count` represents the total number of elements in `data` that satisfy the distance condition. The value of `max_overlap` and `count` remains unchanged whether the condition `max_overlap < count` is true or false.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `cross_points` list must still contain at least one more element. Since `cross_points` is a non-empty list, it must contain at least one element to start with. Therefore, for the loop to continue executing, `cross_points` must contain more than one element.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `cross_points` contains at least two elements, as the first element has already been processed in the previous iteration.

State: **`cross_points` is a non-empty list that must contain at least two elements, `max_overlap` equals `count`, and `count` represents the total number of elements in `data` that satisfy the distance condition.**
