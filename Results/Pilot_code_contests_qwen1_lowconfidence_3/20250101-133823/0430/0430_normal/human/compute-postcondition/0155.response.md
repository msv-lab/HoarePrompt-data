The code assigns `x1, y1` to both `cp1` and `cp2`. The values of `x1` and `y1` are derived from the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`, which means `x1` is the first element and `y1` is the second element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`. The values of `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `num_data`, `cross_points`, and `distance` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1` and is less than `num_data`; `data` is a list of tuples; `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\); `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\); `num_data` is a positive integer; `cross_points` is a list of all valid points; `x2` is the first element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`; `y2` is the second element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`; `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\); `cp1` is `x1, y1`; `cp2` is `x1, y1`.**
