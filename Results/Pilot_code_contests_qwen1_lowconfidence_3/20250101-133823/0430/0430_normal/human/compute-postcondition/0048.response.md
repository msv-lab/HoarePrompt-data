Postcondition: ***`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is a list containing `cp1` (if the condition \(0.0 \leq cp1[0] \leq 10.0\) and \(0.0 \leq cp1[1] \leq 10.0\) is true) or it remains unchanged (if the condition is false) plus `cp2`, `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than `num_data`. If the condition \(0.0 \leq cp1[0] \leq 10.0\) and \(0.0 \leq cp1[1] \leq 10.0\) is true, `cp1` is appended to `cross_points`. Otherwise, `j` is incremented by 1, `th` is the angle in radians between the vectors from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)`, `cp1` is updated to \(x1 + \cos(th + al), y1 + \sin(th + al)\), and `cp2` is updated to \(x1 + \cos(th - al), y1 + \sin(th - al)\).***
