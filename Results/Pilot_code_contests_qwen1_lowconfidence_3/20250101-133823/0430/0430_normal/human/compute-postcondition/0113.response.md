The `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)` function calculates the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`. This function replaces the value of `distance` with the computed distance. However, the initial values of `x2` and `y2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x2` is `data[j][0]`, `y2` is `data[j][1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(data[j][0] - x1, data[j][1] - y1)`**
