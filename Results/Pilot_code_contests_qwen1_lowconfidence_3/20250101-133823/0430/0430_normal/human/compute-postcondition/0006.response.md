According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `num_data` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` must be greater than 0, and `data` is a list containing one tuple where each element is a float.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num_data` must still be greater than 0. Since `num_data` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it means `num_data` is now equal to 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `num_data` must be greater than 0, and since it was exactly 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it must be incremented to 1 for the loop to continue.

The state of `RADIUS` and `RADIUS_2` does not change within the loop based on the given information, so they remain the same. The list `data` also remains unchanged.

State: **`RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list containing one tuple where each element is a float** 

However, to execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust `num_data` to be greater than 0. Therefore, the state should reflect that `num_data` is now 1 (or more, but the minimum condition is met).

State: **`RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list containing one tuple where each element is a float, `num_data` is 1**
