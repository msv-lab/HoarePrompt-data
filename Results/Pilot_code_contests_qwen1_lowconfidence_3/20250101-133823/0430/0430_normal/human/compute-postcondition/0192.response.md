`count` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `count` is `count + 1`. The value of `cross_points` and `(x, y)` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cross_points` is a non-empty list, `count` is either 1 or 2 (depending on its original value), and `(x, y)` is the second element in the `data` list.

Output State: **`cross_points` is a non-empty list, `count` is either 1 or 2, and `(x, y)` is the second element in the `data` list.**
