The code appends a tuple of floats read from `stdin` (standard input) to the list `data`. Since no specific input is provided, we cannot determine the exact values of the appended tuple. However, we know that the tuple is created from the split input values.

Let's assume the input from `stdin` is "1.1,2.2". This means the tuple created would be `(1.1, 2.2)`.

Therefore, after appending this tuple to `data`, the list `data` will contain three elements: the original tuple and the newly added tuple.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` is 2, `data` is a list containing two tuples: (a tuple from the initial state and (1.1, 2.2))**
