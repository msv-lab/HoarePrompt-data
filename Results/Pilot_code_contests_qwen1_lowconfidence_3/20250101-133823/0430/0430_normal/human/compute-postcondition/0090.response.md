The code appends `cp2` to the list `cross_points`. The previous values of the variables are as follows:

- `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
- `num_data` is a positive integer
- `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats
- `j` is incremented by 1
- `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`
- `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`
- `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`
- `cp1` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta + \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta + \alpha))\)
- `cp2` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\)
- `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`
- `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`
- `cross_points` is a list including `cp1` if `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, otherwise `cross_points` remains unchanged. Additionally, the current value of `cp2[0]` is within the range \([0.0, 10.0]\) and the current value of `cp2[1]` is within the range \([0.0, 10.0]\).

Since `cp2` meets the condition to be appended to `cross_points`, the updated `cross_points` list will include `cp2`.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `cp1` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta + \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta + \alpha))\), `cp2` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\), `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, `cross_points` is a list including `cp1` if `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, otherwise `cross_points` remains unchanged, and `cross_points` now includes `cp2`.**
