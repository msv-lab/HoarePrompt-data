To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions under which the given for loop can start executing.

The for loop iterates over the range from 0 to `num_data - 1`, where `num_data` is a positive integer. The loop body is omitted but based on the context provided, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop starts with `j = 0` and increments by 1 until `j < num_data`.
   - Therefore, `j` must be initialized to 0 for the loop to start.

2. **List `data`:**
   - `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples, where each tuple contains two floats.
   - For the loop to start, `data` must contain at least one tuple (since `num_data` is a positive integer).

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `x2` and `y2` are the first and second elements of the `j`-th tuple in `data`.
   - Since the loop starts with `j = 0`, `x2` and `y2` should be initialized to the values of the first tuple in `data`.

4. **Distance Condition:**
   - The problem statement mentions that the distance between \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\) is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`. However, since the loop itself is defined only by `j`, this condition is internal to the loop and doesn't directly affect the initialization state needed for the loop to execute.

### Required Adjustments:

Based on the above analysis, the necessary adjustments to the initial state before the loop starts are as follows:

- `j` should be initialized to 0.
- `data` must contain at least one tuple (since `num_data` is a positive integer).

Given the provided information and the loop definition, the relevant adjustments are:

State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats, `j` is 0**.
