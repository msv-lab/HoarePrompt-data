Output State: **n is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of stickers. Each coordinate pair xi, yi is a real number with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and the center of each sticker is within the bounds of the 10x10 origami paper (0 ≤ xi ≤ 10 and 0 ≤ yi ≤ 10). The code provided does not affect the variables or their values.**

The given code is a comment referencing a website, which does not modify any variables or perform any operations. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
