`count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` is 0, so after executing `count += 1`, the new value of `count` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cross_points` is a non-empty list, `max_overlap` is equal to the number of elements in `data` for which the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`, `count` is 1, `data` must have at least one element, and the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`**
