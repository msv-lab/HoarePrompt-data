The code assigns the values from the `i`-th tuple in the `data` list to `x1` and `y1`. Since the `data` list contains tuples of floats, `x1` will be the first element of the `i`-th tuple, and `y1` will be the second element of the `i`-th tuple. However, the actual values of `x1` and `y1` cannot be determined without knowing the specific elements of the `i`-th tuple in `data`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples where each tuple contains floats, `cross_points` is an empty list, `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`**
