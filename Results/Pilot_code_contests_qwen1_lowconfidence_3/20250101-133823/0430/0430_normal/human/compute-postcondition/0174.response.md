The code updates the `cross_points` list with a new point `(cp1)`. The point `cp1` is calculated using the formula for a point on a circle given by rotating the point `(x1, y1)` by an angle `th + al`. The values of `x1` and `y1` come from the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in the `data` list. The angle `th` is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, and `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, where `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.

Since the exact values of `x1`, `y1`, `th`, and `al` are not specified, we will keep them in their symbolic form. The new point `cp1` is added to the `cross_points` list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`; `data` is a list of tuples; `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\); `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\); `num_data` is a positive integer; `cross_points` is a list of all valid points plus the new point \((x1 + \cos(th + al), y1 + \sin(th + al))\); `x2` is the first element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`; `y2` is the second element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`; `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\); `th` is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\) calculated as `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`; `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`.
