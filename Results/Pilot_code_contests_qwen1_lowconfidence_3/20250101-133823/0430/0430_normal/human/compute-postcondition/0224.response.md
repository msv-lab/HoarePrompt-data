`count` is incremented by 1, meaning its new value is the original value plus 1. The initial conditions regarding `data` and the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`data` is a non-empty iterable with at least two elements, count is original value + 1, and the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` must be checked for the next element `(x, y)`**
