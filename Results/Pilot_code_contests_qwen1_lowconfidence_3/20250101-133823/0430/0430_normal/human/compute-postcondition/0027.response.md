`cp2` is assigned the value `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `th`, `al`, and `x2`, `y2` are used to calculate the new coordinates for `cp2`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` is at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is an empty list, `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `th` is math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1), `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\), `al` is math.acos(distance / 2.0), `cp1` is (x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)), `cp2` is (x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))**
