The code assigns the values of `x1` and `y1` to both `cp1` and `cp2`. This means that `cp1` and `cp2` now both hold the values of `x1` and `y1`. The values of `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `num_data`, `data`, and `j` remain unchanged. The conditions for `cross_points` and the calculation of `distance` also remain unaffected because the assignment does not involve these variables.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is a list containing either `cp1` (if the condition \(0.0 \leq cp1[0] \leq 10.0\) and \(0.0 \leq cp1[1] \leq 10.0\) is true) or it remains unchanged (if the condition is false) plus `cp2`, `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than `num_data`, `cp1` is `x1, y1`, `cp2` is `x1, y1`, and the distance calculation remains unchanged.**
