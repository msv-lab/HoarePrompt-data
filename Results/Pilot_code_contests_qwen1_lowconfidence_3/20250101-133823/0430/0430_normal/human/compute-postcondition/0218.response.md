The code sets `count` to 0, which initializes `count` to 0. The values of `cross_points` and `max_overlap` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`cross_points` is a non-empty list that must contain at least two elements, `max_overlap` equals `count`, `count` is 0**
