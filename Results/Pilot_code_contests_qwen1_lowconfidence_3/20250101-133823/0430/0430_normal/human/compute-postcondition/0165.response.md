Postcondition: ***`j` is `j + 1` and is less than `num_data`; `data` is a list of tuples; `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\); `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\); `num_data` is a positive integer; `cross_points` is a list of all valid points; `x2` is the first element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`; `y2` is the second element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`; `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\); if `distance <= RADIUS_2`, `cross_points` has `cp2` appended if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
