Postcondition: ***`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`. `cp1` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta + \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta + \alpha))\) and `cp2` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))`, where `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)` and `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`. Additionally, the current value of `cp1[0]` is within the range [0.0, 10.0] and the current value of `cp1[1]` is within the range [0.0, 10.0].***

Note: In this postcondition, the variables `x1`, `y1`, `theta`, and `alpha` are assumed to retain their values from the precondition. The postcondition includes the constraints on `cp1` derived from the if condition.
