The code appends the value of `cp1` to the list `cross_points`. The value of `cp1` depends on the conditions specified in the initial state. If `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`, then `cp1` is `x1` and `cp2` is `y1`. Otherwise, `cp1` is calculated as `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`.

Since the code does not change the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `th`, `al`, `cp2`, `data`, `j`, `distance`, or `math` itself, only the value of `cp1` is appended to `cross_points`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x2` is `data[j][0]`, `y2` is `data[j][1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(data[j][0] - x1, data[j][1] - y1)`, `cross_points` is a list with an additional element `cp1`, and if `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`, then `cp1` is `x1` and `cp2` is `y1`; otherwise, `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`.**
