The code initializes two variables `RADIUS` and `RADIUS_2` with specific values. These assignments do not affect the initial values of `n` or the coordinates of the stickers. Therefore, the only change is in the new values of `RADIUS` and `RADIUS_2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100, `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12**
