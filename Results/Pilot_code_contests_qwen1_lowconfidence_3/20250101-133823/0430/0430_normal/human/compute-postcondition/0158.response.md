The code `cp1 = x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)` creates a new point `cp1` by calculating its x and y coordinates using trigonometric functions based on the given angle `th + al`. 

- `x1` and `y1` are the coordinates of the starting point, which remain unchanged.
- `th` is the angle in radians calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.
- `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, where `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\).

The new point `cp1` is created as follows:
- The x-coordinate of `cp1` is `x1 + math.cos(th + al)`
- The y-coordinate of `cp1` is `y1 + math.sin(th + al)`

Other variables such as `j`, `num_data`, `data`, `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `cross_points`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, and `th` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1` and is less than `num_data`; `data` is a list of tuples; `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\); `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\); `num_data` is a positive integer; `cross_points` is a list of all valid points; `x2` is the first element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`; `y2` is the second element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`; `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\); `th` is the angle in radians calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`; `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`.
