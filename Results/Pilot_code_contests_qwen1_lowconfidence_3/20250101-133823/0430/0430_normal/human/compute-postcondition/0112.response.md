The code assigns `data[j][0]` to `x2` and `data[j][1]` to `y2`. Since the initial state does not specify the content of `data`, we can only state that `x2` and `y2` are assigned the first and second elements of `data[j]` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x2` is `data[j][0]`, `y2` is `data[j][1]`, and the other variables remain unchanged.**
