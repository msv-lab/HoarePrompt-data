The code appends a tuple of floats, converted from a line read from standard input, to the `data` list. Since the initial state specifies that `data` is a list containing one tuple where each element is a float and `num_data` is 1, the code will modify the `data` list by adding another tuple.

Given the initial state:
- `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
- `num_data` is 1
- `data` is a list containing one tuple where each element is a float

After executing the code, `data` will contain two tuples. However, since the problem does not specify what values are entered via `stdin.readline().split(',')`, we can only state that a new tuple has been added to the list.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` is 2, `data` is a list containing two tuples where each element is a float**
