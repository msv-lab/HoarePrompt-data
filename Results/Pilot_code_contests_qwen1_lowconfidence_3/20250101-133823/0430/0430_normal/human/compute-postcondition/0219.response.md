According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `data`. The loop will execute if `data` is a non-empty iterable that contains at least one pair of elements `(x, y)`.

Let's break down the requirements:

1. **`cross_points`**: This is mentioned as a non-empty list that must contain at least two elements. However, this variable is not directly relevant to the execution of the loop itself but rather to the initial state or setup.
   
2. **`max_overlap`**: This variable equals `count`, and `count` is initially 0. These values do not affect the execution of the loop directly; they are used within the loop body.

3. **`data`**: For the loop to execute, `data` must be a non-empty iterable that contains at least one pair of elements `(x, y)`. 

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `data` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one element `(x, y)`.

State: **`data` is a non-empty iterable with at least one element `(x, y)`**
