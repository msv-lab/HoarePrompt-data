The code `cp2 = x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)` calculates the coordinates of a new point `cp2` using trigonometric functions based on the angle `th - al`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state, except for `cp2`.

Let's break down the calculation:
- The x-coordinate of `cp2` is `x1 + math.cos(th - al)`
- The y-coordinate of `cp2` is `y1 + math.sin(th - al)`

Since `th` and `al` are already defined as:
- `th` is the angle in radians calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`
- `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, where `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\)

The output state remains unchanged for all variables except `cp2`, which is now defined by the new coordinates.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1` and is less than `num_data`; `data` is a list of tuples; `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\); `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\); `num_data` is a positive integer; `cross_points` is a list of all valid points; `x2` is the first element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`; `y2` is the second element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`; `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\); `th` is the angle in radians calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`; `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`, and `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`.
