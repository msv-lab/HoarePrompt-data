`max_overlap` is assigned the value of `count`. The value of `count` remains unchanged from its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cross_points` is a non-empty list, `count` is the number of elements in `data` for which the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`, `max_overlap` is equal to `count`**
