Postcondition: ***`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is a list containing `cp1` and `cp2` if they meet the specified range conditions, now also containing `cp1` if the if condition is true, `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2` conditions remain the same as initially described, otherwise `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `th` is the angle in radians calculated using `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is assigned the value of `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1` is updated to `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`, and `cp2` is updated to `x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)`***
