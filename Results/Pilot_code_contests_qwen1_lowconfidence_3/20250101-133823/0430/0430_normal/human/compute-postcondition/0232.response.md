Postcondition: ***`data` is a non-empty iterable, `max_overlap` is equal to the original value of `count`, and `count` is the number of elements in `data` for which the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` holds. If `max_overlap` is less than `count`, no changes are made to `max_overlap` and `count` remains as the original value of `count`.***
