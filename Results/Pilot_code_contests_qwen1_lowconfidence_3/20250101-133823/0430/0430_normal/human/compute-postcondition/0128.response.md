Let's analyze the given state and the for loop to determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given State:
- `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
- `num_data` is a positive integer
- `data` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two floats
- `cross_points` is a list of all valid points that satisfy the conditions within the loop
- `j` is `num_data - 1`
- `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`
- `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`
- `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`
- `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`
- `al` is `math.acos(distance / RADIUS)`
- `x1` is the first element of the \((num_data - 1)\)-th tuple in `data`
- `y1` is the second element of the \((num_data - 1)\)-th tuple in `data`

### For Loop:
```
for j in range(num_data):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`:** The loop will iterate from `0` to `num_data - 1`. Since `j` is already set to `num_data - 1` (the last index), the loop will start at the last element and go backwards if the loop body includes decrementing `j`.

2. **Condition for Execution:** The for loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `num_data`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is less than `num_data`.

3. **Initial Values:** We need to ensure that `data` is not empty, otherwise, the loop won't execute at all because `range(num_data)` would return an empty sequence.

### Adjusted States:
- `j` must be less than `num_data` to ensure the loop executes.
- `data` must contain at least one tuple to ensure the loop has elements to iterate over.

### Final Answer:
State: **`j` is less than `num_data`, `data` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `cross_points` is a list of all valid points that satisfy the conditions within the loop, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / RADIUS)`, `x1` is the first element of the \((num_data - 1)\)-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the \((num_data - 1)\)-th tuple in `data`**.
