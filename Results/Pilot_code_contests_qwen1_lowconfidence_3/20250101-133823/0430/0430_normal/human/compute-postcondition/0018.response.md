The code `x2, y2 = data[j]` extracts the `j`-th tuple from the list `data` and assigns the first and second elements of that tuple to `x2` and `y2`, respectively. The values of `x1` and `y1` are not directly referenced in this line of code, so they remain unchanged. The states of the other variables (`RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `num_data`, `data`, `cross_points`, and `i`) are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
**`RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` must be at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is an empty list, `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, and `i` equals `j`, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`.**
