Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. The initial state includes:
   - `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
   - `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
   - `num_data` is at least 1
   - `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple
   - `cross_points` is a list containing `cp1` and `cp2` if they meet the specified range conditions, otherwise it remains as previously stated
   - `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`
   - `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`
   - `th` is the angle in radians calculated using `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`
   - `al` is assigned the value of `math.acos(distance)`
   - `cp1` is updated to `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`

2. The code snippet:
   ```python
   cp2 = x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)
   ```

This code updates the value of `cp2` to a new point based on the current values of `x1`, `y1`, `th`, and `al`. Specifically:
- `cp2` is set to the coordinates `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`.

Since no other variables are affected, the output state will include the updated value of `cp2` while keeping all other variables as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is a list containing `cp1` and `cp2` if they meet the specified range conditions, otherwise it remains as previously stated, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `th` is the angle in radians calculated using `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is assigned the value of `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1` is updated to `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`, `cp2` is updated to `x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)`**
