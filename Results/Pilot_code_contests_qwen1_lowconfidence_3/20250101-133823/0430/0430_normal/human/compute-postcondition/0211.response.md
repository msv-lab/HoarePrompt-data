`count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` is either 3 or remains 2, so after incrementing, `count` will be 4 if it was initially 3, or it will become 3 if it was initially 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cross_points` is a non-empty list, `max_overlap` is either equal to the current value plus 1 or remains the same, `count` is 4 if it was initially 3 or 3 if it was initially 2, `data` must have at least one element remaining, and the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS` for the next element in the list**
