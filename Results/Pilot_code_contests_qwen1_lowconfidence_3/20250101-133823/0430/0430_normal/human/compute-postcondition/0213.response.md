Output State: **`cross_points` is a non-empty list, `max_overlap` is equal to the number of elements in `data` for which the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`, `count` is the total number of elements in `data` for which the distance condition is satisfied, `data` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `(x, y)` in the `data` list and checks if the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`. For each iteration where the condition is true, `count` is incremented.
- After all iterations, `count` will be the total number of elements in `data` for which the distance condition is satisfied.
- Since `data` is a list, the loop will stop when there are no more elements left to check. Therefore, at the end of the loop, `data` will be an empty list.
- `cross_points` remains unchanged throughout the loop and is mentioned in the initial state as a non-empty list, indicating it might be used elsewhere in the program but is not affected by the loop itself.
- `max_overlap` is also mentioned in the initial state and is not altered by the loop, so it retains its initial value, which is the number of elements in `data` that satisfy the distance condition.
