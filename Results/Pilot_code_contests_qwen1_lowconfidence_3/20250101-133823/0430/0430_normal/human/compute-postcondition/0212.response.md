Postcondition: ***`cross_points` is a non-empty list, `max_overlap` is either equal to the current value plus 1 or remains the same, `count` is 4 if it was initially 3 or 3 if it was initially 2, `data` must have at least one element remaining, and the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS` for the next element in the list. This holds true whether the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` is satisfied or not.***
