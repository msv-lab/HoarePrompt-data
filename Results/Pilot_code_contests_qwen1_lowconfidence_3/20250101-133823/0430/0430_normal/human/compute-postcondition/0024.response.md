`th` is assigned the value of `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`. This function calculates the angle in radians between the positive x-axis of a plane and the point given by the coordinates (x2 - x1, y2 - y1). The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged. The states of the other variables (`RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `num_data`, `data`, `cross_points`, `i`, and `j`) are not affected.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` must be at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is an empty list, `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `i` equals `j`, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `th` is math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1), and the distance between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is greater than x1 == x2 and y1 == y2.**
