The code `x2, y2 = data[j]` extracts the elements from the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in the list `data` and assigns them to `x2` and `y2`, respectively. This changes the values of `x2` and `y2` but does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1` and is less than `num_data`, `data` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `cross_points` is a list of all valid points, `x2` is the first element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\).**
