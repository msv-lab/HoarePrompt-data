The code assigns the values of `x1` and `y1` to both `cp1` and `cp2`. The values of `x1` and `y1` are derived from the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in the `data` list, specifically `x2` and `y2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `cp1` is equal to `x1, y1`
- `cp2` is equal to `x1, y1`

Since `x1` and `y1` are the first and second elements of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`, respectively, we can express `cp1` and `cp2` in terms of `x2` and `y2`:

- `cp1` is equal to `x2, y2`
- `cp2` is equal to `x2, y2`

The other variables (`j`, `data`, `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `num_data`, `cross_points`, `x2`, `y2`, and `distance`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `data` is a list of tuples, `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `cross_points` is a list of all valid points, `x2` is the first element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, `cp1` is equal to `x2, y2`, `cp2` is equal to `x2, y2`.**
