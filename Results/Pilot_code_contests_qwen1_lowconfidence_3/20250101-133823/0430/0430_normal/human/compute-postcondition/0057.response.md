The code assigns the values of `x1` and `y1` to `cp1` and `cp2`. Since `x1` and `y1` are not specified in the initial state, it implies that `cp1` and `cp2` are assigned the values of `x1` and `y1`, respectively. However, since `x1` and `y1` are not defined, this assignment does not provide specific values for `cp1` and `cp2`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `cp1` and `cp2` are now holding the values of `x1` and `y1`, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is a list containing `cp1` and `cp2` if they meet the specified range conditions, otherwise it remains as previously stated; `cp1` is `x1`, `cp2` is `y1`.**
