The code updates the value of `cp1` based on the given formulas involving `x1`, `y1`, `th`, and `al`. Let's break down the steps:

1. `cp1` is assigned the value `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`.
2. `th` is calculated as `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.
3. `distance` is calculated as `\(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\)`.
4. `al` is calculated as `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`.

However, since `cp1` is the only variable being updated, the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

So, the output state will include the updated value of `cp1` and the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` is at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is an empty list, `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `th` is math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1), `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\), `al` is math.acos(distance / 2.0), `cp1` is (x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))**
