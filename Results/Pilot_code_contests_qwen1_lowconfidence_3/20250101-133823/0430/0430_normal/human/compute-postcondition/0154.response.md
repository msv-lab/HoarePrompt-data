The code updates the `distance` variable to be the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, calculated using the `math.hypot` function, which computes \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\).

The initial state includes:
- `j` is `j + 1` and is less than `num_data`
- `data` is a list of tuples
- `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
- `num_data` is a positive integer
- `cross_points` is a list of all valid points
- `x2` is the first element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`
- `y2` is the second element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`
- `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\)

After executing the code snippet, the `distance` variable is updated to the value of \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1` and is less than `num_data`; `data` is a list of tuples; `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\); `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\); `num_data` is a positive integer; `cross_points` is a list of all valid points; `x2` is the first element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`; `y2` is the second element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`; `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\)**.
