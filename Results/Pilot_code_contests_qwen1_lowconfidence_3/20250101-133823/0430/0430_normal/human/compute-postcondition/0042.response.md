The code calculates the angle `th` using `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`. This function computes the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point `(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`. 

Given that `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, and `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, and `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than `num_data`, the value of `j` changes, but `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain the same.

Therefore, the Output State is: `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is a list containing either `cp1` (if the condition \(0.0 \leq cp1[0] \leq 10.0\) and \(0.0 \leq cp1[1] \leq 10.0\) is true) or it remains unchanged (if the condition is false) plus `cp2`, `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `j` is incremented by 1 and is now `j + 1` and is less than `num_data`, and `th` is the angle in radians between the vectors from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)`.
