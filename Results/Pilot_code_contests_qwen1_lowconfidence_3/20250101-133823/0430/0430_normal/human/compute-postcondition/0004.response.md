According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_data`. The loop will only execute if `num_data` is greater than 0.

Let's break down the initial state:

- `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100 (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12.
- `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12.
- `num_data` is an integer read from standard input (unknown value initially).
- `data` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, `num_data` must be greater than 0.

State: **`RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` must be greater than 0, `data` is an empty list**
