Postcondition: ***`j` is less than `num_data`, `data` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `cross_points` is a list of all valid points, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\). If `distance <= RADIUS_2`, then:
- If `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / RADIUS)` and `cp2` is `x1, y1`.
- Otherwise, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)` and `cp2` is the tuple \((x1 + \cos(th - al), y1 + \sin(th - al))\).***
