Postcondition: ***`j` is less than `num_data`, `data` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `cross_points` is a list of all valid points that satisfy the conditions within the loop, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\) and is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / RADIUS)`, `x1` is the first element of the \((num_data - 1)\)-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the \((num_data - 1)\)-th tuple in `data`. The current values of `x1` and `y1` are equal to the current values of `x2` and `y2` respectively.***
