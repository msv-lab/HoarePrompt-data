Postcondition: ***`x2` is `data[j][0]`, `y2` is `data[j][1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(data[j][0] - x1, data[j][1] - y1)`, `cross_points` is a list with an additional element `cp1`. If `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`, then `cp1` is `x1` and `cp2` is `y1`. Otherwise, `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`, and `cp1[0]` is within the range [0.0, 10.0] and `cp1[1]` is within the range [0.0, 10.0].***
