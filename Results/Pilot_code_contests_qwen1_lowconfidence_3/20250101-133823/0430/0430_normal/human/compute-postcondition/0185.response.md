To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop condition and any initial conditions that might affect its execution.

The loop is defined as follows:
```python
for (cx, cy) in cross_points:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each pair `(cx, cy)` in the `cross_points` list. Therefore, the loop will execute if `cross_points` is not an empty list.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
   - `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
   - `num_data` is a positive integer
   - `data` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two floats
   - `cross_points` is a list of all valid points that satisfy the conditions within the loop
   - `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`
   - `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`
   - `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`
   - `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`
   - `distance` is \( \mathit{math.hypot}(x2 - x1, y2 - y1) \)
   - `th` is the angle calculated by \( \mathit{math.atan2}(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) \)
   - `al` is \( \mathit{math.acos}(\frac{\mathit{distance}^2}{2.0 \times \mathit{distance}}) \)
   - `max_overlap` is 0

3. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `cross_points` not being an empty list, we need to ensure that `cross_points` is non-empty for the loop to execute.

### Final Answer:
State: **`cross_points` is a non-empty list**.

This ensures that there are points in `cross_points` for the loop to iterate over. The values of `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `num_data`, `data`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, `th`, `al`, and `max_overlap` are not directly related to the loop's ability to execute based on the given information.
