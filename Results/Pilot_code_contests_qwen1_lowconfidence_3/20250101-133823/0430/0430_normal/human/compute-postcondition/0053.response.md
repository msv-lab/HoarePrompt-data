The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the code inside the loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop context provided, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is a list containing `cp1` and `cp2` if they meet the specified range conditions, otherwise it remains as previously stated.**
