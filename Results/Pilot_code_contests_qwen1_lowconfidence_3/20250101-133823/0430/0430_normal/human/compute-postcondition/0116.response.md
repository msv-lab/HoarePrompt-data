The code `al = math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))` calculates the value of `al` using the formula for the angle in a triangle given the distance. Given that `distance` is already calculated as `math.hypot(data[j][0] - x1, data[j][1] - y1)`, the value of `al` will be calculated based on this distance.

Let's denote the distance as \( d \), so the expression becomes:
\[ al = \arccos\left(\frac{d^2}{2d}\right) = \arccos\left(\frac{d}{2}\right) \]

Since `distance` is already defined as `math.hypot(data[j][0] - x1, data[j][1] - y1)`, the value of `al` is calculated using this specific distance.

Output State: **`x2` is `data[j][0]`, `y2` is `data[j][1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(data[j][0] - x1, data[j][1] - y1)`, `th` is `math.atan2(data[j][1] - y1, data[j][0] - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`**
