The code updates the value of `cp2` based on the existing values of `x1`, `y1`, `th`, and `al`. Let's break down the steps:

1. `cp2` is defined as `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`.
2. From the initial state, we know:
   - `x1` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`.
   - `y1` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`.
   - `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, where `x2` and `y2` are the elements of the tuple at index `j`.
   - `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, where `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)` and is greater than `RADIUS_2`.

Given these, `cp2` will be updated as follows:
- The first element of `cp2` is `x1 + math.cos(th - al)`.
- The second element of `cp2` is `y1 + math.sin(th - al)`.

The other variables (`RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `num_data`, `data`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, `th`, and `al`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12; `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12; `num_data` is a positive integer; `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats; `j` is `j + 1`; `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`; `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`; `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)` and is greater than `RADIUS_2`; `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`; `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`; `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`; `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`.**
