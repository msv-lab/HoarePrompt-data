Postcondition: ***`x2` is `data[j][0]`, `y2` is `data[j][1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(data[j][0] - x1, data[j][1] - y1)`, `cross_points` is a list with elements `cp1` and `cp2`. If `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`, the value of `cp2` is undefined. Otherwise, `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))` and both coordinates of `cp1` are within the range [0.0, 10.0].***
