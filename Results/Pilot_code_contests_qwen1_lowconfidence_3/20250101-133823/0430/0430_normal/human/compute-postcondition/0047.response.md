Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
   - `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
   - `num_data` is at least 1
   - `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple
   - `cross_points` is a list containing either `cp1` (if the condition \(0.0 \leq cp1[0] \leq 10.0\) and \(0.0 \leq cp1[1] \leq 10.0\) is true) or it remains unchanged (if the condition is false) plus `cp2`
   - `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`
   - `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`
   - `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`
   - `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`
   - `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than `num_data`
   - If `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`, then `cp1` and `cp2` are both set to `(x1, y1)`
   - Otherwise, `th` is the angle in radians between the vectors from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)`, `cp1` is updated to \(x1 + \cos(th + al), y1 + \sin(th + al)\), and `cp2` is updated to \(x1 + \cos(th - al), y1 + \sin(th - al)\)

2. The code snippet:
   ```python
   cross_points.append(cp1)
   ```

   This line appends `cp1` to the `cross_points` list. Since `cp1` was already part of the `cross_points` list, this does not change the number of elements in `cross_points`, but it ensures that `cp1` is added to `cross_points` again.

Given that the conditions for setting `cp1` and `cp2` remain unchanged and `cross_points` already contains `cp1` before this operation, the only change is that `cp1` is appended again to `cross_points`.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is a list containing `cp1` (if the condition \(0.0 \leq cp1[0] \leq 10.0\) and \(0.0 \leq cp1[1] \leq 10.0\) is true) or it remains unchanged (if the condition is false) plus `cp2`, `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than `num_data`, `cp1` is appended to `cross_points`.**
