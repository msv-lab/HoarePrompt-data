The code snippet `distance = math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)` calculates the Euclidean distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`. However, the initial state does not specify the values of `x1` and `y1`. Since these values are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `distance`. But we know that `x2` is the first element of `data[j]` and `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`.

The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is a list containing `cp1` and `cp2` if they meet the specified range conditions, otherwise it remains as previously stated; `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is calculated as `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)` where `x1` and `y1` are not specified.**
