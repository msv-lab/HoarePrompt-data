The code appends `cp1` to the `cross_points` list. Since the exact values of `cp1`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `th`, and `al` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `cp1`. However, we know the following:

- `j` is `j + 1` and is less than `num_data`.
- `data` is a list of tuples.
- `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\).
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\).
- `num_data` is a positive integer.
- `cross_points` is a list of all valid points.
- `x2` is the first element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`.
- `y2` is the second element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`.
- `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\).
- `th` is the angle in radians calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.
- `al` is `math.acos(distance)`.

The only change made by the code is appending `cp1` to `cross_points`.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1` and is less than `num_data`; `data` is a list of tuples; `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\); `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\); `num_data` is a positive integer; `cross_points` is a list of all valid points including `cp1`; `x2` is the first element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`; `y2` is the second element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`; `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\); `th` is the angle in radians calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`; `al` is `math.acos(distance)`.
