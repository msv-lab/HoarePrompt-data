To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the relevant parts of the provided information:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
   - `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
   - `num_data` is a positive integer
   - `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats
   - `j` is `j_old + 1`
   - `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`
   - `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`
   - `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`
   - `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`
   - `al` is \(\math.acos(\text{distance}^2 / (2.0 \times \text{distance}))\)
   - `cp1` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta + \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta + \alpha))\)
   - `cp2` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\)

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - If `distance <= RADIUS_2`, then `cp2` is added to `cross_points` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`.
   - If `distance > RADIUS_2`, `cross_points` remains unchanged.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

3. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(num_data):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop variable `j` starts from `j_old + 1` at the beginning of the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `num_data`.
   - Since `j` is `j_old + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `j` should be `j_old + 2`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `j` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, so `j` will be `j_old + 2`.
   - The values of `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, `th`, `al`, `cp1`, and `cp2` depend on the current tuple in the `data` list at index `j`. Since `j` changes, these values will be recalculated based on the new tuple in `data` at index `j`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The only state that needs to be explicitly adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `j`.

**State:**
State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats, `j` is `j_old + 2`, `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is \(\math.acos(\text{distance}^2 / (2.0 \times \text{distance}))\), `cp1` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta + \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta + \alpha))\), `cp2` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\). If `distance <= RADIUS_2`, then `cp2` is added to `cross_points` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`. If `distance > RADIUS_2`, `cross_points` remains unchanged. All other variables remain unchanged.**
