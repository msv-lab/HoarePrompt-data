According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cross_points`. The loop iterates over each element in `cross_points`. At the end of the last iteration, `cross_points` is a non-empty list, and `max_overlap` is equal to the number of elements in `data` for which the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must hold:
1. `cross_points` must still be a non-empty list.
2. The loop must move to the next element in `cross_points`.

Since the loop is iterating over `cross_points`, at the start of the next iteration, `cross_points` will contain all elements except the one that was processed in the previous iteration. Therefore, `cross_points` remains a non-empty list.

The state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `cross_points` is a non-empty list (since it still contains at least one element).
- `max_overlap` remains unchanged as it does not depend on the current value of `(cx, cy)` in the loop.

State: **`cross_points` is a non-empty list, `max_overlap` is equal to the number of elements in `data` for which the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`**
