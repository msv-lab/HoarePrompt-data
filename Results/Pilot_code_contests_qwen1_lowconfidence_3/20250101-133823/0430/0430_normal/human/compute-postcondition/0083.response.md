Let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
   - `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
   - `num_data` is a positive integer (though its exact value doesn't affect the calculation of `cp1`)
   - `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats
   - `j` is incremented by 1 (so `j` is now `j + 1`)
   - `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`
   - `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`
   - `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)` and is greater than `RADIUS_2`
   - `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`
   - `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code assigns `cp1` to the coordinates `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`.
     - Here, `math.cos(th + al)` computes the cosine of the angle `th + al`.
     - Similarly, `math.sin(th + al)` computes the sine of the angle `th + al`.

3. **Output State Calculation:**
   - Since `cp1` is computed based on the current values of `x1`, `y1`, `th`, and `al`, the new value of `cp1` will be `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\); `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\); `num_data` is a positive integer; `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats; `j` is `j + 1`; `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`; `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`; `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)` and is greater than `RADIUS_2`; `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`; `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`; `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`.**
