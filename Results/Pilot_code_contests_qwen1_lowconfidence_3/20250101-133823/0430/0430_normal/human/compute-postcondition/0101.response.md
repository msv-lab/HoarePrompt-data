The code updates the value of `cp1` using the expressions for `x1` and `y1`, `th`, and `al`. Specifically, `cp1` is updated to be `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`. Other variables remain unchanged.

- `RADIUS` remains \(1 + 1e-12\)
- `RADIUS_2` remains \(2 + 1e-12\)
- `num_data` remains a positive integer
- `data` remains a list of at least one tuple containing two floats
- `j` remains `j_old + 1`
- `x2` remains the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`
- `y2` remains the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`
- `distance` remains `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`
- `cp2` remains \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\)
- `th` remains the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`
- `al` remains \(\text{math.acos(distance}^2 / (2.0 \times \text{distance}))\)
- `cross_points` remains a list that includes `cp1` and `cp2` under certain conditions
