Postcondition: ***`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats, `j` is `j_old + 1`, `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is \(\math.acos(\text{distance}^2 / (2.0 \times \text{distance}))\), `cp1` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta + \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta + \alpha))\), `cp2` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\). If `distance <= RADIUS_2`, then `cp2` is added to `cross_points` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`. If `distance > RADIUS_2`, `cross_points` remains unchanged. All other variables remain unchanged.***
