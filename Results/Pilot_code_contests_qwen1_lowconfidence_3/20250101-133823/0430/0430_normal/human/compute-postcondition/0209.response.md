Postcondition: ***`cross_points` is a non-empty list, `max_overlap` is equal to the number of elements in `data` for which the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`, `count` is either 3 or remains 2, `data` must have at least one element, and the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS` for at least one of the remaining elements. If the distance condition in the if statement is true, `count` becomes 3. Otherwise, `count` remains 2.***
