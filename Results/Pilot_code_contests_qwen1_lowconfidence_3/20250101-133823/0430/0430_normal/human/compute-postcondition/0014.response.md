Let's break down the given conditions and the for loop to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Conditions:
1. `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12.
2. `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12.
3. `num_data` must be greater than 0.
4. `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples where each tuple contains floats.
5. `cross_points` is an empty list.
6. `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`.
7. `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`.

### For Loop:
```
for j in range(num_data):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The for loop iterates over `num_data` items. The loop will execute as long as `j` (the loop variable) is within the range from 0 to `num_data - 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm the following:
1. `num_data` must be greater than 0 (already given).
2. The list `data` must contain at least one tuple (since `num_data` is at least 1).

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can proceed.

### Adjusted States:
- Ensure `num_data` is at least 1.
- Ensure `data` contains at least one tuple.

### Final State:
State: **`RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` must be at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is an empty list, `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`**
