The code snippet `cross_points.append(cp1)` appends the value of `cp1` to the list `cross_points`. Based on the initial state and the conditions provided:

- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `data` remains a list of tuples.
- `RADIUS` and `RADIUS_2` remain as \(1 + 1e-12\) and \(2 + 1e-12\) respectively.
- `num_data` remains a positive integer.
- `cross_points` is a list of all valid points.
- `x2` and `y2` are the first and second elements of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data` respectively.
- `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.

The impact of the code is that `cp1` (which could be `x2, y2` if `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`) is appended to the list `cross_points`. Since `cp1` is not defined within this snippet and we don't have the exact values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and whether `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`, we assume `cp1` retains its last known value before the append operation. However, we know that `cp1` was either `x2, y2` if `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`, or the computed points otherwise.

Therefore, the list `cross_points` now includes all previously valid points plus `cp1`.

Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `data` remains a list of tuples, `RADIUS` and `RADIUS_2` remain as \(1 + 1e-12\) and \(2 + 1e-12\) respectively, `num_data` remains a positive integer, `cross_points` is a list of all valid points including `cp1`, `x2` and `y2` are the first and second elements of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data` respectively, and `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.**
