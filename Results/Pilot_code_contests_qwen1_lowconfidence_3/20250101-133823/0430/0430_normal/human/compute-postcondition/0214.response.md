Postcondition: **`cross_points` is a non-empty list, `max_overlap` is equal to the number of elements in `data` for which the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`, `count` is the total number of elements in `data` for which the distance condition is satisfied, `data` is an empty list, and `max_overlap` is less than `count`**
