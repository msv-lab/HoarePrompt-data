The code snippet defines `cp2` using the values from `x1`, `y1`, `th`, and `al`. Let's break it down:

1. `x1` and `y1` are the coordinates of the \((num_data - 1)\)-th tuple in `data`.
2. `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.
3. `al` is the angle calculated by `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, where `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\) and is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`.

The new point `cp2` is defined as:
\[ cp2 = (x1 + \cos(th - al), y1 + \sin(th - al)) \]

Given these details, we can summarize the changes:
- `cp2` is a new tuple that represents a point calculated based on the existing variables `x1`, `y1`, `th`, and `al`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is less than `num_data`, `data` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `cross_points` is a list of all valid points that satisfy the conditions within the loop, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\) and is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is now `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, `x1` is the first element of the \((num_data - 1)\)-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the \((num_data - 1)\)-th tuple in `data`, `x1 \neq x2` or `y1 \neq y2`, and `cp2` is the tuple \((x1 + \cos(th - al), y1 + \sin(th - al))\).**
