`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `data` remains a non-empty iterable with at least one element `(x, y)`, and the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` still holds for the current element `(x, y)`.

Output State: **`data` is a non-empty iterable with at least one element `(x, y)`, `count` is increased by 1, and the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, y) <= RADIUS` still holds for the current element `(x, y)`**
