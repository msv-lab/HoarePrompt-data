Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two floats, `cross_points` is a list of all valid points that satisfy the conditions within the loop, `x1` is the first element of the \((i+1)\)-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the \((i+1)\)-th tuple in `data`, `j` is `num_data - 1` after the last iteration, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`, `cp1` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta + \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta + \alpha))\) and `cp2` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\), and `cross_points` contains all valid `cp1` and `cp2` points that meet the conditions within the loop and are within the range [0.0, 10.0].**

Explanation:
- After the loop completes, `i` and `j` will iterate through all possible combinations of tuples in `data` except for the case where `i == j`.
- The loop calculates `cp1` and `cp2` for each pair of points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` where the distance between them is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`.
- If the calculated points `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range [0.0, 10.0], they are appended to `cross_points`.
- Since the loop iterates over all pairs of points in `data`, the final state of `cross_points` will include all such valid points after the loop has completed.
