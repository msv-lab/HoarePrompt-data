The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, the provided code snippet does not show which loop this statement is within, so we assume it is inside a loop where `i` and `j` are being compared. Since the condition `(i == j)` is true and `continue` is executed, the loop will skip to the next iteration without changing any variable values.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats, `j` is 0, and the condition `(i == j)` is true (the loop continues to the next iteration)**
