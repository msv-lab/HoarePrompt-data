According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_data`. The loop will execute as long as `num_data` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` is 2, and `data` is a list containing two tuples where each element is a float.

Since the loop runs based on `num_data`, and `num_data` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it means that two iterations of the loop have already occurred. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_data` must be decremented by 1 and should still be greater than 0.

Therefore, `num_data` will be reduced by 1, making it 1. Since `num_data` is still greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` is 1, `data` is a list containing two tuples where each element is a float**
