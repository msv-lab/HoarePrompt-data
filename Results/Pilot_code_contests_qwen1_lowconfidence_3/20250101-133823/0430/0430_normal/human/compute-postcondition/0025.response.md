First, let's break down the given code and initial state:

### Initial State Variables:
- `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
- `num_data` is at least 1
- `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple
- `cross_points` is an empty list
- `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`
- `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`
- `i` equals `j`
- `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`
- `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`
- `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`
- The distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is greater than `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`.

### Given Code:
```python
al = math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Distance Calculation:**
   - The `distance` between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula: \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\).
   - This distance is stored in the variable `distance`.

2. ** acos Function Usage:**
   - The variable `al` is assigned the value of `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`.
   - This function is used to compute the angle in radians from the cosine value.

### Simplifying the Expression:
- Let \(d\) represent the distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, i.e., \(d = \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\).

The expression inside the `acos` function can be simplified:
\[ \text{expression} = d^2 / (2.0 \cdot d) = d / 2.0 \]

Therefore, the value of `al` is:
\[ al = \mathbf{\mathbf{math.acos(d / 2.0)}} \]

### Output State:
- The only variable affected by the given code is `al`, which is assigned the value `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` is at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is an empty list, `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `i` equals `j`, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `th` is math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1), `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\), and `al` is math.acos(distance / 2.0).**
