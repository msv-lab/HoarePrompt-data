Let's break down the problem step by step to understand how the states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial States:
- `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
- `num_data` is a positive integer (let's denote it as `N`)
- `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats (each tuple is in the form `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are the coordinates)
- `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration (initially `j` is 0)
- `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`
- `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`
- `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`
- `cp1` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta + \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta + \alpha))\)
- `cp2` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\)
- `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`
- `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`
- `cross_points` is a list that may include `cp1` and `cp2` based on the conditions provided

### End of Previous Iteration:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so if `j` was `j_old` before, now `j = j_old + 1`.
- The loop continues if `j < num_data`.

### Adjusting the States:
To determine the new states at the start of the next iteration:

1. **Increment `j`**: Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we update `j` to `j_old + 1`.
2. **Update `x2` and `y2`**: These values depend on the tuple at index `j` in the list `data`. Therefore, `x2` and `y2` become the first and second elements of the tuple at index `j` in `data`, respectively.
3. **Update `distance`**: This value is recalculated using the updated `x2` and `y2` values.
4. **Update `cp1` and `cp2`**: These points are calculated using the updated `distance`, `x1`, `y1`, `theta`, and `alpha`.
5. **Update `th`**: This angle is recalculated using the updated `x2` and `y2` values.
6. **Update `al`**: This value is recalculated using the updated `distance`.
7. **Update `cross_points`**: The list `cross_points` may include `cp1` and `cp2` if the conditions are met.

Given the above steps, the states at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats, `j` is `j_old + 1`, `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `cp1` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta + \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta + \alpha))\), `cp2` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\), `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, `cross_points` is a list that may include `cp1` if `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, and `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`, depending on whether `distance <= RADIUS_2` is true or false.**
