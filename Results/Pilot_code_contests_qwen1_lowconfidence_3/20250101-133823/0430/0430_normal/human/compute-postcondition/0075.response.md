`x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the tuple in the list `data` at index `j`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1 because the condition `(i == j)` is true, which causes the loop to continue to the next iteration. However, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, and `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`.**
