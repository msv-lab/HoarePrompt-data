The code `al = math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))` introduces a new variable `al` which is assigned the value of the inverse cosine (arccos) of `distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance)`. However, the value of `distance` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot directly calculate the value of `al`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is a list containing `cp1` and `cp2` if they meet the specified range conditions, otherwise it remains as previously stated; `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `th` is the angle in radians calculated using `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is assigned the value of `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`.**
