According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_data`. The loop will only execute if `num_data` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, we know the following:

- `RADIUS` is set to \(1 + 1e-12\).
- `RADIUS_2` is set to \(2 + 1e-12\).
- `num_data` is the number of tuples read from standard input.
- `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples where each tuple contains floats.
- `cross_points` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, `num_data` must be greater than 0 because the loop runs for each value of `i` in the range of `num_data`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `num_data` is greater than 0.

State: **`RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples where each tuple contains floats, `cross_points` is an empty list**
