`count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The list `cross_points`, the coordinates `(x, y)`, and the condition about the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cross_points` is a non-empty list, `count` is 1, `(x, y)` is the first element in the `data` list, and the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`.

Output State: **`cross_points` is a non-empty list, `count` is 1, `(x, y)` is the first element in the `data` list, and the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`**
