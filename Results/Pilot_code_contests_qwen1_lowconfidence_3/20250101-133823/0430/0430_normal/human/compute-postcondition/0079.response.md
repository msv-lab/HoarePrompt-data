The code `cp1 = cp2 = x1, y1` assigns the values of `x1` and `y1` to both `cp1` and `cp2`. Given that `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, and the initial state is `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, the values of `cp1` and `cp2` will be the same as `x1` and `y1`.

The initial states are:
- `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
- `num_data` is a positive integer
- `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats
- `j` is incremented by 1
- `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`
- `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`
- `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)` and it is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`
- `x1` is equal to `x2`
- `y1` is equal to `y2`

After executing the code `cp1 = cp2 = x1, y1`, the values of `cp1` and `cp2` will be `x1` and `y1`, which are equal to `x2` and `y2`.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)` and it is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, `x1` is equal to `x2`, `y1` is equal to `y2`, `cp1` is `x1`, `cp2` is `y1`**.
