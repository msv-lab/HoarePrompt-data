The code updates the `distance` variable using the `math.hypot` function, which calculates the Euclidean distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`. However, the initial state does not specify the values of `x1` and `y1`. Therefore, we can only express `distance` in terms of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.

Given the initial state:
- `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
- `num_data` is a positive integer
- `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats
- `j` is incremented by 1
- `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`
- `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`

After the code runs, the following changes occur:
- `distance` is set to `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`

Since `x1` and `y1` are not specified, `distance` remains expressed in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)**
