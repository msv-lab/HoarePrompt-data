`max_overlap` is assigned the value of `count`. The previous value of `max_overlap` was less than `count`, but now it is equal to `count`. The value of `count` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a non-empty iterable, `max_overlap` is equal to `count`, `count` is the number of elements in `data` for which the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` holds**
