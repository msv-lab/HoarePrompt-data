The code `cp1 = cp2 = x1, y1` updates both `cp1` and `cp2` to be equal to `x1, y1`. This means that `cp1` and `cp2` no longer refer to their previously defined values involving trigonometric functions but instead hold the values of `x1` and `y1`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged: `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats, `j` is `j_old + 1`, `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, and `cross_points` is a list that may include `cp1` if `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, and `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`, depending on whether `distance <= RADIUS_2` is true or false. If `i == j`, `cross_points` remains unchanged; otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged.
