The code `distance = math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)` calculates the Euclidean distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `x1` and `y1`. Since these values are not provided, they remain undefined.

The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `data` is a list of tuples, `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `cross_points` is a list of all valid points, `x2` is the first element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`, and `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.**
