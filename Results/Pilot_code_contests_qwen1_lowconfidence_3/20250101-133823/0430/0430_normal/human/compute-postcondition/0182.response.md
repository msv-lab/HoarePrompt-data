Output State: **`j` is equal to `num_data`, `data` is a list of tuples, `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `cross_points` is a list of all valid points that satisfy the conditions within the loop, `x2` and `y2` are the first and second elements of the `j`-th tuple in `data` (which would be the last tuple since `j` equals `num_data`), `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\), `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, and `al` is `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`.**

Explanation:
- After the loop completes, `j` will be equal to `num_data` because the loop increments `j` from 0 to `num_data - 1` and stops when `j` equals `num_data`.
- `data` remains unchanged as it is used to access elements during each iteration of the loop.
- `RADIUS` and `RADIUS_2` remain constant as they are not modified within the loop.
- `num_data` remains unchanged as it is used to control the loop.
- `cross_points` collects all valid points that satisfy the conditions within the loop. A point is considered valid if it falls within the specified bounds [0.0, 10.0].
- `x2` and `y2` are the coordinates of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, which would be the last tuple since `j` equals `num_data`.
- `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\).
- `th` is the angle calculated using the `math.atan2` function based on the difference in coordinates.
- `al` is the angle calculated using the `math.acos` function based on the distance and the radius \(RADIUS_2\).

This output state captures the final state of the variables after the loop has completed its iterations.
