`num_data` is assigned the value of an integer read from standard input (`stdin.readline()`). The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the values of `RADIUS` and `RADIUS_2` also remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100, `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` is an integer read from standard input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100, `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` is an integer read from standard input**
