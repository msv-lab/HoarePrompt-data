The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, no specific variables are updated or affected by the `continue` statement itself. The conditions and values of the variables before the `continue` statement remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1` and is less than `num_data`, `data` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `cross_points` is a list of all valid points, `x2` is the first element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\)**
