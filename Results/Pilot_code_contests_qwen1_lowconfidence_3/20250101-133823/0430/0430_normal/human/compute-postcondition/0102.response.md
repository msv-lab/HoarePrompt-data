Let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
   - `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
   - `num_data` is a positive integer
   - `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats
   - `j` is `j_old + 1`
   - `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`
   - `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`
   - `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`
   - `cp1` is \((x1 + \math.cos(\theta + \alpha), y1 + \math.sin(\theta + \alpha))\)
   - `cp2` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\)
   - `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`
   - `al` is \(\math.acos(\text{distance}^2 / (2.0 \times \text{distance}))\)
   - `cross_points` is a list that includes `cp1` and `cp2` under certain conditions.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   cp2 = x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)
   ```

   This line updates the value of `cp2`. The original definition of `cp2` was \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\). Now, it is being updated to \((x1 + \math.cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\).

3. **Impact Analysis**:
   - The values of `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `num_data`, `data`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, `cp1`, `th`, `al`, and `cross_points` remain unchanged.
   - `cp2` is updated to \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\), which is identical to its previous value.

Therefore, the only change is in the value of `cp2`, but since it remains the same, it doesn't require a new representation. 

**Output State:**
- `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
- `num_data` is a positive integer
- `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats
- `j` is `j_old + 1`
- `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`
- `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`
- `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`
- `cp1` is \((x1 + \math.cos(\theta + \alpha), y1 + \math.sin(\theta + \alpha))\)
- `cp2` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\)
- `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`
- `al` is \(\math.acos(\text{distance}^2 / (2.0 \times \text{distance}))\)
- `cross_points` is a list that includes `cp1` and `cp2` under certain conditions.
