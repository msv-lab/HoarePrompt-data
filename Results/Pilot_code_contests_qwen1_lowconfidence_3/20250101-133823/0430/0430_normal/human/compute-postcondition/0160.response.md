Postcondition: ***`j` is `j + 1` and is less than `num_data`; `data` is a list of tuples; `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\); `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\); `num_data` is a positive integer; `cross_points` is a list of all valid points; `x2` is the first element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`; `y2` is the second element of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `data`; `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\); `th` is the angle in radians calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`; `al` is `math.acos(distance)`. If `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`, then `cp1` and `cp2` are both `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`. Otherwise, `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`.***
