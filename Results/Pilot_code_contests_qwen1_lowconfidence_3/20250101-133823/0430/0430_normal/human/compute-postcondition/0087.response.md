The code `cross_points.append(cp1)` appends the value of `cp1` to the list `cross_points`. The value of `cp1` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta + \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta + \alpha))\). Since no other variables are modified and the initial conditions remain unchanged except for the addition of `cp1` to the `cross_points` list, the output state is as follows:

- `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
- `num_data` is a positive integer
- `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats
- `j` is incremented by 1
- `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`
- `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`
- `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`
- `cp1` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta + \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta + \alpha))\)
- `cp2` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\)
- `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`
- `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`
- `cross_points` is a list that now includes `cp1`
