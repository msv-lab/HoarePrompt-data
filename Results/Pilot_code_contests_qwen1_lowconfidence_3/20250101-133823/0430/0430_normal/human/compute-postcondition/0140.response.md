The code creates a new point `cp1` using the formulas for converting polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates. The angle for this new point is `th + al`, where `th` is the angle between the two points, and `al` is the angle calculated based on the distance.

Given:
- `x1` is the first element of the `(num_data - 1)`-th tuple in `data`.
- `y1` is the second element of the `(num_data - 1)`-th tuple in `data`.
- `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.
- `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, and `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\).

The new point `cp1` is defined as:
- `cp1[0] = x1 + math.cos(th + al)`
- `cp1[1] = y1 + math.sin(th + al)`

Since no other variables are affected, the output state includes the updated value of `cp1` and the unchanged states of all other variables.

Output State: **`j` is less than `num_data`, `data` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `cross_points` is a list of all valid points that satisfy the conditions within the loop, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\) and is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is now `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, `x1` is the first element of the \((num_data - 1)\)-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the \((num_data - 1)\)-th tuple in `data`, and `x1 \neq x2` or `y1 \neq y2`; `cp1` is \((x1 + \cos(th + al), y1 + \sin(th + al))\)**.
