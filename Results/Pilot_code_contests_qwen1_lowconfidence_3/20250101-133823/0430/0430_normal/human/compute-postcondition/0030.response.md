`cross_points.append(cp1)` appends the value of `cp1` to the list `cross_points`. The value of `cp1` is already defined, and the `cross_points` list was initially empty. After appending `cp1`, the `cross_points` list now contains `cp1`.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` is at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is a list containing `cp1`, `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, the distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, and the coordinates of `cp1` satisfy \(0.0 \leq cp1[0] \leq 10.0\) and \(0.0 \leq cp1[1] \leq 10.0\).**
