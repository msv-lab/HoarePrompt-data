The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not indicate which loop this `continue` statement belongs to. Since the `continue` statement does not change any variable values or affect the conditions specified, the values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is a list containing either `cp1` (if the condition \(0.0 \leq cp1[0] \leq 10.0\) and \(0.0 \leq cp1[1] \leq 10.0\) is true) or it remains unchanged (if the condition is false) plus `cp2`, `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, and the distance between \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\) is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, and `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than `num_data`.**
