The code `al = math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))` calculates the value of `al` using the formula involving `distance`. Given that `distance` is defined as `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, which is the Euclidean distance between points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, and it is known that `distance > RADIUS_2`, we proceed with the calculation.

First, let's denote `d` as `distance` for simplicity. The expression for `al` becomes:
\[ al = \mathbf{acos}\left(\frac{d^2}{2.0 \cdot d}\right) \]

Simplifying the expression inside the `acos` function:
\[ al = \mathbf{acos}\left(\frac{d}{2.0}\right) \]

Since `d` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, the value of `al` is determined by this specific `d`. The value of `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `num_data`, `data`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, and `distance` remain unchanged from their initial conditions, and the `th` angle is also unaffected by this line of code.

Therefore, the updated output state is:
Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)` and is greater than `RADIUS_2`, `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`**
