Functionality: **The function processes a list of coordinate pairs representing the centers of circular stickers on a 10x10 origami paper. It calculates the intersection points of circles whose radii are slightly larger than 1 (to account for floating-point precision issues). For each intersection point, it counts how many original sticker centers lie within a circle of radius 1 centered at that point. Finally, it prints the maximum count of such intersections found for any point.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If no intersection points are found, `cross_points` will remain empty, and `max_overlap` will be 0.
- If all sticker centers overlap at a single point, `max_overlap` will be equal to the number of sticker centers.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle cases where the input list `data` is empty or contains invalid coordinates outside the 10x10 boundary. These should be checked and handled appropriately to ensure robustness.
