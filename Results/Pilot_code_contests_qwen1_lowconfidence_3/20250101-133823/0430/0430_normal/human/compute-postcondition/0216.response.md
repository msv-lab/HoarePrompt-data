Postcondition: ***`cross_points` is a non-empty list, `max_overlap` equals `count`, and `count` represents the total number of elements in `data` that satisfy the distance condition. The value of `max_overlap` and `count` remains unchanged whether the condition `max_overlap < count` is true or false.***
