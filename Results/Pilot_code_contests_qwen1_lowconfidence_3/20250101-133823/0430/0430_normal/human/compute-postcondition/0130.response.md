The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables outside the loop. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`j` is less than `num_data`, `data` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `cross_points` is a list of all valid points that satisfy the conditions within the loop, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / RADIUS)`, `x1` is the first element of the \((num_data - 1)\)-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the \((num_data - 1)\)-th tuple in `data`, and `i` equals `j`.**
