Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples where each tuple contains two floats, `cross_points` is a list of points that satisfy the conditions within the loop, `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, and the distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Values**: 
   - `RADIUS` is set to \(1 + 1e-12\).
   - `RADIUS_2` is set to \(2 + 1e-12\).
   - `num_data` is a positive integer, indicating the number of tuples in the list `data`.
   - `data` is a list of tuples, each containing two floats.
   - `cross_points` starts as an empty list.
   - `x1` and `y1` represent the coordinates of the `i`-th tuple in `data`.
   - `x2` and `y2` represent the coordinates of the `j`-th tuple in `data`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each tuple in `data` except for the one with the same index `i` (using the `continue` statement).
   - For each pair of tuples `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, the distance `distance` is calculated using `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`.
   - If `distance <= RADIUS_2`, two possible cross points `cp1` and `cp2` are computed based on the geometric relationship between the points.
   - Both `cp1` and `cp2` are checked to ensure they lie within the bounds \([0.0, 10.0]\) for both coordinates. If they do, they are appended to `cross_points`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes all iterations, `cross_points` will contain all valid cross points that satisfy the conditions within the loop.
   - The values of `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `num_data`, `data`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` will remain as they were initialized or updated during the loop, but `cross_points` will reflect the result of the loop's execution.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop executes is as described above.
