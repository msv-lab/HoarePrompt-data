Postcondition: ***`RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` is at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is an empty list, `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, and the distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, then `cp1` and `cp2` are both set to `(x1, y1)`. Otherwise, `cp1` is set to \((x1 + \cos(\theta + \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta + \alpha))\) and `cp2` is set to \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\), where \(\theta = \mathit{atan2}(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)\) and \(\alpha = \arccos(\frac{\text{distance}}{2.0})\).***
