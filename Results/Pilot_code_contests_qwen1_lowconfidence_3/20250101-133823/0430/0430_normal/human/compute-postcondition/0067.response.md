Postcondition: ***`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is a list containing `cp1` and `cp2`. If `distance <= RADIUS_2`, then:
- If the condition `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0` is true, `cp1` is updated to `x1 + \(\cos(\theta + \alpha)\), y1 + \(\sin(\theta + \alpha)\)` and `cp2` is updated to `x1 + \(\cos(\theta - \alpha)\), y1 + \(\sin(\theta - \alpha)\)`.
- Otherwise, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `th` is the angle in radians calculated using `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is assigned the value of `math.acos(distance)`, and `cp1` is updated to `x1 + \(\cos(\theta + \alpha)\), y1 + \(\sin(\theta + \alpha)\)` while `cp2` remains unchanged.***
