To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and analyze the loop condition.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
  - `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
  - `num_data` is at least 1
  - `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple
  - `cross_points` is a list containing either `cp1` (if the condition \(0.0 \leq cp1[0] \leq 10.0\) and \(0.0 \leq cp1[1] \leq 10.0\) is true) or it remains unchanged (if the condition is false) plus `cp2`
  - `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`
  - `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`
  - `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`
  - `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`
  - The distance between \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\) is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `num_data - 1`.

### Analysis:
For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must be incremented and should still be within the range specified by `num_data`.

### Steps to Adjust States:
1. **Increment `j`:**
   - The variable `j` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   
2. **Ensure `j` is within bounds:**
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and the loop runs until `j < num_data`, for the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `num_data`.

### Adjusted States:
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- The new value of `j` must be less than `num_data`.

### New State:
- `RADIUS` remains \(1 + 1e-12\).
- `RADIUS_2` remains \(2 + 1e-12\).
- `num_data` remains at least 1.
- `data` remains the same.
- `cross_points` remains the same.
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain the same as they are derived from the current tuple in the loop.
- The condition for the distance between \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\) must still be less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`.

Given these points, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is a list containing either `cp1` (if the condition \(0.0 \leq cp1[0] \leq 10.0\) and \(0.0 \leq cp1[1] \leq 10.0\) is true) or it remains unchanged (if the condition is false) plus `cp2`, `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, and the distance between \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\) is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, and `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than `num_data`.**
