The code `th = math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)` calculates the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)`. Given the initial state, the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are not specified, but we know that `distance` is greater than `RADIUS_2`. The values of `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `num_data`, `data`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, and `distance` remain unchanged except for the addition of the variable `th`, which is calculated based on `x2` and `y2`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)` and is greater than `RADIUS_2`, `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`**.
