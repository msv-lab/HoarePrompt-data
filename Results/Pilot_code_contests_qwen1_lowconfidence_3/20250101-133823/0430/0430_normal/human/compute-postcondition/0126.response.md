Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
   - `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
   - `num_data` is a positive integer
   - `data` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two floats
   - `cross_points` is a list of all valid points that satisfy the conditions within the loop
   - `x1` is the first element of the \((i+1)\)-th tuple in `data`
   - `y1` is the second element of the \((i+1)\)-th tuple in `data`
   - `j` is `num_data - 1` after the last iteration
   - `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`
   - `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`
   - `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`
   - `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`
   - `al` is `math.acos(distance / RADIUS)` (assuming this is the correct formula, otherwise it should be adjusted based on the context)

2. **Loop Condition**:
   The loop runs from `0` to `num_data - 1`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `num_data - 1` because `j` is `num_data - 1`.
   - For the next iteration to occur, `i` must be incremented and still be less than `num_data`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `i + 1`.
   - Since `i` was `num_data - 1` in the last iteration, the new value of `i` will be `num_data` (but since it's a range loop, the next valid value is `0` if it exceeds `num_data - 1`).

5. **Other States**:
   - `x1` and `y1` will be updated to the first and second elements of the \((i + 1)\)-th tuple in `data`.
   - `j` will be `num_data - 1` again for the current iteration.

6. **Final State for Next Iteration**:
   - The new value of `i` will be `0` (since the loop starts again from `0`).
   - `x1` and `y1` will be the first and second elements of the 1st tuple in `data` (index `0`).
   - `x2` and `y2` will be the first and second elements of the `j`-th tuple, which is still the last tuple in `data` (index `num_data - 1`).
   - `distance` will be recalculated as `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`.
   - `th` will be recalculated as `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.
   - `al` will be recalculated as `math.acos(distance / RADIUS)`.

Therefore, the state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two floats, `cross_points` is a list of all valid points that satisfy the conditions within the loop, `x1` is the first element of the 1st tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the 1st tuple in `data`, `j` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / RADIUS)`**.
