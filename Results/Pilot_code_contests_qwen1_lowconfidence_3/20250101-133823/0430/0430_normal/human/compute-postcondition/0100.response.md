First, let's identify the variables that are potentially affected by the code snippet:

- `al` is being reassigned from `math.acos(distance / 2.0)` to `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`.

Let's analyze the impact step-by-step:

1. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
   - `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
   - `num_data` is a positive integer
   - `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats
   - `j` is `j_old + 1`
   - `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`
   - `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`
   - `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`
   - `cp1` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta + \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta + \alpha))\)
   - `cp2` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\)
   - `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`
   - `al` is initially `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`
   - `cross_points` is a list that includes `cp1` and `cp2` under certain conditions.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `al = math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))` reassigns `al` to a new value based on the updated formula.

Since `distance` is already defined and hasn't changed, we only need to compute the new value of `al` using the new formula.

Given that `distance` is a non-zero value (as `data` contains tuples of floats and `hypot` ensures this), the new value of `al` is computed as follows:
\[ al = \mathbf{\text{math.acos(distance}^2 / (2.0 \times \text{distance}))} \]

The other variables remain unchanged as there is no assignment or operation affecting them directly by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\); `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\); `num_data` is a positive integer; `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats; `j` is `j_old + 1`; `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`; `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`; `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`; `cp1` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta + \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta + \alpha))\); `cp2` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\); `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`; `al` is \(\text{math.acos(distance}^2 / (2.0 \times \text{distance}))\); `cross_points` is a list that includes `cp1` and `cp2` under certain conditions.**
