To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions specified within the loop. The loop iterates over `num_data`, and the state variables change based on certain conditions.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
   - `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
   - `num_data` is at least 1
   - `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple
   - `cross_points` is a list containing `cp1` (if the condition \(0.0 \leq cp1[0] \leq 10.0\) and \(0.0 \leq cp1[1] \leq 10.0\) is true) or it remains unchanged (if the condition is false) plus `cp2` and `cp2` (if `j` was incremented and the condition for `cp1` was not met).

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for each `j` in the range `range(num_data)`.

3. **Loop Body Analysis**:
   - The loop increments `j`.
   - Depending on the conditions, `cp1` and `cp2` are either appended to `cross_points` if they meet the specified range conditions, or `j` is incremented and new values for `cp1` and `cp2` are computed.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - At the end of the last iteration, `j` would have been incremented up to but not exceeding `num_data - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented such that it reaches `num_data`.

5. **Conditions**:
   - Since `num_data` is at least 1, the loop will execute if `j` is incremented to `num_data - 1` (i.e., `j` becomes `num_data - 1` at the end of the last iteration).
   - For the next iteration, `j` should be `num_data` to allow the loop to continue.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `num_data`, and the conditions for appending `cp1` and `cp2` to `cross_points` need to be considered based on their current states.

### Final State:
- `RADIUS` remains \(1 + 1e-12\)
- `RADIUS_2` remains \(2 + 1e-12\)
- `num_data` remains the same (at least 1)
- `data` remains a list containing at least 1 tuple
- `cross_points` may or may not have additional entries depending on the conditions for `cp1` and `cp2`.

State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is a list containing `cp1` and `cp2` if they meet the specified range conditions, otherwise it remains as previously stated.**
