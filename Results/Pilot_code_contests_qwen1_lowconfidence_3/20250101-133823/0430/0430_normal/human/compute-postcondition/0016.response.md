The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` must be at least 1, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `cross_points` is an empty list, `x1` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `data`, and `i` equals `j`.**
