The code `x1, y1 = data[i]` assigns the first element of the \((i+1)\)-th tuple in `data` to `x1` and the second element of the same tuple to `y1`. 

The previous state was:
- `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\)
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\)
- `num_data` is a positive integer
- `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples where each tuple contains two floats
- `cross_points` is a list of points that satisfy the conditions within the loop
- `x1` is the first element of the \((i+1)\)-th tuple in `data`
- `y1` is the second element of the \((i+1)\)-th tuple in `data`
- `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`
- `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`
- The distance between \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\) is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`

After executing the code, `x1` and `y1` are updated to the values of the first and second elements of the \((i+1)\)-th tuple in `data`, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples where each tuple contains two floats, `cross_points` is a list of points that satisfy the conditions within the loop, `x1` is the first element of the \((i+1)\)-th tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the \((i+1)\)-th tuple in `data`, `x2` is the first element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the `j`-th tuple in `data`, and the distance between \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\) is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`**.
