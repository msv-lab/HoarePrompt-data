The code initializes a new variable `count` to 0. This does not affect the values of `cross_points` or `max_overlap`. Therefore, the only change is the addition of the variable `count` with the value 0.

Output State: **`cross_points` is a non-empty list, `max_overlap` is equal to the number of elements in `data` for which the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`, `count` is 0**
