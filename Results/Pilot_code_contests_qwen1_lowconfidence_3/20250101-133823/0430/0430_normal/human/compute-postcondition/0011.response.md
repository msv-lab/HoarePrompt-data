The line `cross_points = []` initializes an empty list named `cross_points`. This operation does not affect the values of `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `num_data`, or `data`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `cross_points` list.

Output State: **`RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `num_data` is the number of tuples read from standard input, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples where each tuple contains floats, `cross_points` is an empty list**
