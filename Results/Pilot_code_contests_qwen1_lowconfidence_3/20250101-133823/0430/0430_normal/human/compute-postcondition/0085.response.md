Postcondition: ***`RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `num_data` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of at least one tuple containing two floats, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` is the first element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `y2` is the second element of the tuple in `data` at index `j`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, `cp1` is `x1`, and `cp2` is `y1`. Otherwise, `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, `cp1` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta + \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta + \alpha))\), and `cp2` is \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\).***
