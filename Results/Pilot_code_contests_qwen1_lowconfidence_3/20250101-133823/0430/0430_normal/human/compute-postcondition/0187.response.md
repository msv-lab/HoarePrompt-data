State: **`cross_points` is a non-empty list, `count` is 0, `(x, y)` must be the first element in the `data` list**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop iterates over each pair `(x, y)` in the `data` list.
2. For the loop to execute, `data` must contain at least one element since the loop is iterating over pairs from `data`.
3. At the start of the loop, `(x, y)` should be the first element in the `data` list, as this is what the loop will process in the first iteration.
4. `count` being 0 does not affect the loop's ability to execute; it is an independent variable that may be modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the state must be adjusted to ensure that `data` contains at least one element and that `(x, y)` is set to the first element in `data`.
