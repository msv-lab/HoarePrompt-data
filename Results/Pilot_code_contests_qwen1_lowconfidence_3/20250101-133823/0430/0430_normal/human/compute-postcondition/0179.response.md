`cross_points` is a list of all valid points including either `cp1` and `cp2` if they fall within the bounds [0.0, 10.0], or the newly added points \((x1 + \cos(th + al), y1 + \sin(th + al))\) and \((x1 + \cos(th - al), y1 + \sin(th - al))\) if they do not fall within the bounds. The code appends `cp2` to `cross_points`. Since `cp2` is already included in the description of `cross_points`, appending `cp2` to `cross_points` does not change the list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `data` remains a list of tuples, `RADIUS` and `RADIUS_2` remain as \(1 + 1e-12\) and \(2 + 1e-12\) respectively, `num_data` remains a positive integer, `cross_points` is a list of all valid points including either `cp1` and `cp2` if they fall within the bounds [0.0, 10.0], or the newly added points \((x1 + \cos(th + al), y1 + \sin(th + al))\) and \((x1 + \cos(th - al), y1 + \sin(th - al))\) if they do not fall within the bounds, `x2` and `y2` are the first and second elements of the \((j + 1)\)-th tuple in `data` respectively, and `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\). `cross_points` now includes `cp2`.**
