The function `func_1` accepts a single string parameter `s` that contains space-separated integers `ai` (where `1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000`), representing the heights where the holds hang, and the sequence of these integers is strictly increasing. The function processes this string and returns a list of integers derived from `s`. The function ensures that each integer in the returned list corresponds to one of the integers in the input string `s`, without any modifications or additional operations being performed. Potential edge cases include an empty string input, where the function would return an empty list, and the sequence of integers not being strictly increasing, in which case the function still processes the string into integers but the input condition is not met.
