The function `func_2` accepts a single argument `args`, which is a list containing exactly one element—a list of `n` space-separated integers representing the heights of the holds (where `3 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000`). It then calls another function `func_1` with the second element of the list (`args[1]`), converts the result into a tuple, and returns this tuple. The returned tuple contains the same elements as the list found at `args[1]`. There are no specified edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code, assuming `func_1` correctly processes its input and returns a valid list.
