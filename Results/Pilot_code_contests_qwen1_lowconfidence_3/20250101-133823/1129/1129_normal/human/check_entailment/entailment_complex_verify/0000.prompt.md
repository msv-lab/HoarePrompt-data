You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mike is trying rock climbing but he is awful at it. 

There are n holds on the wall, i-th hold is at height ai off the ground. Besides, let the sequence ai increase, that is, ai < ai + 1 for all i from 1 to n - 1; we will call such sequence a track. Mike thinks that the track a1, ..., an has difficulty <image>. In other words, difficulty equals the maximum distance between two holds that are adjacent in height.

Today Mike decided to cover the track with holds hanging on heights a1, ..., an. To make the problem harder, Mike decided to remove one hold, that is, remove one element of the sequence (for example, if we take the sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and remove the third element from it, we obtain the sequence (1, 2, 4, 5)). However, as Mike is awful at climbing, he wants the final difficulty (i.e. the maximum difference of heights between adjacent holds after removing the hold) to be as small as possible among all possible options of removing a hold. The first and last holds must stay at their positions.

Help Mike determine the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of holds.

The next line contains n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000), where ai is the height where the hold number i hangs. The sequence ai is increasing (i.e. each element except for the first one is strictly larger than the previous one).

Output

Print a single number — the minimum difficulty of the track after removing a single hold.

Examples

Input

3
1 4 6


Output

5


Input

5
1 2 3 4 5


Output

2


Input

5
1 2 3 7 8


Output

4

Note

In the first sample you can remove only the second hold, then the sequence looks like (1, 6), the maximum difference of the neighboring elements equals 5.

In the second test after removing every hold the difficulty equals 2.

In the third test you can obtain sequences (1, 3, 7, 8), (1, 2, 7, 8), (1, 2, 3, 8), for which the difficulty is 4, 5 and 5, respectively. Thus, after removing the second element we obtain the optimal answer — 4.
Program:
```
import fileinput
#Function 1:
def func_1(s):
    return [int(x) for x in s.split()]

#Function 2:
def func_2(args):
    a_s = tuple(func_1(args[1]))
    return a_s

#Function 3:
def func_3(args, verbose=False):
    a_s = func_2(args)
    max_1 = -float('inf')
    min_2 = float('inf')
    for k in xrange(len(a_s) - 1):
        max_1 = max(max_1, a_s[k + 1] - a_s[k])
    for k in xrange(len(a_s) - 2):
        min_2 = min(min_2, a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k])
    return max(max_1, min_2)

#Function 4:
def func_4():
    assert func_1('1 2 3') == [1, 2, 3]
    assert func_3(['3', '1 4 6']) == 5
    assert func_3(['5', '1 2 3 4 5']) == 2
    assert func_3(['5', '1 2 3 7 8']) == 4


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The core issue lies in the logic used to calculate the minimum difficulty after removing one hold. Specifically, the code only considers the differences between every second pair of elements, which does not accurately reflect the maximum difference between adjacent holds after removing one hold.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

**Input:**
```
5
1 2 3 7 8
```

The correct approach would involve considering the effect of removing each hold individually and then determining the maximum difference between adjacent holds for each scenario. The current implementation only checks the difference between every second pair of elements, which fails to capture the true minimum difficulty.

For instance, if we remove the second element (2), the sequence becomes [1, 3, 7, 8], and the maximum difference is \(7 - 3 = 4\). However, the current code would incorrectly compute the minimum difference between every second pair, which is also 4 but does not account for the true impact of removing the second element.

Thus, the provided program does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import fileinput

if __name__ == '__main__':
    from sys import argv
    if argv.pop() == 'test':
        func_4()
    else:
        func_3(list(fileinput.input()), verbose=True)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string containing n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000) representing the heights where the holds hang, and the sequence ai is increasing.
def func_1(s):
    return [int(x) for x in s.split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from the string `s` which contains space-separated integers and represents the heights where the holds hang
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single string parameter `s` that contains space-separated integers `ai` (where `1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000`), representing the heights where the holds hang, and the sequence of these integers is strictly increasing. The function processes this string and returns a list of integers derived from `s`. The function ensures that each integer in the returned list corresponds to one of the integers in the input string `s`, without any modifications or additional operations being performed. Potential edge cases include an empty string input, where the function would return an empty list, and the sequence of integers not being strictly increasing, in which case the function still processes the string into integers but the input condition is not met.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a list containing exactly one element, which is a list of n space-separated integers representing the heights of the holds (ai). The list has n elements where 3 ≤ n ≤ 100 and each ai is an integer such that 1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000, and the sequence ai is strictly increasing.
def func_2(args):
    a_s = tuple(func_1(args[1]))
    return a_s
    #The program returns a_s which is a tuple containing the same elements as the list in args[1]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a single argument `args`, which is a list containing exactly one element—a list of `n` space-separated integers representing the heights of the holds (where `3 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000`). It then calls another function `func_1` with the second element of the list (`args[1]`), converts the result into a tuple, and returns this tuple. The returned tuple contains the same elements as the list found at `args[1]`. There are no specified edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code, assuming `func_1` correctly processes its input and returns a valid list.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `a_s` is a list of `n` integers where `n` is at least 3, and the integers are in strictly increasing order.
def func_3(args, verbose):
    a_s = func_2(args)
    max_1 = -float('inf')
    min_2 = float('inf')
    for k in xrange(len(a_s) - 1):
        max_1 = max(max_1, a_s[k + 1] - a_s[k])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a_s` is a list of integers in strictly increasing order, `max_1` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `a_s`, `min_2` is float('inf')
    for k in xrange(len(a_s) - 2):
        min_2 = min(min_2, a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a_s` is a list of integers in strictly increasing order and must have at least 3 elements, `max_1` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `a_s`, `min_2` is the minimum difference between any two non-consecutive elements in `a_s`.
    return max(max_1, min_2)
    #The program returns the larger value between the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements (`max_1`) and the minimum difference between any two non-consecutive elements (`min_2`) in the list `a_s`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `args` and `verbose`. `args` is a list of at least 3 strictly increasing integers, and `verbose` is a boolean value. The function calculates the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements (`max_1`) and the minimum difference between any two non-consecutive elements (`min_2`) in the list `args`. It then returns the larger value between `max_1` and `min_2`.

The function iterates through the list `args` twice to compute these values. The first iteration calculates `max_1`, which is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements. The second iteration calculates `min_2`, which is the minimum difference between any two non-consecutive elements.

Potential edge cases include:
- If the list `args` has exactly 3 elements, both `max_1` and `min_2` calculations will be based on the differences between these three elements.
- If `args` has more than 3 elements, `min_2` will be calculated over all possible pairs of non-consecutive elements.

Missing functionality in the annotations includes:
- The initial state of `a_s` is mentioned as being the same as `args`, but the function does not modify `args`; instead, it uses `a_s` as a temporary variable to store the list for calculation purposes.
- The `verbose` parameter is not used within the function and thus does not affect the output.

Therefore, the function's final state after execution is that it returns the larger value between `max_1` and `min_2`, which represent the maximum and minimum differences as described.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `holds` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and the list is sorted in strictly increasing order.
def func_4():
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `holds` (a list of n integers sorted in strictly increasing order). After executing, the function does not return any value. Since the function does not contain any operations that modify the input parameters or produce any output, the final state of the program remains unchanged. There are no actions performed by the function, and it does not alter the input list `holds` or generate any new data.
