Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated version clarifies that the function `func_3` is not correctly calculating the minimum difficulty after removing one hold. Specifically, the logic only considers the differences between every second pair of elements, which does not accurately reflect the maximum difference between adjacent holds after removing one hold.

The annotated version explains that the function `func_3` calculates `max_1` as the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements and `min_2` as the minimum difference between any two non-consecutive elements. However, this does not account for the true impact of removing each hold individually to find the minimum difficulty. As the problem requires, the function should consider the effect of removing each hold and then determine the maximum difference between adjacent holds for each scenario.

Since the provided code does not implement this necessary logic and only checks the differences between every second pair of elements, it does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, the original assessment of **False** is correct.
