Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_3` does not correctly calculate the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold. According to the problem description, the goal is to find the minimum difficulty by removing one hold, which means the maximum distance between two adjacent holds should be minimized after the removal. However, the current implementation of `func_3` does not consider the effect of removing each hold individually and calculating the resulting difficulty.

Here’s a breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The function `func_3` calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements (`max_1`) and the minimum difference between non-consecutive elements (`min_2`). However, this does not account for the actual removal of a single hold and the subsequent recalculation of the difficulty.

2. **Missing Hold Removal Logic**: The function does not iterate through each possible hold removal and calculate the resulting difficulty. Instead, it directly computes the maximum and minimum differences without considering the removal of a specific hold.

3. **Example to Show Inconsistency**:
   - Consider the input `['5', '1 2 3 4 5']`. The function returns 2, which is the correct minimum difficulty if we remove the hold at index 2 (value 3), making the sequence (1, 2, 4, 5). The maximum difference is 2 (between 2 and 4).
   - However, the function does not perform this specific check and instead calculates the minimum difference between non-consecutive elements, which does not guarantee the correct minimum difficulty after removing a single hold.

To fix this, the function needs to iterate through each possible hold removal, temporarily remove the hold, and then calculate the new difficulty. Here’s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_3(args, verbose=False):
    a_s = func_2(args)
    n = len(a_s)
    min_difficulty = float('inf')
    
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        # Remove the hold at index i
        temp_a_s = a_s[:i] + a_s[i+1:]
        max_diff = max(temp_a_s[k + 1] - temp_a_s[k] for k in range(len(temp_a_s) - 1))
        min_difficulty = min(min_difficulty, max_diff)
    
    return min_difficulty
```

This corrected function iterates through each possible hold removal, recalculates the difficulty, and keeps track of the minimum difficulty found.
