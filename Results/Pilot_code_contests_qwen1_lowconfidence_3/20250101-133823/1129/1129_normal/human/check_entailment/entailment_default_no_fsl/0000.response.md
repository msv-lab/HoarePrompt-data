Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not account for the scenario where the removed hold is either the first or the last hold in the sequence. According to the problem description, the first and last holds must remain in their positions, but `func_3` does not consider the case where the removed hold could be the second or the second-to-last hold, which would affect the calculation of the difficulty.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

Input:
```
5
1 2 3 7 8
```

The correct output should be 4, as explained in the problem description. However, the current implementation of `func_3` does not handle this case correctly and would fail to provide the right difficulty.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_3(args, verbose=False):
    a_s = func_2(args)
    max_diff = -float('inf')
    # Calculate the maximum difference between consecutive elements
    for k in range(1, len(a_s)):
        max_diff = max(max_diff, a_s[k] - a_s[k-1])
    
    # Calculate the maximum difference after removing the second or second-to-last element
    if len(a_s) > 3:
        max_diff = max(max_diff, a_s[2] - a_s[0], a_s[-1] - a_s[-3])
    
    return max_diff

def func_2(args):
    a_s = tuple(func_1(args[1]))
    return a_s

def func_1(s):
    return [int(x) for x in s.split()]

def func_4():
    assert func_1('1 2 3') == [1, 2, 3]
    assert func_3(['3', '1 4 6']) == 5
    assert func_3(['5', '1 2 3 4 5']) == 2
    assert func_3(['5', '1 2 3 7 8']) == 4
```

This corrected version ensures that the maximum difficulty is calculated considering the removal of the second or second-to-last hold, which was previously missing.
