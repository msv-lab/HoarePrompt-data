Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the hold to be removed is either the second or the second-to-last hold in the sequence. Let's consider the following case:

### Case Analysis:
- **Input**: `5`
- **Sequence**: `1 2 3 7 8`

According to the problem description, Mike needs to remove one hold to minimize the difficulty, which is defined as the maximum difference between adjacent holds after removal. The sequence given is `1 2 3 7 8`. 

If we remove the second hold (`2`), the new sequence becomes `1 3 7 8`, and the differences are:
- Between `1` and `3`: `2`
- Between `3` and `7`: `4`
- Between `7` and `8`: `1`

The maximum difference is `4`.

If we remove the third hold (`3`), the new sequence becomes `1 2 7 8`, and the differences are:
- Between `1` and `2`: `1`
- Between `2` and `7`: `5`
- Between `7` and `8`: `1`

The maximum difference is `5`.

If we remove the fourth hold (`7`), the new sequence becomes `1 2 3 8`, and the differences are:
- Between `1` and `2`: `1`
- Between `2` and `3`: `1`
- Between `3` and `8`: `5`

The maximum difference is `5`.

The optimal solution is to remove the second or the fourth hold, resulting in a maximum difference of `4`.

However, the current implementation does not account for this case properly. Specifically, the code does not correctly calculate the differences when the hold to be removed is the second or the second-to-last hold. The provided function `func_3` calculates the maximum difference but does not consider the special cases where the hold to be removed is the second or the second-to-last hold.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, and hence the correctness is **False**.
