Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_4` does not perform any operations that would address the problem requirements. It merely contains assertions without actually implementing the solution to find the minimum difficulty after removing one hold. The output hints confirm that `func_4` does not return any value and does not modify the input parameters. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and cannot be considered correct.
