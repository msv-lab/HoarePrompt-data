Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not correctly handle the scenario where the hold to be removed is either the second or the second-to-last hold in the sequence. The function `func_3` does not consider these edge cases properly, leading to incorrect results in certain situations. For instance, in the input sequence `1 2 3 7 8`, the function fails to identify that removing the second or fourth hold yields the minimum difficulty of `4`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
