Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not consider the removal of each hold individually to determine the minimum difficulty. Instead, it calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements and the minimum difference between non-consecutive elements without removing any elements. This approach does not account for the scenario where removing a particular hold could reduce the maximum difference between adjacent holds more effectively.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
5
1 2 3 7 8
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

According to the problem description, we need to find the minimum difficulty after removing one hold. Let's analyze the possible outcomes by removing each hold:

1. Remove the first hold (1): The sequence becomes [2, 3, 7, 8]. The maximum difference is \(8 - 2 = 6\).
2. Remove the second hold (2): The sequence becomes [1, 3, 7, 8]. The maximum difference is \(8 - 1 = 7\).
3. Remove the third hold (3): The sequence becomes [1, 2, 7, 8]. The maximum difference is \(8 - 1 = 7\).
4. Remove the fourth hold (7): The sequence becomes [1, 2, 3, 8]. The maximum difference is \(8 - 1 = 7\).
5. Remove the fifth hold (8): The sequence becomes [1, 2, 3, 7]. The maximum difference is \(7 - 1 = 6\).

The minimum difficulty after removing any hold is 4, which occurs when the third hold (3) is removed. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario and returns 7 instead.

Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the code is incorrect.
