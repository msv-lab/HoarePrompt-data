Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the problem requires finding the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold, which means the goal is to minimize the maximum difference between adjacent holds after the removal. However, the current implementation does not achieve this.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**:
   - The current implementation in `func_3` calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements (`max_1`) and the minimum difference between non-consecutive elements (`min_2`). It then returns the larger of these two values.
   - This does not address the requirement to find the minimum possible difficulty after removing one hold. Instead, it calculates some intermediate values without considering the effect of removing a specific hold.

2. **Lack of Hold Removal**:
   - The program does not simulate the removal of any specific hold. It simply computes the maximum and minimum differences without considering the impact of removing any particular hold on the overall difficulty.

3. **Logic to Minimize Difficulty**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, you need to consider the effect of removing each possible hold (except the first and last ones, as specified). For each hold removal, compute the new maximum difference between adjacent holds and keep track of the minimum such maximum difference across all possible removals.

### Correct Approach:

Here is a corrected version of the program that properly implements the logic:

```python
def func_3(args, verbose):
    a_s = func_2(args)
    min_difficulty = float('inf')
    
    for i in range(1, len(a_s) - 1):
        # Remove the i-th hold
        temp_a_s = a_s[:i] + a_s[i+1:]
        max_diff = max(temp_a_s[j+1] - temp_a_s[j] for j in range(len(temp_a_s) - 1))
        min_difficulty = min(min_difficulty, max_diff)
        
    return min_difficulty

def func_2(args):
    a_s = tuple(func_1(args[1]))
    return a_s

def func_1(s):
    return [int(x) for x in s.split()]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    from sys import argv
    if argv.pop() == 'test':
        func_4()
    else:
        func_3(list(fileinput.input()), verbose=True)

def func_4():
    pass
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:

- **func_1**: Converts the input string into a list of integers.
- **func_2**: Converts the list of integers into a tuple (though this step is not necessary).
- **func_3**: Iterates over each possible hold to remove (excluding the first and last holds). For each removal, it computes the new maximum difference between adjacent holds and updates the minimum difficulty found.

This approach ensures that the program correctly finds the minimum difficulty after removing one hold, aligning with the problem description.
