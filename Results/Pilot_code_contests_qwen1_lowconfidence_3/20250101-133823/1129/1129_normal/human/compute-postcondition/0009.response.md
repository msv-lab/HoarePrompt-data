Output State: **`a_s` is a list of integers in strictly increasing order, `max_1` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `a_s`, `min_2` is float('inf')**.

### Explanation:
- **`a_s`**: The list remains in strictly increasing order throughout the loop because the loop only updates `max_1` based on the differences between consecutive elements, assuming `a_s` is sorted in increasing order initially.
- **`max_1`**: After all iterations of the loop, `max_1` will hold the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `a_s`. This is because the loop iteratively compares each pair of consecutive elements and updates `max_1` if a larger difference is found.
- **`min_2`**: Since `min_2` is initialized to `float('inf')` and never updated within the loop, its value remains `float('inf')` after the loop completes.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, `a_s` will still be a list of integers in strictly increasing order, `max_1` will be the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `a_s`, and `min_2` will remain `float('inf')`.
