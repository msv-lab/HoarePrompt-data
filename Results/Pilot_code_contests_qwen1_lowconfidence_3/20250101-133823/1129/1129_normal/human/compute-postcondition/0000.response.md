The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a parameter `holds`, which is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and the list is sorted in strictly increasing order. The function does not return any value based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `holds` (a list of n integers sorted in strictly increasing order), and does not return any value.**
