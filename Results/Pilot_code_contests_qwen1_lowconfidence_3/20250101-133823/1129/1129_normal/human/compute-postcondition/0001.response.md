Functionality: **The function `func_4` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `holds` (a list of n integers sorted in strictly increasing order). After executing, the function does not return any value. Since the function does not contain any operations that modify the input parameters or produce any output, the final state of the program remains unchanged. There are no actions performed by the function, and it does not alter the input list `holds` or generate any new data.**

Given the annotations and the code provided, it appears that the function might be intended to perform some operation on the input parameters, but the actual code does not contain any such operations. Therefore, the function simply returns without making any changes to its inputs.
