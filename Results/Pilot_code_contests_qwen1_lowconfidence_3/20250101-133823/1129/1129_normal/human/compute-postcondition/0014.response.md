According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `len(a_s) - 3`, because it accesses elements `k`, `k+1`, and `k+2` in the list `a_s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is incremented by 1 (if the loop executed), so we need to determine the new value of `k`.

Given:
- `a_s` is a list of integers in strictly increasing order and must have at least 3 elements.
- `max_1` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `a_s`.
- `min_2` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the difference between the element at index `k + 2` and the element at index `k` in `a_s`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `a_s` is a list of integers in strictly increasing order and must have at least 3 elements.
- `max_1` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- `min_2` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the difference between the element at index `k + 2` and the element at index `k` in `a_s`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `k` must be incremented by 1, so the new value of `k` will be `k + 1`.
- The condition `k < len(a_s) - 2` must still hold true.

Let's denote the previous value of `k` as `k_prev`. Then the new value of `k` will be `k_prev + 1`. Since the loop was able to execute previously, `k_prev < len(a_s) - 2` must hold. Therefore, `k + 1 < len(a_s) - 2` must hold for the next iteration.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a_s` is a list of integers in strictly increasing order and must have at least 3 elements, `max_1` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `a_s`, `min_2` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the difference between the element at index `k + 1 + 2` (which is `k + 3`) and the element at index `k + 1` in `a_s`, and `k` is incremented by 1**.

To summarize:
State: **`a_s` is a list of integers in strictly increasing order and must have at least 3 elements, `max_1` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `a_s`, `min_2` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the difference between the element at index `k + 3` and the element at index `k + 1` in `a_s`, and `k` is `k + 1`**.
