Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `k` in `range(len(a_s) - 1)`. This means `k` will iterate over all possible indices from 0 to `len(a_s) - 2`.

2. **Current States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `a_s` is a list of integers in strictly increasing order.
   - `max_1` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `a_s`.
   - `min_2` is currently set to `float('inf')`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `k` is iterating over the range `len(a_s) - 1`, the loop will continue as long as `k` is less than `len(a_s) - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `k` would have been `len(a_s) - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, so `k` becomes `len(a_s) - 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `a_s` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `max_1` remains the same because the loop body is omitted and we don't have information about how `max_1` is updated.
   - `min_2` remains `float('inf')` unless the loop body updates it, but since it is omitted, it stays the same.

5. **Final State for the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - The value of `k` changes to `len(a_s) - 1`.
   - All other states (`a_s`, `max_1`, `min_2`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`a_s` is a list of integers in strictly increasing order, `max_1` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `a_s`, `min_2` is float('inf'), `k` is len(a_s) - 1**
