Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a_s` is a list of integers in strictly increasing order.
- `max_1` is the maximum of its original value and the difference between the last two elements in `a_s`.
- `min_2` is `float('inf')`.
- `k` is `len(a_s) - 1`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for k in xrange(len(a_s) - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Key Points:
- The loop iterates from `0` to `len(a_s) - 2` (since `k` starts at `0` and goes up to `len(a_s) - 2`).
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `k < len(a_s) - 1`.

### Current Value of `k`:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is `len(a_s) - 1`.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than `len(a_s) - 1`.
- Since `k` is currently `len(a_s) - 1`, it cannot satisfy the condition `k < len(a_s) - 1`.

### Adjusted States:
- The only state that needs to change for the loop to execute again is `k`. Specifically, `k` should be set to `len(a_s) - 2` to enter the next iteration.

### Final State:
- `a_s` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications to `a_s` are mentioned.
- `max_1` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications to `max_1` are mentioned.
- `min_2` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications to `min_2` are mentioned.
- `k` changes from `len(a_s) - 1` to `len(a_s) - 2`.

### Answer:
State: **`a_s` is a list of integers in strictly increasing order, `max_1` is the maximum of its original value and the difference between the last two elements in `a_s`, `min_2` is float('inf'), `k` is len(a_s) - 2**
