The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `args` and `verbose`. 

- `args` is a list of `n` integers where `n` is at least 3, and the integers are in strictly increasing order.
- `verbose` is a boolean value.

The function calculates the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements (`max_1`) and the minimum difference between any two non-consecutive elements (`min_2`) in the list `args`. It then returns the larger value between `max_1` and `min_2`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a list `args` of at least 3 strictly increasing integers and a boolean `verbose`, and return the larger value between the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements and the minimum difference between any two non-consecutive elements in the list.
