Let's break down the given for loop and identify the necessary states to ensure the loop can execute.

The for loop statement is:
```python
for k in xrange(len(a_s) - 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `k`**: The variable `k` takes values from `0` to `len(a_s) - 3` (inclusive). This means the loop will iterate as long as `k` is less than `len(a_s) - 2`.

2. **Variable `a_s`**: The list `a_s` is a list of integers in strictly increasing order. For the loop to execute, `a_s` must contain at least 3 elements because the loop runs up to `len(a_s) - 3`.

3. **Variables `max_1` and `min_2`**: These variables are not directly related to the loop condition but may be updated inside the loop. However, they do not affect the loop's ability to execute based on the given condition.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, the list `a_s` must contain at least 3 elements. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `len(a_s)` is at least 3.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a_s` is a list of integers in strictly increasing order and must have at least 3 elements, max_1 is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `a_s`, min_2 is float('inf')**
