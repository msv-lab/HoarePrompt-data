Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `args` and `verbose`. `args` is a list of at least 3 strictly increasing integers, and `verbose` is a boolean value. The function calculates the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements (`max_1`) and the minimum difference between any two non-consecutive elements (`min_2`) in the list `args`. It then returns the larger value between `max_1` and `min_2`.

The function iterates through the list `args` twice to compute these values. The first iteration calculates `max_1`, which is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements. The second iteration calculates `min_2`, which is the minimum difference between any two non-consecutive elements.

Potential edge cases include:
- If the list `args` has exactly 3 elements, both `max_1` and `min_2` calculations will be based on the differences between these three elements.
- If `args` has more than 3 elements, `min_2` will be calculated over all possible pairs of non-consecutive elements.

Missing functionality in the annotations includes:
- The initial state of `a_s` is mentioned as being the same as `args`, but the function does not modify `args`; instead, it uses `a_s` as a temporary variable to store the list for calculation purposes.
- The `verbose` parameter is not used within the function and thus does not affect the output.

Therefore, the function's final state after execution is that it returns the larger value between `max_1` and `min_2`, which represent the maximum and minimum differences as described.**
