Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a_s` is a list of integers in strictly increasing order and must have at least 3 elements.
   - `max_1` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `a_s`.
   - `min_2` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the difference between the element at index `k + 2` and the element at index `k` in `a_s`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `k` from `0` to `len(a_s) - 3` (since `a_s` has at least 3 elements, the last two elements cannot be part of a difference calculation).

3. **What Changes in Each Iteration:**
   - For each `k`, the loop calculates the difference between `a_s[k + 2]` and `a_s[k]`.
   - `min_2` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and this difference.

4. **State After the Previous Iteration:**
   - Let's assume `k` was `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, `a_s` remains the same.
   - `max_1` remains the same.
   - `min_2` is updated to include the difference between `a_s[i + 2]` and `a_s[i]`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - The next `k` value will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, `a_s` remains the same.
   - `max_1` remains the same.
   - `min_2` will now be updated to include the difference between `a_s[i + 3]` and `a_s[i + 1]`.

6. **State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `a_s` remains a list of integers in strictly increasing order and still has at least 3 elements.
   - `max_1` remains the same.
   - `min_2` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the difference between `a_s[i + 3]` and `a_s[i + 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`a_s` is a list of integers in strictly increasing order and must have at least 3 elements, `max_1` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `a_s`, `min_2` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the difference between the element at index `k + 3` and the element at index `k + 1` in `a_s`**.
