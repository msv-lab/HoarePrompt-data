The code assigns `float('inf')` to the variable `min_2`. This does not affect the values of `a_s` or `max_1`. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`a_s` is the result of calling `func_2(args)`, which replaces the initial list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order; `max_1` is `-float('inf')`; `min_2` is `float('inf')`.**
