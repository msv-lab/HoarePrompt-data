The code updates `max_1` to be the maximum value between its current value (`-float('inf')`) and the difference between `a_s[k + 1]` and `a_s[k]`. Since `a_s` is a list of integers in strictly increasing order, the difference `a_s[k + 1] - a_s[k]` is always a positive integer. Therefore, `max_1` will be updated to this positive integer.

The states of the other variables (`a_s`, `max_1`, `k`, and `min_2`) are not directly affected by the code except for `max_1`.

Output State: **`a_s` is a list of integers in strictly increasing order, `max_1` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `a_s`, `min_2` is float('inf')**
