The code updates `min_2` to be the minimum of its current value and the difference between the element at index `k+2` and the element at index `k` in the list `a_s`. Since `a_s` is a list of integers in strictly increasing order, the difference `a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k]` is guaranteed to be positive and the smallest such difference will be used to update `min_2`.

However, the specific values of `a_s` and `k` are not provided, so we can only express the update in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`a_s` is a list of integers in strictly increasing order and must have at least 3 elements, max_1 is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `a_s`, `min_2` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the difference between the element at index `k + 2` and the element at index `k` in `a_s`.**
