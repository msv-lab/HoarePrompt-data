Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the steps and verify each part:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads two integers, `K` and `S`, from standard input using `raw_input().split()`.
   - These inputs are validated by the constraints given: \(2 \leq K \leq 2500\) and \(0 \leq S \leq 3K\).

2. **Initialization:**
   - Variables `patterns` and `ct` are initialized. `patterns` is not used, so it is ignored.
   - `ct` is used to count the number of valid triples \((X, Y, Z)\) that satisfy the equation \(X + Y + Z = S\).

3. **Nested Loops:**
   - Two nested loops iterate over possible values of `X` and `Y` within the range \([0, K]\).
   - For each pair \((X, Y)\), the remaining value `Z` is calculated as `nokori = s - x - y`.
   - The condition `0 <= nokori - y <= k` ensures that the value of `Z` is within the allowed range \([0, K]\).

4. **Counting Valid Triples:**
   - If the condition `0 <= nokori - y <= k` is satisfied, `ct` is incremented, counting the valid triple \((X, Y, Z)\).

5. **Output:**
   - After the loops complete, the program prints the value of `ct`, which represents the number of valid triples.

Given the above steps, the program accurately counts the number of valid triples \((X, Y, Z)\) such that \(0 \leq X, Y, Z \leq K\) and \(X + Y + Z = S\). The program follows the constraints and logic described in the problem statement without any deviations. Therefore, the program is correct.
