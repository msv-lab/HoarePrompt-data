The function `func` accepts two parameters: `K` and `S`. `K` is an integer such that \(2 \leq K \leq 2500\), and `S` is an integer such that \(0 \leq S \leq 3K\). After executing the function, it counts the number of valid pairs \((x, y)\) where both \(x\) and \(y\) are in the range \([0, k]\) and satisfy \(0 \leq s - x - y \leq k\). If the input values of `K` and `S` are within their specified ranges, the function prints the count of these valid pairs. Otherwise, the function does not return any specific value and the behavior is undefined since no error handling is implemented.
