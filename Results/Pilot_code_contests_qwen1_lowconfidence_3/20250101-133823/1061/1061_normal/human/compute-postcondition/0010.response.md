`ct` is incremented by 1. The values of `k`, `nokori`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 2500\), `nokori` is \(s - x\), `y` is 1, and `ct` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 2500\), `nokori` is \(s - x\), `y` is 1, and `ct` is increased by 1**
