The code initializes an empty list named `patterns`. This does not affect the values of `k` and `s`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `k` being an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2500, `s` being an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 3k, and `patterns` being an empty list.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2500; `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 3k; `patterns` is an empty list**
