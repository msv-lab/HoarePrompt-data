The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `k` and `s`. Given the initial conditions, `k` is an integer between 2 and 2500, and `s` is an integer between 0 and 3 times the value of `k`. After executing this line of code, the values of `k` and `s` will be updated to the integers read from input, but their specific values remain unspecified.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2500, `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 3k, `k` and `s` have been updated to the integers read from input**
