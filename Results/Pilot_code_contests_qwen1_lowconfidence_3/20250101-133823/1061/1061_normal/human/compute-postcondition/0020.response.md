`ct` is incremented by 1. The values of `k`, `nokori`, `y`, and the condition for `ct` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 2500\), `nokori` is \(s - x\), `y` is \(k\), `ct` is the count of integers \(y\) in the range \([0, k]\) such that \(0 \leq nokori - y \leq k\) plus 1.
