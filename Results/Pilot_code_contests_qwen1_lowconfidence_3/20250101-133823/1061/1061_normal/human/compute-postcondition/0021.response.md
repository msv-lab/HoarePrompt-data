Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 2500\), `nokori` is \(s - x\), `y` is \(k\), and `ct` is the count of integers \(y\) in the range \([0, k]\) such that \(0 \leq nokori - y \leq k\) plus 1. This means that if the condition \(0 \leq nokori - y \leq k\) holds true, `ct` is incremented by 1. If the condition does not hold, `ct` remains unchanged.***
