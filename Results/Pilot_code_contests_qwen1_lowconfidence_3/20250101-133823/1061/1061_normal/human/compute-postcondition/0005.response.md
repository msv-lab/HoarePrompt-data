State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2500, `nokori` is `s - x`, `y` is 0**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Identify the Loop Variable**: The loop variable in the given `for` loop is `y`.
2. **Determine Initial Value of Loop Variable**: The loop starts from `0` and goes up to `k + 1`. Therefore, at the beginning of the loop, `y` should be set to `0`.
3. **Check Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as `y` is less than or equal to `k`. Since the loop starts at `0`, the condition `y <= k` is satisfied at the start if `k` is valid (which is given as an integer between 2 and 2500).

Given these points, we need to ensure the following states:
- `k` is within the specified range (2 ≤ k ≤ 2500).
- `nokori` is defined as `s - x`.
- `y` is initially set to `0`.

Thus, the final state required for the loop to execute is:
State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2500, `nokori` is `s - x`, `y` is 0**
