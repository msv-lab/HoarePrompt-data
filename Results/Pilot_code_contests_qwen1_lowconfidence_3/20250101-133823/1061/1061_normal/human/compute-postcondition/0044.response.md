The function `func` accepts two parameters: `K` and `S`. `K` is an integer such that 2 ≤ K ≤ 2500, and `S` is an integer such that 0 ≤ S ≤ 3K. 

Case_1: `K` is an integer in the range [2, 2500] and `S` is an integer in the range [0, 3K]. If `S` is within the valid range, the function returns `S`. 
Case_2: If `K` is not in the range [2, 2500] or `S` is not in the range [0, 3K], the function returns an error message.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integers `K` and `S` where `K` is between 2 and 2500 inclusive and `S` is between 0 and 3K inclusive, and if `S` is within the valid range, it returns `S`; otherwise, it returns an error message.
