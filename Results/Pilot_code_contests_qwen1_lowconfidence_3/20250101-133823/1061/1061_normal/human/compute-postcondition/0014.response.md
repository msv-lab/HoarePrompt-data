Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 2500\), `nokori` is \(s - x\), `y` is 2, and `ct` is increased by 1 if \(0 \leq nokori - y \leq k\). Since there is no else part, the postcondition only includes the condition where \(0 \leq nokori - y \leq k\) and the corresponding effect on `ct`.***
