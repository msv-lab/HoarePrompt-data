`ct` is incremented by 1. The values of `k`, `nokori`, and `y` remain unchanged. The current value of `nokori - y` is still within the range 0 to k inclusive. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2500, `nokori` is `s - x`, `y` is 0, `ct` is `ct + 1`, and the current value of `nokori - y` is within the range 0 to k inclusive.
Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2500, `nokori` is `s - x`, `y` is 0, `ct` is `ct + 1`, and the current value of `nokori - y` is within the range 0 to k inclusive.**
