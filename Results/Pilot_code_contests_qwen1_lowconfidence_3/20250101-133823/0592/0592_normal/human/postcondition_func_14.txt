The function `func_15` accepts three parameters: `x` and `y` (both non-negative integers) and `p` (a positive integer). It calculates the result `res` using modular exponentiation. Specifically, it computes `res` as \((x^y) \mod p\), where the computation is done efficiently using the method of exponentiation by squaring. After the loop, the function returns `res`, which is the result of the modular exponentiation operation. The function handles edge cases such as when `y` is 0, in which case the result is 1 since \(x^0 = 1\). If `y` is negative or `p` is not a positive integer, these conditions are not explicitly handled within the function, and such inputs would need to be validated before calling the function.
