The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and returns the input provided by the user. The function does not utilize the variables `n` and `m` mentioned in the input, as these variables are not referenced within the function. After the function executes, the program will have received input from the user and will return that input. No further processing of `n` and `m` is performed.
