The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the `file`. Since `at_start` is `False`, `sep` has not been written to the file yet. The state of `file`, `at_start`, and `args` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is either `' '` or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and the content of `file` includes the string representation of `x`.

Output State: **`sep` is either `' '` or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and the content of `file` includes the string representation of `x`**
