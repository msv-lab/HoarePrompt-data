`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to `file`. The value of `sep` can be either `' '` or a value from `kwargs`. The value of `at_start` remains `True`, and `args` remains a non-empty iterable. After executing this line, `sep` is written to `file`.

Output State: **`sep` is written to `file`, `at_start` is `True`, `args` is a non-empty iterable**
