The code `file.flush()` flushes the file stream. This means that any buffered data in the `file` is written out to the underlying device. Given that the initial state of `file` contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, and `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, the only thing that changes is that the data in `file` is now flushed. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sep` is either `' '` or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is the same as before but with the data flushed, `at_start` is `False`, the value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`**
