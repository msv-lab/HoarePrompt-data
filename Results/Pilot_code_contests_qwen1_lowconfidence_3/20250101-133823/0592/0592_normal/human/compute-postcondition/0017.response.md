The code writes the string representation of `x` to the file. Since the initial state indicates that `file` contains the string representation of the next element in `args` followed by `sep`, and the if condition (`not at_start`) is met, the `else` part does not execute, meaning the content of `file` will now include the string representation of `x` followed by `sep`.

The variable `at_start` remains `False` because the code does not change its value. The variable `sep` is unchanged as it was written to `file` in the previous step and is not involved in the current operation. The variable `args` is also unchanged as it is a non-empty iterable and is not modified.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `sep` is written to `file`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `file` contains the string representation of the next element in `args` followed by `sep` and then the string representation of `x` followed by `sep`.**
