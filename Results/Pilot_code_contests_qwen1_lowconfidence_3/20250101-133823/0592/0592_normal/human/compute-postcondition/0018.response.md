`at_start` is set to `False`, which was its initial value. The values of `sep`, `args`, and `file` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `sep` is written to `file`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `file` contains the string representation of the next element in `args` followed by `sep` and then the string representation of `x` followed by `sep`.**
