According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop will execute if `args` is a non-empty iterable. 

Before the loop starts, the given states are:
- `sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`.
- `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`.
- `at_start` is `True`.

The key state to adjust is ensuring that `args` is a non-empty iterable because that's what the loop will iterate over. Since no specific initial value for `args` is given, we need to ensure that `args` contains at least one element.

Hereâ€™s the adjusted state:

State: **`sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, `at_start` is `True`, `args` is a non-empty iterable**
