You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1.
def func_17(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 3 does not hold
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer, and it is not divisible by 2 or 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'n' is at least 25 and not divisible by 2 or 3, 'i' is an integer such that its final value satisfies \((i + 30) * (i + 30) > n\), and the function returns True if no divisor of the form \(i\), \(i+2\), \(i+6\), or \(i+8\) is found within the range of \(\sqrt{n}\).
    return True
    #The program returns True if no divisor of the form i, i+2, i+6, or i+8 is found within the range of √n, where n is at least 25 and not divisible by 2 or 3, and the final value of i satisfies (i + 30) * (i + 30) > n
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_17` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer greater than 1. The function has multiple return cases based on certain conditions:
#- Case_1: The function returns `False`.
#- Case_2: The function returns `True`.
#- Case_3: The function returns `False`.
#- Case_4: The function returns `False`.
#- Case_5: The function returns `False`.
#- Case_6: The function returns `False`.
#- Case_7: The function returns `True` if no divisor of the form \( i \), \( i+2 \), \( i+6 \), or \( i+8 \) is found within the range of \( \sqrt{n} \), where \( n \) is at least 25 and not divisible by 2 or 3, and the final value of \( i \) satisfies \( (i + 30) \times (i + 30) > n \).
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_17` is to accept an integer `n` greater than 1 and return `False` in most cases, except when specific conditions related to divisors and the square root of `n` are met, in which case it returns `True`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns False

Case_2: The program returns True

Case_3: The program returns False

Case_4: The program returns False

Case_5: The program returns False

Case_6: The program returns False

Case_7: The program returns True if no divisor of the form i, i+2, i+6, or i+8 is found within the range of √n, where n is at least 25 and not divisible by 2 or 3, and the final value of i satisfies (i + 30) * (i + 30) > n


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
