`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file object `file`. Since `sep` can be either `' '` or a value from `kwargs`, and `file` can be either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, the value of `sep` is written to the file. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is either `' '` or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and the value of `sep` has been written to the file.

Output State: **`sep` is either `' '` or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and the value of `sep` has been written to the file.**
