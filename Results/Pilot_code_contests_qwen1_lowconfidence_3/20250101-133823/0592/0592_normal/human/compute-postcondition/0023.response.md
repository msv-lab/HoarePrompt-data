Postcondition: ***`sep` is either `' '` or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is the same as before but with the data flushed, `at_start` is `False`, and the value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`.*** 

Since there is no else part, the postcondition of the if part directly applies to the entire if-else block. Therefore, the postcondition remains unchanged and includes the fact that `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` must have been `True` for the code to execute the if part.
