`at_start` is assigned the value `False`, which was its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is either `' '` or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and the content of `file` includes the string representation of `x`.
