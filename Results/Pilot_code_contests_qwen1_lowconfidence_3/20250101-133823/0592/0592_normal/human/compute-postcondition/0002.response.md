`at_start` is assigned the value `True`. The variables `sep` and `file` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, and `at_start` is `True`.

Output State: **`sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, `at_start` is `True`**
