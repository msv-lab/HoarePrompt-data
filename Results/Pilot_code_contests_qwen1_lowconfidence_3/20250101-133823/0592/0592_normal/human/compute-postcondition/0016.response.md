Postcondition: ***`at_start` is `False`, `sep` is written to `file`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `file` contains the string representation of the next element in `args` followed by `sep`. Since the if condition is met (`not at_start`), the `else` part does not execute, so the postcondition remains as stated in the if part.***
