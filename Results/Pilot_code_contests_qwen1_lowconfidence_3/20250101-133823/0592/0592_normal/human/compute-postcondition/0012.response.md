`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. This operation affects the content of `file` but does not change the state of `sep`, `at_start`, or `args`. Since the initial state of `at_start` being `True` means that `sep` remains unchanged, `sep` stays the same. The values of `at_start` and `args` remain unchanged as well.

Output State: **`sep` is written to `file` or remains unchanged, `at_start` is `True`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `file` contains the string representation of `x` appended to its current content.**
