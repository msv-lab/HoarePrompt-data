Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `sep` is either `' '` or a value from `kwargs`.
   - `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`.
   - `at_start` is `False`.
   - `args` is a non-empty iterable.
   - The content of `file` includes the string representation of `x`.

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for x in args:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `args`.
   - After the first iteration, `at_start` is set to `False` because the first element has already been processed.
   - For the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in `args`.
   - The `file` content will include the string representation of the current `x`.

4. **Updating the States**:
   - `sep` remains unchanged as it is determined before the loop starts and does not change within the loop.
   - `file` remains unchanged as it is determined before the loop starts and does not change within the loop.
   - `at_start` is now `True` because we are starting a new iteration.
   - `args` loses its first element since one element has been processed.

5. **New State**:
   - `args` is now a non-empty iterable (since it was non-empty initially and lost one element).
   - `at_start` is `True` because this is the start of a new iteration.

6. **Final State**:
   - `sep` is either `' '` or a value from `kwargs`.
   - `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`.
   - `at_start` is `True`.
   - `args` is a non-empty iterable (with one less element).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`sep` is either `' '` or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, `at_start` is `True`, `args` is a non-empty iterable**.
