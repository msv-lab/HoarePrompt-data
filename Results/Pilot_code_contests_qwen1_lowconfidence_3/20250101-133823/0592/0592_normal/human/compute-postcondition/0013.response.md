`at_start` is assigned the value `False`, which means it is no longer `True`. The values of `sep`, `args`, and the content of `file` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is `False`, `sep` is written to `file` or remains unchanged, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `file` contains the string representation of `x` appended to its current content.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `sep` is written to `file` or remains unchanged, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `file` contains the string representation of `x` appended to its current content.**
