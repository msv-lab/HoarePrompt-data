Output State: **`sep` is either `' '` or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False`, and `file` contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`.** 

### Explanation:
- **`sep`**: This variable is used to separate the elements in `args`. It remains either `' '` (a space) or a value passed via `kwargs`.
- **`file`**: This variable determines where the output is written. It starts as `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs` and remains unchanged unless modified within the loop. After the loop, `file` will contain the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by `sep`.
- **`at_start`**: Initially set to `True`, it changes to `False` after the first iteration. Since the loop sets `at_start` to `False` in every iteration except the first, by the end of the loop, `at_start` is guaranteed to be `False`.

Given these points, after all iterations of the loop, `file` will contain the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args`, each separated by `sep`.
