Functionality: **The function `func_17` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and determines whether `n` is a prime number. It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 3 and even, or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. For larger numbers, it checks divisibility by potential divisors of the form `i`, `i+2`, `i+6`, and `i+8` up to the square root of `n`. If no such divisor is found and `n` is at least 25, the function returns `True`.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 2 or 3 by returning `True`.
- It correctly identifies even numbers greater than 3 and those divisible by 2 or 3 as non-prime and returns `False`.
- For numbers greater than 3 that are not divisible by 2 or 3, the function uses a loop to check for potential divisors up to the square root of `n`.
- The function assumes that if no divisor is found and `n` is at least 25, it is a prime number. This assumption holds true for the given logic, but it might be beneficial to explicitly state that the function considers numbers greater than 30 and not divisible by 2 or 3 as prime if no divisors are found.

In summary, the function checks for specific conditions to determine if a number is prime, handling both small and large numbers appropriately.
