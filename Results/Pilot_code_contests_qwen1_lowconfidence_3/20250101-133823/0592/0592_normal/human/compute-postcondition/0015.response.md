The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. Before writing, the file contains the string representation of the next element in `args` appended to its current content. After writing, the file will contain the string representation of the next element in `args` followed by `sep`.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `sep` is written to `file`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `file` contains the string representation of the next element in `args` followed by `sep`**
