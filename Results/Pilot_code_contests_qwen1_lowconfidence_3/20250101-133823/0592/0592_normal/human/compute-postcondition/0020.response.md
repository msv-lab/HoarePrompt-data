The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` impacts the program by writing the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to `file`. The value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` is the value associated with the key 'end' in `kwargs`, or '\n' if 'end' is not in `kwargs`. The `at_start` variable is not affected, and neither is the content of `file` before this operation. After the operation, the content of `file` will include the result of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`.

Given the initial state:
- `sep` is either `' '` or a value from `kwargs`
- `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, and it contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`
- `at_start` is `False`

The updated values after the code execution are:
- `at_start` remains `False`
- `file` now includes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` at the end of its current content

Output State: **`sep` is either `' '` or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs` and it now contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, `at_start` is `False`**
