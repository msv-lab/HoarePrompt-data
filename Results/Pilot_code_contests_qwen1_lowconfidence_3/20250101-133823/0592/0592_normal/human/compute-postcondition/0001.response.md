The code `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` is popping values from the `kwargs` dictionary for `sep` and `file`. If `sep` is not provided in `kwargs`, it defaults to a space (' '). If `file` is not provided in `kwargs`, it defaults to `sys.stdout`. However, since the initial state does not provide any specific values for `kwargs`, we cannot determine the exact values of `sep` and `file` without additional context.

Therefore, the output state will show that `sep` and `file` have been assigned values from `kwargs` or their default values, but without knowing the initial values of `kwargs`, we can only state that `sep` is set to `' '` (a space) if not specified, and `file` is set to `sys.stdout` if not specified.

Output State: **`sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`**
