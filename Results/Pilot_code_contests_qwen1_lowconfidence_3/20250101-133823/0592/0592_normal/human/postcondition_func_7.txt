The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` of integers, where each integer represents the height of a tower constructed by students using either two-block or three-block pieces. It returns a new list containing the same integers from `l`, sorted in descending order based on their height. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function correctly sorts the list as specified. The `getKey` function, used as the sorting key, is assumed to be defined elsewhere and extracts the height information from the integers in `l`.
