This function sets the recursion limit and stack size for a threading operation. It then starts a new thread targeting the `main` function. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. After executing, the program will have initiated a new thread that will run the `main` function. The state of the program after the function concludes is that a new thread is active, ready to execute the `main` function, while the original thread continues its execution. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the threading operation fails due to system constraints or where the `main` function itself encounters issues.
