This function accepts no parameters and redirects the standard input stream to a file named 'input.txt' and the standard output stream to a file named 'output.txt'. After the function concludes, all input operations will read from 'input.txt' and all output operations will write to 'output.txt'. This redirection is performed unconditionally and no checks are made for the existence or accessibility of these files. Therefore, if 'input.txt' or 'output.txt' do not exist or are not accessible, the standard streams will be left unchanged.
