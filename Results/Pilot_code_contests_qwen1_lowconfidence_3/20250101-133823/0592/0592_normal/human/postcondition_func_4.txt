The function `func_5()` accepts no parameters and returns a list generated by `func_3()`. Given the condition \( n + m > 0 \), where \( n \) and \( m \) represent the counts of students using two-block and three-block pieces respectively (both non-negative integers), the function ensures that these values meet the requirement. After executing, the program returns a list produced by `func_3()`, without altering the initial inputs \( n \) and \( m \). Potential edge cases include scenarios where \( n \) or \( m \) are zero, as long as their sum is greater than zero. If either \( n \) or \( m \) were negative, the function would not execute as intended due to the stated constraints.
