The function `func_16` accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. Specifically, it repeatedly replaces `x` with `y` and `y` with `x % y` until `y` becomes zero. At this point, `x` contains the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function then returns `x`. 

Potential edge cases include when either `x` or `y` is zero. In such cases, the function directly returns the non-zero value since the GCD of any number and zero is the number itself.
