The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` within the range of 1 to 1,000,000 and returns its binary representation as a string without the '0b' prefix. The function directly converts the integer `n` to its binary form using the built-in `bin()` function and then removes the '0b' prefix using the `replace()` method. This function handles all integers within the specified range correctly and does not require any additional error handling or edge case management since the input range is well-defined and the operations performed are straightforward.
