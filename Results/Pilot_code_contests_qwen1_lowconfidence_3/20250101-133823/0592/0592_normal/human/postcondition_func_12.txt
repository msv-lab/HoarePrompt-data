The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r` (with the constraint 0 ≤ r ≤ n) and returns the result of the combination formula \( \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \). The function calculates the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose `r` elements from a set of `n` elements without regard to the order of selection. The function does not handle cases where `n` or `r` are negative, and it assumes that `r` is within the valid range [0, n]. If `n` or `r` are outside this range, the function may produce incorrect results or raise an error due to the factorial calculation involving negative numbers or division by zero.
