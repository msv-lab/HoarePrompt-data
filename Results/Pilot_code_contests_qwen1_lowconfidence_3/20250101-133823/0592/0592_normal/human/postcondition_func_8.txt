The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a list of `n` inner lists, where each inner list contains `m` elements, all set to `num`. This is achieved through a nested list comprehension. The function works correctly for all valid inputs within the given constraints (i.e., `0 <= n, m <= 1,000,000` and `n + m > 0`). There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling beyond the stated constraints. The function does not perform any additional operations beyond constructing the specified list structure.
