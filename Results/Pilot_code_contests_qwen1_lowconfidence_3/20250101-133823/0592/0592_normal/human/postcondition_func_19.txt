This function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It takes multiple positional arguments (`args`) and prints them to a specified output stream (`file`), separated by a specified separator (`sep`). After the loop, it writes an end character (`end`) to the output stream and flushes the stream if requested. The function sets `at_start` to `False` during the loop to ensure no additional separators are written after the last argument. If no `sep` is provided, it defaults to a space (' '). If no `file` is provided, it defaults to `sys.stdout`. The function also handles the case where `kwargs` might contain extra unused key-value pairs, which are ignored.
