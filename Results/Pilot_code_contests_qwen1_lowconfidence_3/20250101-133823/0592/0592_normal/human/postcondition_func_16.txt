The function `func_17` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and determines whether `n` is a prime number. It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 3 and even, or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. For larger numbers, it checks divisibility by potential divisors of the form `i`, `i+2`, `i+6`, and `i+8` up to the square root of `n`. If no such divisor is found and `n` is at least 25, the function returns `True`.
