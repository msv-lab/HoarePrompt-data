You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Students in a class are making towers of blocks. Each student makes a (non-zero) tower by stacking pieces lengthwise on top of each other. n of the students use pieces made of two blocks and m of the students use pieces made of three blocks.

The students don’t want to use too many blocks, but they also want to be unique, so no two students’ towers may contain the same number of blocks. Find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers.

Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000, n + m > 0) — the number of students using two-block pieces and the number of students using three-block pieces, respectively.

Output

Print a single integer, denoting the minimum possible height of the tallest tower.

Examples

Input

1 3


Output

9


Input

3 2


Output

8


Input

5 0


Output

10

Note

In the first case, the student using two-block pieces can make a tower of height 4, and the students using three-block pieces can make towers of height 3, 6, and 9 blocks. The tallest tower has a height of 9 blocks.

In the second case, the students can make towers of heights 2, 4, and 8 with two-block pieces and towers of heights 3 and 6 with three-block pieces, for a maximum height of 8 blocks.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_19` attempts to find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers, but it contains an error in its logic.

The function `func_19` checks for a value `i` such that:
- `n <= i // 2`
- `m <= i // 3`
- `n + m <= i // 2 + i // 2 - i // 6`

However, the third condition `n + m <= i // 2 + i // 2 - i // 6` is not correctly formulated to ensure that the heights are unique and cover all required tower heights. This condition should ensure that the sum of the required towers can fit within the current value of `i`, but the formula is incorrect.

A correct approach would involve generating all possible combinations of towers that can be built with 2-block and 3-block pieces and finding the smallest `i` that can accommodate all these combinations uniquely. The current logic does not guarantee this.

For example, consider the input `(1, 3)`. The expected output is `9`, but the program might not correctly handle this case due to the flawed logic. A more robust solution would involve iterating through possible heights and checking if all required tower heights can be uniquely formed.

Since the provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 20 : This function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It takes multiple positional arguments (`args`) and prints them to a specified output stream (`file`), separated by a specified separator (`sep`). After the loop, it writes an end character (`end`) to the output stream and flushes the stream if requested. The function sets `at_start` to `False` during the loop to ensure no additional separators are written after the last argument. If no `sep` is provided, it defaults to a space (' '). If no `file` is provided, it defaults to `sys.stdout`. The function also handles the case where `kwargs` might contain extra unused key-value pairs, which are ignored.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
