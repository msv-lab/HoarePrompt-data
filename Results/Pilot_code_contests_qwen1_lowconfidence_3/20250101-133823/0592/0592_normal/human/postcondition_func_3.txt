The function `func_4` reads two space-separated integers from the standard input stream and returns a map object containing these integers as strings, separated by a space. There are no input parameters for the function. However, it does not perform any error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values or multiple spaces between integers). If the input does not conform to the expected format, the behavior is undefined, and the map object might contain unexpected elements.
