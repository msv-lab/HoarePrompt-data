The function `func_12` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a list of integers where each element is a digit from the number `n`. The function converts the integer `n` into a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string representation of `n`, converts each character back into an integer, and adds it to a list. The function handles the case where `n` is a single-digit number, returning a list with a single element. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases noted in the provided code.
