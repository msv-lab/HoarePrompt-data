#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is provided as a list of n strings, where each string represents a row of the n x n board and contains n space-separated integers. Each integer on the board is within the range [1, 100], and n is within the range [1, 30].

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an n x n board represented as a list of n strings, where each string contains n space-separated integers. It calculates the sum of each row and each column and then counts how many column sums are greater than any row sum. The function returns the count of such columns. If the input is valid (i.e., n is within [1, 30] and each string contains exactly n integers in the range [1, 100]), the function correctly computes the required count. However, if the input format is incorrect (e.g., wrong number of integers per row or out-of-range values), the function will raise an error since it relies on `int(input())` and `map(int, raw_input().split(' '))`. There are no explicit checks for these edge cases.
