Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, `col` is a list of `n` integers where each element `col[i]` is the sum of the `i`-th column of matrix `T` up to the `n-1` row.**

Explanation:
- The outer loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
- For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
- During each iteration of the inner loop, `col[i]` is incremented by `T[j][i]`.
- After the outer loop completes, `i` becomes `n` and `j` also becomes `n`.
- Since the inner loop runs for all columns, each `col[i]` (for `i` from `0` to `n-1`) accumulates the sum of the corresponding column of the matrix `T` up to the `n-1` row.
- The initial state of `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and this value remains unchanged after the loop since the loop only modifies `col[i]`.

Therefore, the final state of the variables is that `lig[i]` remains the same, `i` and `j` both become `n`, and `col` contains the sums of each column of the matrix `T` up to the `n-1` row.
