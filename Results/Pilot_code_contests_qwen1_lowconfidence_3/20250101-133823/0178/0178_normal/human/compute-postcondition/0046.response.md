The code updates the `col` list such that `col[i]` is incremented by the value of `T[j][i]`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
- `i` is `0`.
- `j` is `0`.
- `col` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the sum of the corresponding column of the matrix `T` up to the `n-1` row.

The code `col[i] += T[j][i]` will update `col[0]` (since `i` is `0`) by adding the value of `T[0][0]` (since `j` is `0`) to `col[0]`.

Let's denote the initial value of `col[0]` as `col_0_initial`.

The new value of `col[0]` will be `col_0_initial + T[0][0]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `lig[i]` remains the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
- `i` remains `0`.
- `j` remains `0`.
- `col[0]` is now `col_0_initial + T[0][0]`.
- `col[1:n]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `0`, `col[0]` is `col_0_initial + T[0][0]`, and `col[1:n]` is unchanged.**
