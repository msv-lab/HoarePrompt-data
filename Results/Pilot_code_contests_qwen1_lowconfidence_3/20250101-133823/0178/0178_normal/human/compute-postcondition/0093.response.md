Postcondition: **`compt` is 2, `i` is `n`, `j` is less than `n` and specifically `j` is `k+1` where `k` is less than `n-1`. If `j` was `n-1`, then `j` becomes `n` in the next iteration. This is because if `col[i] > lig[j]`, then `compt` is set to 2 and `j` is incremented (or reset to `n` if `j` was `n-1`).**
