According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop iterates over `range(n)`, so it continues as long as `j` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `lig[i]` is updated to its original value plus `T[i][j]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Since the loop just finished, `j` is equal to `n - 1` (the last index it processed).

To proceed with the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to become `n`, and `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore:
- `j` needs to be incremented from `n - 1` to `n`.
- `n` remains greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `lig[i]` is updated to its original value plus `T[i][n]`**
