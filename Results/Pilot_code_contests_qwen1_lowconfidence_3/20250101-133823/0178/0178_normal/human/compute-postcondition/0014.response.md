The code `lig[i] += T[i][j]` increments the value of `lig[i]` by `T[i][j]`. The initial state indicates that `n` must be greater than 0, and `lig[i]` is updated to its original value plus `T[i][n]`. However, the code uses `j` instead of `n`, which means `j` is used in the context of updating `lig[i]`.

Given this, `lig[i]` is updated to its original value plus `T[i][j]`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `lig[i]` is updated to its original value plus `T[i][j]`**
