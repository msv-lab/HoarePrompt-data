Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is `n`.
   - `col[0]` is the sum of the first column of the matrix `T` up to the `n-1` row.
   - `col[1:n]` is unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`.
   - This means the loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is already `n`, which is out of the range `0` to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute again because the loop condition `i < n` is no longer satisfied.

4. **States to Adjust for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop will not execute again, there is no need to adjust the values of `i` or `j`.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it was at the start of the loop.
   - The value of `lig[i]` does not change because `i` is not within the range of the loop.
   - The value of `col[0]` remains unchanged because it was calculated before the loop and no operations inside the loop affect it.
   - The value of `col[1:n]` remains unchanged because the loop did not modify these values.

5. **Final States:**
   - `n` is still a positive integer.
   - `lig[i]` is still the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - `i` remains `n`.
   - `j` remains `n`.
   - `col[0]` remains the sum of the first column of the matrix `T` up to the `n-1` row.
   - `col[1:n]` remains unchanged.

**State:**
**`n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, `col[0]` is the sum of the first column of the matrix `T` up to the `n-1` row, and `col[1:n]` is unchanged.**
