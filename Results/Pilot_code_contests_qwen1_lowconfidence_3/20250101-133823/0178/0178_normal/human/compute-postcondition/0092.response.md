`compt` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `compt` is 1, so it will become 2. The values of `i`, `j`, and their relationships are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `compt` is 2, `i` is `n`, `j` is less than `n` and specifically `j` is `k+1` where `k` is less than `n-1`. If `j` was `n-1`, then `j` becomes `n` in the next iteration.
