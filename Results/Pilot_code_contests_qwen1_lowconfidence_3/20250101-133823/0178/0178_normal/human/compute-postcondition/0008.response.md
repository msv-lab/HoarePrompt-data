Output State: **`T` is a 2D list of size `n x n`, where each row `T[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is a list of integers read from user input, and all other elements in `T` remain 0; `loop` is `n`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times, updating each row of the 2D list `T`.
- For each iteration `loop`, the loop reads a new list of integers from user input and assigns it to `T[loop]`.
- After `n` iterations, all rows from `T[0]` to `T[n-1]` will have been updated with lists of integers from the user input.
- All other elements in `T` (those not within the range `[0, n-1]`) remain 0 because the loop only updates these specific indices.
- The variable `loop` will be set to `n` after the loop completes its final iteration.
