According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop continues as long as `j < n`. At the end of the last iteration, `compt` is 2, `i` is `n`, `j` is less than `n`, and specifically `j` is `k+1` where `k` is less than `n-1`. If `j` was `n-1`, then `j` becomes `n` in the next iteration.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Current State**: 
   - `compt` is 2
   - `i` is `n`
   - `j` is less than `n` and specifically `j` is `k+1` where `k` is less than `n-1`
   - If `j` was `n-1`, then `j` becomes `n` in the next iteration

2. **Next Iteration Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `j` is currently `k+1` where `k` is less than `n-1`, in the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become `k+2`.
   - If `j` was `n-1` in the previous iteration, it would reset to `n` in the current iteration. However, since `j` is specified to be `k+1` where `k` is less than `n-1`, it cannot be `n-1` in the current state.

Given this, we can conclude that `j` will increment by 1 in the next iteration. Thus, `j` will be `k+2` in the next iteration, ensuring that `j` remains less than `n`.

State: **`compt` is 2, `i` is `n`, `j` is `k+2` where `k` is less than `n-1**.
