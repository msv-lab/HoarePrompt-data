`compt` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `compt` was determined based on conditions involving `col` and `lig`. Since the code only increments `compt` by 1, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig` plus 1 if `col[n-1]` is greater than `lig[0]`, otherwise `compt` remains unchanged; `compt` is incremented by 1; `j` is `n-1`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig` plus 1 if `col[n-1]` is greater than `lig[0]`, otherwise `compt` remains unchanged; `compt` is incremented by 1; `j` is `n-1`**
