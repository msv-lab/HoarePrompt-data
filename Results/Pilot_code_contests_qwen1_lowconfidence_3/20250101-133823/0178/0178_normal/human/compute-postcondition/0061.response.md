The code `compt = 0` initializes the variable `compt` to 0. This assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the only change is the initialization of `compt`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, `col` is a list of `n` integers where each element `col[i]` is the sum of the `i`-th column of matrix `T` up to the `n-1` row, `compt` is `0`**
