Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State Information:**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `compt` is the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig` if the loop executed, otherwise `compt` remains the initial value of `compt` (which is 0).
   - `i` is `n-1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`.

3. **Next Iteration Check:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` should become `n`.

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since `i` starts at `n-1` and needs to be incremented to `n` for the next iteration, we set `i` to `n`.
   - The value of `compt` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it. Given no modification in the loop body was specified, `compt` stays as it is (either 0 or its updated value based on previous iterations).

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` becomes `n`.
   - `compt` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

**State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig` if the loop executed, otherwise `compt` remains the initial value of `compt` (which is 0), and `i` is `n`**.
