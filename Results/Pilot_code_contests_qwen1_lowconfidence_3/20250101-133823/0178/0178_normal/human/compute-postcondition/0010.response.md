Let's break down the given state and the for loop step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
1. `T` is a 2D list of size `n x n`, where each row `T[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is a list of integers read from user input, and all other elements in `T` remain 0.
2. `loop` is `n`.
3. `lig` is a list of `n` elements, each set to 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`.
   - To enter the loop, `i` must be within this range. Since `i` starts at 0, it will always be valid within the loop as long as the loop condition holds.

2. **Variable `loop`:**
   - The variable `loop` is set to `n`. This value is used to control the number of iterations of the loop.
   - The loop will run `n` times, so `loop` being `n` ensures that the loop will execute properly.

3. **Variable `T`:**
   - `T` is an `n x n` matrix where each row is populated with integers based on user input.
   - All elements outside the rows specified by the user input are set to 0.
   - Since the loop iterates over `range(n)`, `T[i]` will be accessed, but only if `i` is within the valid range of the matrix. This is guaranteed because the loop will only iterate from 0 to `n-1`.

4. **Variable `lig`:**
   - `lig` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to 0.
   - There are no operations on `lig` within the loop that would affect its initial state or the loop's execution.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the key states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` should be within the range of `0` to `n-1`.
- `loop` should be `n` to ensure the loop runs `n` times.

Since `i` will naturally start at 0 and increase, the critical adjustment needed is ensuring that `loop` is `n`.

### Final State Adjustment:
State: **`loop` is `n`**
