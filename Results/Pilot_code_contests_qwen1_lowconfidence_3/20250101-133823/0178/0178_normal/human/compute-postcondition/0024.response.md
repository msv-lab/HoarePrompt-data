The code updates `lig[i]` by adding `T[i][j]` to its current value. Given the initial state, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `2`. Therefore, the code modifies `lig[n]` by adding `T[n][2]` to its current value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value plus `T[n][1]` and now also plus `T[n][2]; i` is `n`; `j` is `2`.**
