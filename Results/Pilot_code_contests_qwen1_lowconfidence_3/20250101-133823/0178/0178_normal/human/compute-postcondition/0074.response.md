According to the code, the loop condition is based on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `compt` is the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig`.
- `col[i]` is an element of the list `col`.
- `lig[j]` is an element of the list `lig`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, if `i` was equal to `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be equal to `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`, meaning `i` is now `n-1` and the condition `i < n` still holds.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig`, `col[i]` is an element of the list `col` where `i` is `n-1`, and `lig[j]` is an element of the list `lig`**.
