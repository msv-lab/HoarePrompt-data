Output State: **`compt` is the number of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig` at the start of the loop, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `n`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution and Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`. For each `j`, it checks if `col[i] > lig[j]`. Here, `i` is always `n`, so the condition simplifies to checking if `col[n] > lig[j]`.

2. **Incrementing `compt`**: Each time the condition `col[n] > lig[j]` is true, `compt` is incremented by 1. This happens for every `j` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Final Values**:
   - **`compt`**: It counts the number of elements in `col` (at index `n`) that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig`.
   - **`i`**: Remains `n` throughout the loop because `i` is not modified within the loop.
   - **`j`**: After the loop completes, `j` would be `n` since the loop increments `j` from `0` to `n-1` and then exits, setting `j` to `n`.

4. **Non-Execution Case**: If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is `0`), `compt` remains `0` and `j` is `0`.

Thus, after the loop executes all its iterations, `compt` will be the count of elements in `col` (at index `n`) that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig`. The final values of `i` and `j` are `n` and `n`, respectively.
