The code `col[i] += T[j][i]` updates the value of `col[i]` by adding the value of `T[j][i]` to it. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
- `i` is `0`.
- `j` is `1`.
- `col[1:n]` is unchanged.

The code updates `col[0]` (since `i` is `0`) by adding the value of `T[1][0]` (since `j` is `1`) to it. The states of other variables and sublists are not affected.

So, the updated state is:
- `col[0]` is updated to its original value plus `T[1][0]`.
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `lig[i]` remains the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
- `i` remains `0`.
- `j` remains `1`.
- `col[1:n]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`col[0]` is its original value plus `T[1][0]`, `n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `1`, and `col[1:n]` is unchanged.**
