Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `compt` is incremented by 1.
   - `col[i]` is an element of the list `col`.
   - `lig[j+1]` is an element of the list `lig`.
   - This condition holds true if `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For each iteration, the loop checks the condition `col[i] > lig[j]`.

4. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, the loop will execute one more time if `j` is less than `n-1`.
   - After the current iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `n` remains the same as it was before the loop started.
   - `compt` is incremented by 1, so it will be `compt + 1`.
   - `col[i]` remains the same.
   - `lig[j+1]` will become `lig[j+2]` because `j` will be incremented by 1.

6. **Final States:**
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `compt` will be incremented by 1.
   - `col[i]` is still an element of the list `col`.
   - `lig[j+1]` will now be `lig[j+2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `compt` is incremented by 1, `col[i]` is an element of the list `col`, `lig[j+2]` is an element of the list `lig`.**
