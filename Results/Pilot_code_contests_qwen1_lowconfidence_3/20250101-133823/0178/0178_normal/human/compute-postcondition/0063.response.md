State: **`n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The given for loop is `for j in range(n):`.
2. The `range(n)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, the sequence must contain at least one number.
4. This means `n` must be greater than 0 to generate a non-empty sequence.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `n` must be greater than 0.
