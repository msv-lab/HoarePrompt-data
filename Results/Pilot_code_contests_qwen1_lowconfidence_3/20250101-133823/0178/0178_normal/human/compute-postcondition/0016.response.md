The code snippet updates the value of `lig[i]` by adding `T[i][j]` to it. Since `j` was at `n-1` in the previous iteration and the loop increments `j` by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `n`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the updated state after executing the line `lig[i] += T[i][j]` is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `j` is updated to `n`; `lig[i]` is updated to its original value plus `T[i][j]`**
