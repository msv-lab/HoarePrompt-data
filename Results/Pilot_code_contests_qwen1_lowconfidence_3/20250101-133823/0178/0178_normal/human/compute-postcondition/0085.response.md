Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig` if the loop executed, otherwise `compt` remains the initial value of `compt` (which is 0), and `i` is `n-1`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each index `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
2. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, the condition `if col[i] > lig[j]: compt += 1` checks if the element `col[i]` (where `i` is always `n-1`) is greater than the element `lig[j]` at the current iteration.
3. **Count Increment**: If the condition is true, `compt` is incremented by 1. This happens for each `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
4. **Final Value of `compt`**: After the loop completes, `compt` will be the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0), `compt` remains its initial value, which is 0. For any `n > 0`, the loop will execute and `compt` will be updated accordingly.

Thus, the final output state is that `compt` will be the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig` if the loop executed, otherwise `compt` remains 0, and `i` is `n-1`.
