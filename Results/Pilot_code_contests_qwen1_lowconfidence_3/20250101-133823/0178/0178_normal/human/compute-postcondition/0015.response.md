Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial States**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `n` must be greater than 0. The state also mentions that `lig[i]` is updated to its original value plus `T[i][j]`.

2. **Understand the Loop**: The given loop is:
   ```python
   for j in range(n):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.

4. **Analyze the Last Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented within the loop, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` must have been equal to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented to `n`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 because the condition for the outer loop (which this loop is part of) would depend on `n`.
   - `lig[i]` is updated to its original value plus `T[i][j]`, so we don't need to change this directly unless we know the new value of `j`.

6. **Final State**:
   - Since `j` needs to be incremented to `n`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `n`.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0.

So, the final state is:

**State: `n` must be greater than 0; `j` is updated to `n`; `lig[i]` is updated to its original value plus `T[i][j]`**
