Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value plus `T[n][1]`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is `1`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increment from `1` to `2` (the next value within the range `range(n)`).

4. **Modifying the States:**
   - Since `j` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, after the current iteration, `j` will be `2`.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged as it does not depend on the loop variable `j`.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `n` is still a positive integer.
   - `lig[n]` remains the same as it was not modified in the loop.
   - `i` remains `n`.
   - `j` is now `2`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value plus `T[n][1]`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `2`**
