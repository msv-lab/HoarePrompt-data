Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `col` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - `j` must be in the range `[0, n)`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs for `j` in the range `range(n)`. This means `j` starts from `0` and goes up to `n-1`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `j` is currently `n-1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to increment by 1 (assuming `j` is an integer). Therefore, `j` should become `n`.

5. **Checking the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition checks if `j` is in the range `[0, n)`. Since `j` will be `n` after the increment, it will no longer be in the range `[0, n)`. Thus, the loop will terminate after this iteration.

6. **Modifying the States:**
   - `j` will be incremented to `n`.
   - `col` remains unchanged as the loop body is omitted and there is no modification to `col` in the given information.

Given these steps, we can now update the states for the next iteration:

**State:**
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is `n` (after incrementing from `n-1`).
- `col` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `j` is no longer in the range `[0, n)` (loop terminates).

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, `col` is a list of `n` zeros, `j` is not in the range `[0, n)`**.
