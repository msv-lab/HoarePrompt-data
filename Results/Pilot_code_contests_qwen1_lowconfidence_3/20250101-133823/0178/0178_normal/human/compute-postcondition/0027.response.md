State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[n]` starting from index 0 up to index `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0**

### Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in range(n):` will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `lig[n]` is already defined and computed based on the sublist `T[n]`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `j` is `n-1`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `j` (which is initially `n-1`) must be less than `n`.
   - If `j` equals `n-1`, then the loop condition `j < n` will evaluate to `False` on the first iteration, and the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - To ensure the loop can start executing, `j` must be less than `n` initially.
   - Since `j` is `n-1`, this means `n` itself must be greater than 0 for the loop to start.

5. **Final State**:
   - Ensure `n` is greater than 0.
   - Keep the initial values of `lig[n]`, `i`, and `j` as they are.

Thus, the required state adjustments are:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[n]` starting from index 0 up to index `n-1`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `j` is `n-1`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[n]` starting from index 0 up to index `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
