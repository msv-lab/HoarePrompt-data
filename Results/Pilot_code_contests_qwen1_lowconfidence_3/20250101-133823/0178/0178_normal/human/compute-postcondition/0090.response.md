Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `compt` is 1, `i` is `n`, and `j` is less than `n`. After the execution, if `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`, then `compt` is incremented by 1. There is no else part, so the values of `compt`, `i`, and `j` remain as specified in the if part if the condition is not met.***
