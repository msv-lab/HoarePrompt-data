Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[n]` starting from index 0 up to index `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`**.

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: 
  - `n` is a positive integer.
  - `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[n]` starting from index 0 up to index `n-1`.
  - `i` is `n`.
  - `j` is `n`.

- **Loop Execution**:
  - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
  - In each iteration, `lig[i]` is updated by adding `T[i][j]` to `lig[i]`.

- **After Loop Executes All Iterations**:
  - After the loop completes, `j` will be `n-1` because the loop runs until `j` reaches `n-1`.
  - `lig[i]` will be the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[i]` from index 0 to `n-1`.

- **Final Values**:
  - Since `i` is always `n` during the loop, the final value of `lig[n]` will be the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[n]` from index 0 to `n-1`.

- **If the Loop Does Not Execute**:
  - If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `lig[0]` remains as its original value, which is the sum of the original value and an empty sublist (0 elements).

Thus, after the loop finishes executing, the values of the variables will reflect the sum of `lig[n]` with all elements in the sublist `T[n]` from index 0 to `n-1`.
