Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[i]` starting from index 0 up to index `n-1`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range `n`, updating the variable `lig[i]` by adding the corresponding element from the sublist `T[i]`.
- After `n` iterations, `lig[i]` will hold the sum of its original value and all elements from `T[i][0]` to `T[i][n-1]`.
- If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `lig[i]` remains unchanged (equal to its original value).
- If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executes and updates `lig[i]` to include the sum of the specified elements.
