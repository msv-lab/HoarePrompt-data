Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `compt` is 1.
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is less than `n`.

### For Loop:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from `0` to `n-1`. This means the loop iterates over all integers from `0` to `n-1`.
2. **Loop Body**: Inside the loop, there is an if condition that checks if `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`. If true, `compt` is incremented by 1. If false, `compt`, `i`, and `j` retain their current values.

### Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `j` is less than `n`. Let's assume `j` is currently `k` where `0 â‰¤ k < n-1`.

### Next Iteration:
- After the current iteration (where `j` is `k`), `j` will increment by 1, so `j` will become `k+1`.
- Since `k` was less than `n-1`, `k+1` will be less than `n` unless `k` is `n-1`. If `k` is `n-1`, then the loop will terminate after this iteration because the next value of `j` would be `n`, which is not within the range of `range(n)`.

### State Adjustment for the Next Iteration:
- `compt` remains 1 unless the condition inside the loop is true, but since we don't know the outcome of the loop body, we keep it as 1.
- `i` remains `n`.
- `j` becomes `k+1`, which is still less than `n` unless `k` was `n-1`.

If `k` was `n-1`, then the loop terminates. Otherwise, `j` will be `k+1`.

### Final State:
- `compt` is 1.
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is `k+1` where `k` is less than `n-1`.

### Updated State:
State: **`compt` is 1, `i` is `n`, `j` is less than `n` and specifically `j` is `k+1` where `k` is less than `n-1`**.

Since `j` can only be `n-1` if it was `n-2` in the previous iteration, and it increments by 1 each time, we can generalize the final state as:

State: **`compt` is 1, `i` is `n`, `j` is less than `n` and specifically `j` is `k+1` where `k` is less than `n-1`**.

To be more precise, if `j` was `n-1` in the previous iteration, then `j` will be `n` in the next iteration, causing the loop to terminate.

### Conclusion:
- `compt` remains 1.
- `i` remains `n`.
- `j` becomes `n` if `j` was `n-1` previously, otherwise `j` becomes `k+1` where `k` is less than `n-1`.

Final State: **`compt` is 1, `i` is `n`, `j` is less than `n` and specifically `j` is `k+1` where `k` is less than `n-1`. If `j` was `n-1`, then `j` becomes `n` in the next iteration.**
