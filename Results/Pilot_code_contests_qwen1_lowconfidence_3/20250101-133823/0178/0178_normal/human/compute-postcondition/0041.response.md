Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is `n` (out of range).
- `col` is a list of `n` zeros.
- The assignment `col[i] += T[j][i]` does not execute because both `i` and `j` are out of range.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from `0` to `n-1`.
2. **Current Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` and `j` are both equal to `n`, which means they are out of range for the list `col` and `T` since their valid indices are from `0` to `n-1`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to iterate from `0` to `n-1`. Since `j` is currently `n`, the loop will not execute at all in this iteration.
- The value of `i` remains `n` as it was not modified in the loop body.
- The value of `j` will increment from `n` to `n+1`, but since the loop only runs for values from `0` to `n-1`, `j` will effectively be `0` in the first iteration of the new loop.
- The list `col` and the sublist `T` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since no modifications are mentioned, they stay as they were.

### Adjusted States:
- `n` remains the same as it was not modified.
- `i` remains `n` as it was not modified.
- `j` starts from `0` in the next iteration of the loop.
- `col` remains a list of `n` zeros.
- `lig` remains the same as it was not modified.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `0`, `col` is a list of `n` zeros**.
