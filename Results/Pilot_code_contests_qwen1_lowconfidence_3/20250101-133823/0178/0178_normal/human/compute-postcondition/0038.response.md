The code `col[i] += T[j][i]` impacts the variable `col` by adding the value of `T[j][i]` to `col[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is equal to `n`, and `j` is equal to `n-1`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, the assignment `col[i] += T[j][i]` tries to access `col[n]`, which is out of bounds because `col` has `n` elements indexed from 0 to `n-1`.

Therefore, no changes are made to any of the variables due to this operation. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `col` is a list of `n` zeros, `j` must be in the range `[0, n)`**
