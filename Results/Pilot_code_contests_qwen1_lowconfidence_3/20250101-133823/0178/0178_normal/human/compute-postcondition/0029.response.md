Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[n]` starting from index 0 up to index `n-1`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `lig[n-1]` is updated to its original value plus `T[n-1][n-1]`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop variable `j` iterates over the range from `0` to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n-1`.

4. **Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `j` is currently `n-1`, the next value of `j` would be `n-1 + 1 = n`.
   - However, the range function `range(n)` does not include `n`, so `j` needs to be `n-2` or less.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a constant within the loop.
   - `lig[n]` remains unchanged because the loop has not yet executed.
   - `i` remains unchanged at `n-1` because the loop has not yet executed.
   - `j` needs to be `n-2` to allow the loop to execute one more time.

6. **Final State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `lig[n]` is the same as before.
   - `i` is still `n-1`.
   - `j` is `n-2`.

**Answer:**
State: **`n` is a positive integer; `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[n]` starting from index 0 up to index `n-1`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `n-2`**
