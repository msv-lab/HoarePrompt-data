The code updates the value of `col[i]` by adding `T[j][i]` to it. However, the values of `i` and `j` are such that `j` is out of the range `[0, n)`, meaning the condition for the loop termination has already been met and `j` is no longer within the valid range. Therefore, this assignment statement will not execute because the loop that would normally control the value of `j` has already terminated.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n` (out of range), `col` is a list of `n` zeros, and the assignment `col[i] += T[j][i]` does not execute.**
