Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig`, `col[i]` is an element of the list `col`, and `lig[j]` is an element of the list `lig`.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial Values and Loop Condition**: The loop runs `n` times, where `n` is a non-negative integer. Each iteration checks if `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`. If true, `compt` is incremented.
- **Variable `compt`**: After the loop completes, `compt` will be the total count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig`. The loop condition ensures that each element in `col` is compared against every element in `lig` exactly once.
- **Variables `col[i]` and `lig[j]`**: These variables represent the current elements being compared in each iteration. The loop iterates over all elements of `col` and compares them with all elements of `lig`. Thus, `col[i]` and `lig[j]` are placeholders for any arbitrary elements from their respective lists during the comparison.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0):
- **Variable `compt`**: `compt` remains 0.
- **Variables `col[i]` and `lig[j]`**: These variables retain their initial values from the initial state, but since no comparisons are made, they do not change within the loop context.

This final state accurately captures the values and relationships of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.
