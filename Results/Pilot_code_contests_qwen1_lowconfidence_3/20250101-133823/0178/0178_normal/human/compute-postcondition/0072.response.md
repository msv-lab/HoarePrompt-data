Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `compt` is incremented by 1 (new value is `compt + 1`), `col[i]` is an element of the list `col`, `lig[j+2]` is an element of the list `lig`. If `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`, then `compt` is incremented by 1. There is no additional change to the values of `n`, `compt`, `col[i]`, and `lig[j+2]` in the else part since no other operations are specified.***
