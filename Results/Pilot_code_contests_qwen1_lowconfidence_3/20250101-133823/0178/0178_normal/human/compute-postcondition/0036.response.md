State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `col` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` must be less than `n`**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Initialization and Condition**: The loop `for i in range(n)` will iterate over the range from `0` to `n-1`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - `i` is initially set to `n`.
   - `j` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `col` is a list of `n` zeros.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be less than `n`. Currently, `i` is set to `n`, which means the condition `i < n` is false, and the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - To ensure the loop can start executing, we need to adjust the initial value of `i` to be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `i` is less than `n`.
