The code updates `col[i]` by adding the value of `T[j][i]` to `col[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `col[0]` is its original value plus `T[1][0]`
- `n` is a positive integer
- `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`
- `i` is `0`
- `j` is `2`
- `col[1:n]` is unchanged

Since `i` is `0` and `j` is `2`, the code snippet `col[i] += T[j][i]` translates to `col[0] += T[2][0]`.

Given the initial state of `col[0]` being its original value plus `T[1][0]`, after executing the code, `col[0]` will be updated to its original value plus `T[1][0]` plus `T[2][0]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`col[0]` is its original value plus `T[1][0]` plus `T[2][0]`, `n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `2`, and `col[1:n]` is unchanged**
