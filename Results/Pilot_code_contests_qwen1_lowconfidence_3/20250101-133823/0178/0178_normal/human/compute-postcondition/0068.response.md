`compt` is incremented by 1. The initial values of `n`, `col[i]`, and `lig[j+1]` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `compt` and retains the initial values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `compt` is incremented by 1, `col[i]` is an element of the list `col`, `lig[j+1]` is an element of the list `lig`**
