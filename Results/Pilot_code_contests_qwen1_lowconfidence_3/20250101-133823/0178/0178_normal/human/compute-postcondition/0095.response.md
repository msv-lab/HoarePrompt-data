The value of `compt` is incremented by 1, starting from 2. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the output state is: `compt` is 3, `i` is `n`, `j` is `k+2` where `k` is less than `n-1`.

Output State: **`compt` is 3, `i` is `n`, `j` is `k+2` where `k` is less than `n-1**.
