The code `print(compt)` prints the value of `compt` but does not change its value. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, and `compt` is printed.**
