The code snippet `T[loop] = list(map(int, raw_input().split(' ')))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input, converts each integer using `map(int, ...)` and then assigns the resulting list to `T[loop]`. 

Given the initial state where `T` is a 2D list of size `n x n` with all elements initialized to 0, and considering that `loop` is a variable that needs to be defined in the context of the program (which is not specified here), let's assume `loop` is set to 0 for the first iteration.

- The initial state of `T` is a 2D list of size `n x n` filled with zeros.
- `T[0]` is assigned a list of integers read from the input.

Since `loop` is 0, `T[0]` will be updated to a new list of integers. The values of the other elements in `T` remain unchanged, and `loop` itself is updated to the next index after this operation.

Let's denote the input as `input_string`, which contains space-separated integers. After the input is processed and converted to integers, `T[0]` will be assigned this list.

Output State: **`T` is a 2D list of size `n x n`, with `T[0]` being a list of integers from the input, and all other elements in `T` are still 0; `loop` is 1.**
