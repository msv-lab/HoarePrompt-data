`compt` is incremented by 1, which means `compt += 1`. The value of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `col[i]` being greater than `lig[j]` is also unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `compt` is 1, `i` is `n`, and `j` is less than `n`. The current value of `col[i]` is greater than the value of `lig[j]`**
