Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig`, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `n`.**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The outer loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - The inner loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`.
   - The condition inside the inner loop checks if `col[i] > lig[j]`.
   - For each iteration, `compt` is incremented if the condition is true.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - `i` starts at `n` and is updated inside the loop.
   - `j` starts at `n` and is updated inside the loop.
   - `col` is a list of `n` integers where each element `col[i]` is the sum of the `i`-th column of matrix `T` up to the `n-1` row.
   - `compt` starts at `0`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n` and `j` starts at `n`, the loop will only execute if `n` is 0. If `n` is 0, the loops will not run, and `compt` remains `0`.
   - If `n` is greater than 0, the outer loop will run `n` times. For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop will run `n` times.

4. **Final State**:
   - After the loops complete, `i` and `j` will both be `n` because they are incremented within the loops and set to `n` after the loops finish.
   - `compt` will be the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig`. This count is determined by the conditions inside the nested loops.
   - The values of `lig[i]` and `col[i]` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Regardless of whether the loops execute or not, the final values of `i` and `j` will be `n`.
   - `compt` will hold the count of elements in `col` that satisfy the condition `col[i] > lig[j]`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig`, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `n`.**
