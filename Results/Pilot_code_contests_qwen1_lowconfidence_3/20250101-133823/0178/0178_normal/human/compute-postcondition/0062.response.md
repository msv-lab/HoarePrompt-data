Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is `n`.
   - `col` is a list of `n` integers where each element `col[i]` is the sum of the `i`-th column of matrix `T` up to the `n-1` row.
   - `compt` is `0`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(n)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must start from `0` and increment until `n-1`. Given that `i` is currently `n`, the loop will not execute because `i` must be less than `n` to enter the loop.
   - We need to set `i` to `0` to allow the loop to start.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `j` being `n` doesn't affect the loop condition since the loop runs based on `i`.
   - `lig`, `col`, and `compt` don't directly influence the loop's execution; they are part of the state within the loop body.

Therefore, the key adjustment needed is to set `i` to `0` to ensure the loop can start executing.

**State:**
**`n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `i` is 0, `j` is `n`, `col` is a list of `n` integers where each element `col[i]` is the sum of the `i`-th column of matrix `T` up to the `n-1` row, `compt` is `0`**
