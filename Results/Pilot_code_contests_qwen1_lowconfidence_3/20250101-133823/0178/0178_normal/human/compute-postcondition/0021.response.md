According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop condition is `j in range(n)`, meaning `j` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value and `T[n][0]`
- `i` is `n`
- `j` is `0`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (since it starts from 0). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `1`.

Since the loop condition is `j < n`, as long as `j` is incremented to `1`, the loop will execute if `n > 1`.

Thus, the states to be adjusted are:
- `n` remains a positive integer
- `lig[n]` remains the sum of its original value and `T[n][0]`
- `i` remains `n`
- `j` is incremented to `1`

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value and `T[n][0]`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `1`**
