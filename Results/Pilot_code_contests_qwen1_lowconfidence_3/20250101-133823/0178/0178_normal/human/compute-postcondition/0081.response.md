Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig` plus 1 if `col[n-1]` is greater than `lig[0]`, otherwise `compt` remains unchanged; `j` is `n-1`, and `compt` is incremented by 1 if `col[i] > lig[j]` is true, otherwise `compt` remains unchanged.***
