Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `lig[n-1]` is the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[n-1]` from index 0 to index `n-1`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `0`.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[n]` starting from index 0 up to index `n-1`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `j` is `n-1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - In each iteration, `lig[i]` is updated by adding `T[i][j]` to `lig[i]`.

3. **First Iteration (j = n-1)**:
   - `lig[i]` (which is `lig[n-1]`) is updated by adding `T[n-1][n-1]` to its original value.
   - State after 1 iteration: `lig[n-1]` is the original value plus `T[n-1][n-1]`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `n-1`.

4. **Second Iteration (j = n-2)**:
   - `lig[i]` (which is still `lig[n-1]`) is updated by adding `T[n-1][n-2]` to its current value.
   - State after 2 iterations: `lig[n-1]` is the original value plus `T[n-1][n-2]` plus `T[n-1][n-1]`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `n-2`.

5. **Third Iteration (j = n-3)**:
   - `lig[i]` (which is still `lig[n-1]`) is updated by adding `T[n-1][n-3]` to its current value.
   - This pattern continues until `j` reaches `0`.

6. **Final Iteration (j = 0)**:
   - `lig[i]` (which is still `lig[n-1]`) is updated by adding `T[n-1][0]` to its current value.
   - After all iterations, `lig[n-1]` is the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[n-1]` from index 0 to index `n-1`.

7. **Post-loop State**:
   - The loop will stop after `j` becomes `0`, meaning `j` will be `0` and `i` will still be `n-1`.
   - Therefore, the final state is `lig[n-1]` is the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[n-1]` from index 0 to index `n-1`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `0`.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations of the loop, `lig[n-1]` contains the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[n-1]` from index 0 to index `n-1`, while `i` remains `n-1` and `j` becomes `0`.
