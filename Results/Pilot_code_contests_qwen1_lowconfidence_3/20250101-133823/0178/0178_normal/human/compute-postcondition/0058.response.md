`col[i]` is updated to its original value plus `T[0][i]` and then further incremented by `T[j][i]`. Given that `j` is 1, the new value of `col[i]` is its original value plus `T[0][i]` plus `T[1][i]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `col[i]` is its original value plus `T[0][i]` plus `T[1][i]`**
