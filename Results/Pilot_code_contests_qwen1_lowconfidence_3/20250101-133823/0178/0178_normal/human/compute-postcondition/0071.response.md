`compt` is incremented by 1, which means its new value is the previous value of `compt` plus 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `compt` is incremented by 1 (new value is `compt + 1`), `col[i]` is an element of the list `col`, `lig[j+2]` is an element of the list `lig`.**
