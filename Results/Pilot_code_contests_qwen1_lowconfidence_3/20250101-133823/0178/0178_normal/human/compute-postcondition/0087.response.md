Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variable and its initial state:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The initial value of `j` is set to `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop runs as long as `j < n`.
   - For the loop to execute even once, `j` must be less than `n` initially.

3. **Initial values of other relevant variables:**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `compt` is the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig` if the loop executed, otherwise `compt` remains the initial value of `compt` (which is 0).
   - `i` is equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition:**
   - Since `j` starts at `n`, the loop will not execute because `j` is not less than `n`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the initial state such that `j` starts at a value less than `n`.

5. **Final state after adjustment:**
   - `n` remains a non-negative integer.
   - `compt` remains the initial value of 0.
   - `i` is still equal to `n`.
   - To allow the loop to execute, `j` must start at a value less than `n`.

Based on this analysis, the adjusted state should be:

**`n` is a non-negative integer, `compt` is 0, `i` is `n`, and `j` must be less than `n`**.

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `compt` is 0, `i` is `n`, and `j` must be less than `n`**.
