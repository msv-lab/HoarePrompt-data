`compt` is incremented by 1. Since `compt` was previously the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig`, and `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`, the new value of `compt` is the previous value of `compt` plus 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig` plus 1, `col[i]` is an element of the list `col` where `i` is `n-1`, and `lig[j]` is an element of the list `lig` where `j` is 0, and `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`. `n` must be greater than 0.**
