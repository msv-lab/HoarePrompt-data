Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, `col` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the sum of the corresponding column of the matrix `T` up to the `n-1` row, `j` must be in the range `[0, n)` but after the loop completes, `j` will exceed this range.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
- For each `j`, `col[i]` is incremented by `T[j][i]`.
- Since `i` is always `n`, the assignment `col[i] += T[j][i]` will always result in an `IndexError` because `col` is a list of length `n` and indexing with `n` is out of bounds.
- Therefore, no valid assignments are made to `col` during the loop execution.
- After the loop completes, `j` will exceed its valid range `[0, n)`, but `col` will still be a list of `n` zeros since no updates were made to it.

This final state indicates that `col` remains unchanged as a list of `n` zeros, while `i` and `j` reflect the end state of the loop counter.
