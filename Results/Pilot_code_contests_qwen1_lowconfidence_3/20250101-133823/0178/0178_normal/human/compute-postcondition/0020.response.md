The code `lig[i] += T[i][j]` updates the value of `lig[i]` by adding `T[i][j]` to it. Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer,
- `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[n]` starting from index 0 up to index `n-1`,
- `i` is `n`,
- `j` is 0.

We know that `i` is equal to `n`, and `j` is 0. So, the code effectively updates `lig[n]` by adding `T[n][0]` to it.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value and `T[n][0]`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0**
