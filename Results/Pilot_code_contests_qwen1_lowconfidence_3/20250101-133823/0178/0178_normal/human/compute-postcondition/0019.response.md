State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[n]` starting from index 0 up to index `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The for loop `for j in range(n):` means that the loop will iterate from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`.
2. For the loop to execute, `j` must start from 0 and increment until it reaches `n-1`.
3. Since the loop variable `j` is initialized within the for loop itself, we do not need to adjust `j`'s initial value; however, we need to ensure that `j` is 0 at the start of the loop.
4. The other variables (`n`, `lig`, and `T`) do not affect the loop's execution directly but should be consistent with their definitions.

Thus, the state before the loop should include `n` as a positive integer, `lig[n]` being the sum of its original value and the sublist `T[n]`, `i` being `n`, and `j` being 0.
