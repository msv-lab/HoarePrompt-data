State before the loop starts: 
```
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved**: The variables involved in the loop are `j` and `n`.
   - `j`: This is the loop variable that will take values from 0 up to but not including `n`.
   - `n`: This is the upper limit of the loop.

2. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j < n`.

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `j` starts at 0 (the initial value for the range function).
   - `n` is an input parameter that defines the number of iterations.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0 because if `n` is 0 or less, `j` will never be less than `n` and the loop will not execute.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0, we don't need to explicitly adjust its value.
   - We need to ensure `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
