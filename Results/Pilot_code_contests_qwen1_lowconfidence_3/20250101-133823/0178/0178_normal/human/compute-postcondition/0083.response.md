`compt` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains the same, and `j` is initially equal to `n`. Therefore, the updated state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `n`, and `compt` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `n`, and `compt` is incremented by 1**
