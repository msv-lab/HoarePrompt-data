`lig[i]` is updated by adding `T[i][j]` to its current value. From the initial state, we know that `i` is equal to `n` and `j` is equal to `1`. So, `lig[i]` is equivalent to `lig[n]` and `T[i][j]` is equivalent to `T[n][1]`. The initial state also tells us that `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value and `T[n][0]`.

After executing the code `lig[i] += T[i][j]`, the value of `lig[n]` will be updated to its current value plus the value of `T[n][1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value (which was the sum of its original value and `T[n][0]`) and `T[n][1]`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value plus `T[n][1]`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `1`**
