State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig`, `col[i]` is an element of the list `col` where `i` is `n-1`, and `lig[j]` is an element of the list `lig`, `j` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
2. For the loop to execute, the variable `j` must be initialized to `0` and `n` must be at least `1` (since `range(n)` generates numbers from `0` to `n-1`).
3. At the start of the loop, `j` will be `0`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is set to `0` and `n` is at least `1`.

So, the required adjustments are to set `j` to `0` and ensure `n` is greater than `0`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig`, `col[i]` is an element of the list `col` where `i` is `n-1`, and `lig[j]` is an element of the list `lig`, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
