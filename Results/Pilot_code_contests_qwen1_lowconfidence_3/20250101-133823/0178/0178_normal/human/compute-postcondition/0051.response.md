Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, and `col[0]` is the sum of the first column of the matrix `T` up to the `n-1` row, and `col[1:n]` is unchanged.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - `i` is `0`.
   - `j` is `n+1`.
   - `col` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the sum of the corresponding column of the matrix `T` up to the `n-1` row.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`.
   - For each iteration, `col[i]` is updated by adding `T[j][i]`.

3. **After Loop Execution**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `n` because the loop increments `j` up to `n-1` and then stops.
   - `j` will be `n` because the loop exits when `j` reaches `n-1` and the loop body is not executed for `j=n`.
   - `col[0]` will be the sum of the first column of the matrix `T` up to the `n-1` row because it accumulates the values from `T[0][0]` to `T[n-1][0]`.
   - `col[1:n]` remains unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.

4. **Final State**:
   - All the conditions and values are consistent with the loop executing fully and updating `col[0]` correctly.
   - The other elements of `col` remain the same as their initial values because they are not modified in the loop.
