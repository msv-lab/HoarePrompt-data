The code initializes a new list `lig` with `n` elements, each set to 0. This does not affect the values of `T` or `loop`. The output state includes the updated value of `lig` and retains the initial state of `T` and `loop`.

Output State: **`T` is a 2D list of size `n x n`, where each row `T[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is a list of integers read from user input, and all other elements in `T` remain 0; `loop` is `n`; `lig` is a list of `n` elements, each set to 0.**
