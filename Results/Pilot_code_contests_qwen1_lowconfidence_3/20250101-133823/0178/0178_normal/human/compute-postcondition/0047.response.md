According to the given code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
- `i` is `0`.
- `j` is `0`.
- `col[0]` is `col_0_initial + T[0][0]`.
- `col[1:n]` is unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be `1`.

Since the loop condition is `j < n`, the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`. Given that `i` remains unchanged and `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` up to the previous iteration, these values do not change within the loop.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `j`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `1`, and `col[1:n]` is unchanged.**
