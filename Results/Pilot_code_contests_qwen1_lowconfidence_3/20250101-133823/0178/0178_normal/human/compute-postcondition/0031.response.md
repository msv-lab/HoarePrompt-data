Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `lig[n-1]` is the original value of `lig[n-1]` plus `T[n-1][n-2]`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `j` is `n-2`.

### For Loop Statement
```
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < n`.
2. **Current Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n-2`. This means the loop is about to check if `j+1` (which would be `n-1`) is still less than `n`.
3. **Next Iteration Check**: For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `j` is currently `n-2`, the next value of `j` will be `n-1`.
4. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` remains unchanged at `n-1`.
   - `j` will be incremented to `n-1`.
   - The condition `j < n` will be checked, and since `n-1` is equal to `n-1`, the loop will not continue because it will not satisfy `j < n`.

However, if we assume the loop is intended to run until `j` reaches `n-1` (as implied by the range), then:

- `j` needs to be adjusted to `n-1`.
- `i` remains `n-1`.

### Final State for the Start of the Next Iteration
- `n` remains the same (positive integer).
- `lig[n-1]` remains the same (original value of `lig[n-1]` plus `T[n-1][n-2]`).
- `i` remains `n-1`.
- `j` is now `n-1`.

So, the final state is:

**`n` is a positive integer; `lig[n-1]` is the original value of `lig[n-1]` plus `T[n-1][n-2]`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `n-1`**.

State: **`n` is a positive integer; `lig[n-1]` is the original value of `lig[n-1]` plus `T[n-1][n-2]`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `n-1`**.
