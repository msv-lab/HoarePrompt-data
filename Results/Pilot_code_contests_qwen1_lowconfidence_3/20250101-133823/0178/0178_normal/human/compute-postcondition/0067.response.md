According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `col[i]` is an element of the list `col`.
- `lig[j]` is an element of the list `lig`.
- If `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`, `compt` is increased by 1. However, since the else part is not applicable, no changes occurred during the previous iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `j` is incremented at each iteration and we don't know its exact value at the end of the previous iteration, we only know it needs to be less than `n`.

Given this, we adjust the state as follows:
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `col[i]` remains an element of the list `col`.
- `lig[j]` becomes the next element in the list `lig`.

So, the new state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `col[i]` is an element of the list `col`, `lig[j+1]` is an element of the list `lig`**
