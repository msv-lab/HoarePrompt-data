State before the loop starts: `loop` is `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `loop` is equal to `n`, but this alone does not guarantee that the loop will execute unless `n` is greater than 0.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `n` must be greater than 0. This means that `loop` (which is `n`) must also be greater than 0.

State: **`loop` (which is `n`) must be greater than 0**
