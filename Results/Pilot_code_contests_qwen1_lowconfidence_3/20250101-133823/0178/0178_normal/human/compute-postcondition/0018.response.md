Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `lig[i]` is the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[i]` starting from index 0 up to index `n-1`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The for loop is defined as:
   ```
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**: In each iteration of the loop, the variable `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` should be less than `n`.

4. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**: After the previous iteration:
   - `i` would have been equal to `n-1` (since it starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`).

5. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Hence, `i` needs to be incremented to `n` (the next integer value).

6. **Updated States**:
   - `i` will be updated to `n`.
   - `lig[i]` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`, which is `n`.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[n]` starting from index 0 up to index `n-1`, `i` is `n`**.
