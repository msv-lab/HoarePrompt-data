Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `compt` is the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig` plus 1 if `col[n-1]` is greater than `lig[0]`, otherwise `compt` remains unchanged.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `compt` is incremented by 1 if `col[i] > lig[j]` is true, otherwise `compt` remains unchanged.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n-1`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - To move to the next iteration, `j` must increment by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `n`.

### Adjusted States:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `j` will be updated to `n`.
- Since the loop condition checks `j < n`, `compt` does not change unless the loop body modifies it, but based on the given information, no such modification is specified.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `j` is `n`.
- `compt` remains unchanged.

### Answer:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `n`, and `compt` remains unchanged.**
