The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a list of n strings. Each string represents a row of the n x n board and contains n space-separated integers. Each integer on the board is within the range [1, 100], and n is within the range [1, 30]. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list of n strings representing an n x n board with each cell containing an integer in the range [1, 100].

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter which is a list of n strings, each string representing a row of an n x n board with n space-separated integers in the range [1, 100].**
