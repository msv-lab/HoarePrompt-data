According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[n]` starting from index 0 up to index `n-1`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is `n-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently `n`, the loop condition `i < n` is not satisfied.

To satisfy the loop condition, `i` must be decreased by 1. Therefore, `i` should be set to `n-1`.

Additionally, since `j` is derived from `i` (specifically, `j = n - 1`), it does not need to be changed as long as `i` is updated correctly.

The new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `lig[n]` remains the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[n]` starting from index 0 up to index `n-1`.
- `i` is now `n-1`.
- `j` remains `n-1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[n]` starting from index 0 up to index `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `n-1`**
