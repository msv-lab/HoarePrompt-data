The code updates `lig[i]` by adding the value of `T[i][j]` to it. Given the initial state, we know:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` is `n-1`
- `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[n]` starting from index 0 up to index `n-1`

Therefore, the line of code `lig[i] += T[i][j]` translates to:
- `lig[n-1] += T[n-1][n-1]`

Since `i` and `j` are both `n-1`, the value being added to `lig[n-1]` is `T[n-1][n-1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[n]` starting from index 0 up to index `n-1`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `n-1`; `lig[n-1]` is updated to its original value plus `T[n-1][n-1]`**
