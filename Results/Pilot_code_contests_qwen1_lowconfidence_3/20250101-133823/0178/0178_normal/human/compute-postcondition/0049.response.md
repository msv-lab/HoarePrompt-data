Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `col[0]` is its original value plus `T[1][0]`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - `i` is `0`.
   - `j` is `1`.
   - `col[1:n]` is unchanged.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `j` starts from `0` and goes up to `n-1`, the loop can execute one more time if `j` is still within this range.
   - Currently, `j` is `1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be `2`.
   - No other state variables are directly affected by the loop incrementing `j`.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `col[0]` remains the same as it was in the previous state.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `lig[i]` remains the same as it was in the previous state.
   - `i` remains `0`.
   - `j` is now `2`.
   - `col[1:n]` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`col[0]` is its original value plus `T[1][0]`, `n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `2`, and `col[1:n]` is unchanged**.
