The code snippet `lig[i] += T[i][j]` impacts the `lig` list by adding the value of `T[i][j]` to the existing value of `lig[i]`. However, the initial state and values of `lig` and `T` are not explicitly defined in the provided information, except that `n` must be greater than 0. Since the exact values of `i`, `j`, and the contents of `lig` and `T` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `lig[i]`. But we know that `lig[i]` has been updated to its original value plus `T[i][j]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `lig[i]` is updated to its original value plus `T[i][j]`**
