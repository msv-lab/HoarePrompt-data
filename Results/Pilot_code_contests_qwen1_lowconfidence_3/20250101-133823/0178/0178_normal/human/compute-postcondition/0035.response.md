The code initializes a list `col` with `n` elements, each set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `lig[i]`, `i`, or `j`. Therefore, the values of `n`, `lig[i]`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `col` is a list of `n` zeros.**
