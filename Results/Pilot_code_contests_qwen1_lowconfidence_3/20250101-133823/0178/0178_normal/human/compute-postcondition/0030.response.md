The code `lig[i] += T[i][j]` updates the value of `lig[i]` by adding the value of `T[i][j]` to it. Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `lig[n]` is the sum of its original value and all elements in the sublist `T[n]` starting from index 0 up to index `n-1`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` is `n-2`

We know that:
- `i = n - 1`
- `j = n - 2`

So, the code becomes `lig[i] += T[i][j]` which translates to `lig[n-1] += T[n-1][n-2]`.

Therefore, the value of `lig[n-1]` is updated by adding the value of `T[n-1][n-2]` to it.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `lig[n-1]` is the original value of `lig[n-1]` plus `T[n-1][n-2]`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `n-2`**
