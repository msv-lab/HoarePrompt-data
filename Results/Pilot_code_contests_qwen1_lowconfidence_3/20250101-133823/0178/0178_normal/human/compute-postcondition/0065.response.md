`compt` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions state that `n` must be greater than 0, `col[i]` is an element of the list `col`, `lig[j]` is an element of the list `lig`, and the current value of `col[i]` is greater than the current value of `lig[j]`. These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `col[i]` is an element of the list `col`, `lig[j]` is an element of the list `lig`, and the current value of `col[i]` is greater than the current value of `lig[j]`; `compt` is increased by 1**
