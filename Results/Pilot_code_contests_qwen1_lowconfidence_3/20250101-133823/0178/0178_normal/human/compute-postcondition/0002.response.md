State before the loop starts: `T` is a 2D list of size n x n, with all elements initialized to 0.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The for loop iterates over a range from 0 to n-1.
2. The loop variable `loop` will take values from 0 up to n-1 during each iteration.
3. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since the range function in Python is inclusive of the start value but exclusive of the stop value).

Therefore, the initial state needs to ensure that `n` is greater than 0. The other variables (`T`) are already correctly initialized, and no adjustments are needed for them since they do not affect the loop's execution condition.

State: **`T` is a 2D list of size n x n, with all elements initialized to 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
