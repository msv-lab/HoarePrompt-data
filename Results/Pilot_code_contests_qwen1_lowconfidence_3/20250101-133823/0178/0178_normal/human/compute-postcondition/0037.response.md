Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `col` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - `i` must be less than `n`.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range `range(n)`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `j` must be in the range `[0, n)`.

3. **Current State of Variables:**
   - `j` is currently `n-1`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `j` is currently `n-1`, the loop will execute once (as `j` will iterate from `0` to `n-1`).
   - However, to ensure the loop can execute without any issues, we need to confirm that the loop condition is met initially.
   - The initial value of `j` as `n-1` should be valid for the loop to start.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - We need to ensure that `j` is in the range `[0, n)`. Given that `j` is currently `n-1`, it satisfies this condition.
   - There is no need to adjust the value of `j` further because it is already set correctly.

6. **Additional Considerations:**
   - `i` is set to `n`, but the loop condition does not depend on `i`. Therefore, there is no need to adjust `i`.
   - `col` being a list of `n` zeros is fine and does not affect the loop execution.
   - `lig[i]` being the sum of sublists is also fine and does not affect the loop execution.

Therefore, the final state after considering the loop execution is:

**State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `col` is a list of `n` zeros, `j` must be in the range `[0, n)`**.
