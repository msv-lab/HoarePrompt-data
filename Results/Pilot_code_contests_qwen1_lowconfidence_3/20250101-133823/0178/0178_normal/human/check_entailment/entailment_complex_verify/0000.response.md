Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated version clearly shows that the program calculates the sum of each row and each column correctly. However, the comparison inside the innermost loop is incorrect. The program currently compares `col[i]` (the sum of the ith column) with `lig[j]` (the sum of the jth row), which does not meet the requirement of the problem description. Instead, it should compare `col[i]` with `lig[i]` (the sum of the ith row) to determine if the ith column is a winning column. Since the current implementation does not perform this correct comparison, the program does not meet the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment remains correct.
