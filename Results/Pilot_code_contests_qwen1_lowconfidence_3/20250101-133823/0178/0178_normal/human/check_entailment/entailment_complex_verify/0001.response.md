Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code, it is clear that the program does not correctly implement the logic for determining winning squares. Specifically, the program compares the sum of the entire column with the sum of the entire row, rather than the sum of the column with the sum of the corresponding row (i.e., the row that contains the current square). 

The original assessment correctly identifies this issue. In the annotated version, the state of the program shows that `lig[i]` contains the sum of the entire i-th row, and `col[i]` contains the sum of the i-th column. When the program checks `if col[i] > lig[j]`, it is comparing the column sum with the row sum of a different row `lig[j]` instead of the corresponding row `T[i]`.

The corrected version of the program should dynamically calculate the row sum and column sum for each square being checked. This is demonstrated in the corrected code provided in the analysis section. Since the original program does not perform this dynamic calculation, it fails to correctly identify the winning squares according to the problem description.
