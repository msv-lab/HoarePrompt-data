You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson played some game on a checkered board n × n in size. During the game they put numbers on the board's squares by some tricky rules we don't know. However, the game is now over and each square of the board contains exactly one number. To understand who has won, they need to count the number of winning squares. To determine if the particular square is winning you should do the following. Calculate the sum of all numbers on the squares that share this column (including the given square) and separately calculate the sum of all numbers on the squares that share this row (including the given square). A square is considered winning if the sum of the column numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the row numbers.

<image>

For instance, lets game was ended like is shown in the picture. Then the purple cell is winning, because the sum of its column numbers equals 8 + 3 + 6 + 7 = 24, sum of its row numbers equals 9 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 19, and 24 > 19.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30). Each of the following n lines contain n space-separated integers. The j-th number on the i-th line represents the number on the square that belongs to the j-th column and the i-th row on the board. All number on the board are integers from 1 to 100.

Output

Print the single number — the number of the winning squares.

Program:

def func():
    n = int(input())
    T = [[0 for loop in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
    for loop in range(n):
        T[loop] = list(map(int, raw_input().split(' ')))
    lig = [0 for loop in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            lig[i] += T[i][j]
    col = [0 for loop in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            col[i] += T[j][i]
    compt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if col[i] > lig[j]:
                compt += 1
    print(compt)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the sums for the columns and rows as required by the problem description. Specifically, the program calculates the sum of elements in the ith row for the `lig` list and the sum of elements in the jth column for the `col` list. However, it then compares `col[i]` (the sum of the ith column) with `lig[j]` (the sum of the jth row), which is incorrect according to the problem statement. Instead, it should compare `col[i]` with `lig[i]`.

To fix this, the comparison inside the innermost loop should be `if col[i] > lig[i]:`. This ensures that the sum of the column is compared with the sum of the corresponding row, meeting the requirement of the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is provided as a list of n strings, where each string represents a row of the n x n board and contains n space-separated integers. Each integer on the board is within the range [1, 100], and n is within the range [1, 30].
def func():
    n = int(input())
    T = [[(0) for loop in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
    for loop in range(n):
        T[loop] = list(map(int, raw_input().split(' ')))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `T` is a 2D list of size `n x n`, where each row `T[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is a list of integers read from user input, and all other elements in `T` remain 0; `loop` is `n`.
    lig = [(0) for loop in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            lig[i] += T[i][j]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`.
    col = [(0) for loop in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            col[i] += T[j][i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, `col` is a list of `n` integers where each element `col[i]` is the sum of the `i`-th column of matrix `T` up to the `n-1` row.
    compt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if col[i] > lig[j]:
                compt += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig`, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `n`.
    print(compt)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an n x n board represented as a list of n strings, where each string contains n space-separated integers. It calculates the sum of each row and each column and then counts how many column sums are greater than any row sum. The function returns the count of such columns. If the input is valid (i.e., n is within [1, 30] and each string contains exactly n integers in the range [1, 100]), the function correctly computes the required count. However, if the input format is incorrect (e.g., wrong number of integers per row or out-of-range values), the function will raise an error since it relies on `int(input())` and `map(int, raw_input().split(' '))`. There are no explicit checks for these edge cases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
