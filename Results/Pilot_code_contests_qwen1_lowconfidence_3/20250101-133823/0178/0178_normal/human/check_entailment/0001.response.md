Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining winning squares. Specifically, the program compares the sum of the column with the sum of the row for each square, but it should compare the sum of the column with the sum of the corresponding row (i.e., the row that contains the current square).

In the given program, `lig[i]` contains the sum of the entire i-th row, while `col[i]` contains the sum of the i-th column. When comparing these sums, the program should be checking if the column sum is greater than the row sum for the specific square (T[j][i]), not the entire row sum.

To fix this, the program should compute the row sum and column sum dynamically for each square being checked. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    T = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        T[i] = list(map(int, input().split()))

    compt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            row_sum = sum(T[i])
            col_sum = sum(T[k][j] for k in range(n))
            if col_sum > row_sum:
                compt += 1

    print(compt)
```

This corrected version dynamically calculates the row sum and column sum for each square and correctly checks if the column sum is greater than the row sum.
