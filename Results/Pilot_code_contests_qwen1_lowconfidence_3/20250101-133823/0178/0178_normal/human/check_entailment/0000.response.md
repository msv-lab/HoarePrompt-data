Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the sums for the columns and rows as required by the problem description. Specifically, the program calculates the sum of elements in the ith row for the `lig` list and the sum of elements in the jth column for the `col` list. However, it then compares `col[i]` (the sum of the ith column) with `lig[j]` (the sum of the jth row), which is incorrect according to the problem statement. Instead, it should compare `col[i]` with `lig[i]`.

To fix this, the comparison inside the innermost loop should be `if col[i] > lig[i]:`. This ensures that the sum of the column is compared with the sum of the corresponding row, meeting the requirement of the problem description.
