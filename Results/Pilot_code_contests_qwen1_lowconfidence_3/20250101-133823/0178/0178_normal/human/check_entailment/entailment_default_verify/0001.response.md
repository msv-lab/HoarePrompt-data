Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining winning squares. Specifically, the program compares the sum of the column with the sum of the row for each square, but it should compare the sum of the column with the sum of the corresponding row (i.e., the row that contains the current square). 

The corrected version dynamically calculates the row sum and column sum for each square and correctly checks if the column sum is greater than the row sum. The original program uses pre-calculated row sums (`lig`) and column sums (`col`), which leads to incorrect comparisons. Since the original program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, the final assessment remains **False**.
