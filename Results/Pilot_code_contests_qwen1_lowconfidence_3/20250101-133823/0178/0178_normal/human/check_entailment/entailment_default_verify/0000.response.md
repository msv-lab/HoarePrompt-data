Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. Specifically, the comparison inside the inner loop is between `col[i]` and `lig[j]`, which should be `col[i]` and `lig[i]` to ensure that the sum of the column is compared with the sum of the corresponding row. The output hints confirm that the program relies on valid input formats and assumes that the input is always within the specified constraints. Therefore, without fixing the comparison logic, the program will not correctly determine the number of winning squares.
