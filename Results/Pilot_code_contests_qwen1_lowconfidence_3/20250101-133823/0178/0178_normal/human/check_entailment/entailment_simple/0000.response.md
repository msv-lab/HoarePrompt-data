Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the size of the board (1 ≤ n ≤ 30).
   - It then reads `n` rows of `n` space-separated integers and stores them in a 2D list `T`. This part matches the problem description where each row of the board is represented by a list of integers.

2. **Row Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum of each row and stores these sums in the list `lig`. Specifically, for each row `i`, it sums all the elements in `T[i]` and stores this sum in `lig[i]`. This step ensures that `lig[i]` contains the sum of all numbers in the `i`-th row.

3. **Column Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum of each column and stores these sums in the list `col`. Specifically, for each column `i`, it sums all the elements in `T[j][i]` (where `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`) and stores this sum in `col[i]`. This step ensures that `col[i]` contains the sum of all numbers in the `i`-th column.

4. **Winning Square Count**:
   - The program iterates through each cell `(i, j)` of the board and checks if the sum of the column containing this cell (`col[i]`) is strictly greater than the sum of the row containing this cell (`lig[j]`). If so, it increments the counter `compt`.
   - Finally, it prints the count of such cells, which represents the number of winning squares.

### Verification:
- The program correctly calculates the required sums for each row and column.
- It accurately compares these sums for each cell and counts the number of cells that meet the condition.
- The logic is implemented step-by-step and aligns with the problem description.

Given that the program follows the steps outlined in the problem description without any discrepancies, the program is correct. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
