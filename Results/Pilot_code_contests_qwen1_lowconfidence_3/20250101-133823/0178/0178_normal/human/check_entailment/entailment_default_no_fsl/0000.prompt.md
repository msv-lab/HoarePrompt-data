You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson played some game on a checkered board n × n in size. During the game they put numbers on the board's squares by some tricky rules we don't know. However, the game is now over and each square of the board contains exactly one number. To understand who has won, they need to count the number of winning squares. To determine if the particular square is winning you should do the following. Calculate the sum of all numbers on the squares that share this column (including the given square) and separately calculate the sum of all numbers on the squares that share this row (including the given square). A square is considered winning if the sum of the column numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the row numbers.

<image>

For instance, lets game was ended like is shown in the picture. Then the purple cell is winning, because the sum of its column numbers equals 8 + 3 + 6 + 7 = 24, sum of its row numbers equals 9 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 19, and 24 > 19.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30). Each of the following n lines contain n space-separated integers. The j-th number on the i-th line represents the number on the square that belongs to the j-th column and the i-th row on the board. All number on the board are integers from 1 to 100.

Output

Print the single number — the number of the winning squares.

In the first example two upper squares are winning.

In the third example three left squares in the both middle rows are winning:
    
    
    5 7 8 4  
    9 5 3 2  
    1 6 6 4  
    9 5 7 3  
    
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    T = [[0 for loop in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
    for loop in range(n):
        T[loop] = list(map(int, raw_input().split(' ')))
    lig = [0 for loop in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            lig[i] += T[i][j]
    col = [0 for loop in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            col[i] += T[j][i]
    compt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if col[i] > lig[j]:
                compt += 1
    print(compt)


```
Output hints: The function processes an n x n board represented as a list of n strings, where each string contains n space-separated integers. It calculates the sum of each row and each column and then counts how many column sums are greater than any row sum. The function returns the count of such columns. If the input is valid (i.e., n is within [1, 30] and each string contains exactly n integers in the range [1, 100]), the function correctly computes the required count. However, if the input format is incorrect (e.g., wrong number of integers per row or out-of-range values), the function will raise an error since it relies on `int(input())` and `map(int, raw_input().split(' '))`. There are no explicit checks for these edge cases.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
