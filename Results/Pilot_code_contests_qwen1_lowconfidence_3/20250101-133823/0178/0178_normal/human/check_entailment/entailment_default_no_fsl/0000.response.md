Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the code calculates the sum of each column and each row, but it incorrectly compares the column sums with the row sums. According to the problem description, a square is winning if the sum of its column numbers is strictly greater than the sum of its row numbers. However, the code compares each column sum with every row sum, which is not what the problem requires.

To fix this, the code should compare the column sum of a specific square with the row sum of the same square, not with every row sum. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    T = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        T[i] = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    column_sums = [sum(row) for row in T]
    row_sums = [sum(T[i]) for i in range(n)]
    
    winning_count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if column_sums[j] > row_sums[i]:
                winning_count += 1
    
    print(winning_count)
```

This corrected version ensures that each column sum is compared only with the corresponding row sum, adhering to the problem description.
