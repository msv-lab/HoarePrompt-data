Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the program incorrectly compares the sum of the column with the sum of the entire row, rather than the sum of the row that contains the specific square being checked. This is evident from the annotation stating that `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, which means it sums the entire row, not just the row containing the current square. The corrected version dynamically calculates the row sum and column sum for each square, which is necessary to accurately determine if the square is winning. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being incorrect is supported by the annotated version.
