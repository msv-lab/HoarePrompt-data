Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The issue lies in the comparison logic within the nested loops where the program compares `col[i]` with `lig[j]` instead of `lig[i]`. According to the problem description, a square is considered winning if the sum of the column numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the row numbers. Therefore, the correct comparison should be `if col[i] > lig[i]:`. The annotated version of the code supports this, showing that `lig[i]` is the sum of the elements in the ith row, and `col[i]` is the sum of the elements in the ith column. Since the provided code does not perform this correct comparison, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Thus, the original assessment is correct.
