Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code sums the columns and rows correctly but then compares each column sum to each row sum individually, rather than comparing the column sum of a specific square to the corresponding row sum. This results in counting too many squares as winning.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2
1 2
3 4
```

The code would count both squares as winning because it compares each column sum to each row sum, even though the correct logic should only compare the sum of the column containing the square to the sum of the row containing the square.

To fix this, the code should compare the sum of the column containing the square to the sum of the row containing the square, not every column sum to every row sum. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    T = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    for loop in range(n):
        T[loop] = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    row_sums = [sum(row) for row in T]
    col_sums = [sum(col) for col in zip(*T)]
    
    compt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if col_sums[j] > row_sums[i]:
                compt += 1
                
    print(compt)
```

This corrected version ensures that the column sum and row sum are compared for the specific square being evaluated, thereby correctly identifying winning squares.
