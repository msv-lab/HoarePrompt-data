Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` representing the size of the board and then reads `n` lines of space-separated integers to populate the `n x n` board matrix `T`.

2. **Row and Column Sums Calculation**: 
   - The program initializes a list `lig` to store the sum of each row.
   - It then iterates through the board to compute the sum of each row and stores these sums in `lig`.
   - Similarly, it initializes a list `col` to store the sum of each column.
   - It then iterates through the board to compute the sum of each column and stores these sums in `col`.

3. **Winning Squares Counting**:
   - The program initializes a counter `compt` to zero.
   - It iterates through each element of the board again and checks if the sum of the column containing the element (`col[i]`) is greater than the sum of the row containing the element (`lig[j]`).
   - If the condition is met, it increments the counter `compt`.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the value of `compt`, which is the number of winning squares.

Since the program correctly calculates the sums of the rows and columns and counts the number of winning squares based on the comparison of these sums, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
