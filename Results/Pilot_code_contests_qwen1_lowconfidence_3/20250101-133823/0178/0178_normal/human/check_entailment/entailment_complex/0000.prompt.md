You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson played some game on a checkered board n × n in size. During the game they put numbers on the board's squares by some tricky rules we don't know. However, the game is now over and each square of the board contains exactly one number. To understand who has won, they need to count the number of winning squares. To determine if the particular square is winning you should do the following. Calculate the sum of all numbers on the squares that share this column (including the given square) and separately calculate the sum of all numbers on the squares that share this row (including the given square). A square is considered winning if the sum of the column numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the row numbers.

<image>

For instance, lets game was ended like is shown in the picture. Then the purple cell is winning, because the sum of its column numbers equals 8 + 3 + 6 + 7 = 24, sum of its row numbers equals 9 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 19, and 24 > 19.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30). Each of the following n lines contain n space-separated integers. The j-th number on the i-th line represents the number on the square that belongs to the j-th column and the i-th row on the board. All number on the board are integers from 1 to 100.

Output

Print the single number — the number of the winning squares.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is provided as a list of n strings, where each string represents a row of the n x n board and contains n space-separated integers. Each integer on the board is within the range [1, 100], and n is within the range [1, 30].
def func():
    n = int(input())
    T = [[(0) for loop in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
    for loop in range(n):
        T[loop] = list(map(int, raw_input().split(' ')))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `T` is a 2D list of size `n x n`, where each row `T[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is a list of integers read from user input, and all other elements in `T` remain 0; `loop` is `n`.
    lig = [(0) for loop in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            lig[i] += T[i][j]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`.
    col = [(0) for loop in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            col[i] += T[j][i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the sublist `T[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, `col` is a list of `n` integers where each element `col[i]` is the sum of the `i`-th column of matrix `T` up to the `n-1` row.
    compt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if col[i] > lig[j]:
                compt += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `col` that are greater than any corresponding element in `lig`, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `n`.
    print(compt)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an n x n board represented as a list of n strings, where each string contains n space-separated integers. It calculates the sum of each row and each column and then counts how many column sums are greater than any row sum. The function returns the count of such columns. If the input is valid (i.e., n is within [1, 30] and each string contains exactly n integers in the range [1, 100]), the function correctly computes the required count. However, if the input format is incorrect (e.g., wrong number of integers per row or out-of-range values), the function will raise an error since it relies on `int(input())` and `map(int, raw_input().split(' '))`. There are no explicit checks for these edge cases.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
