The function `func_7` accepts an integer `n` as input, where \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\). It then computes and returns a list `l` containing all unique divisors of `n`, including 1 and `n` itself. The function iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n` to find divisors, ensuring that each divisor is added only once to the list. This is achieved by checking if `n` is divisible by the current number `i` and adding both `i` and `n // i` to the list if they are not already present. If `i` is equal to `n // i`, it means `n` is a perfect square, and `i` should be added only once. The function handles the case where `n` is 1, returning `[1]` since 1 is its only divisor.
