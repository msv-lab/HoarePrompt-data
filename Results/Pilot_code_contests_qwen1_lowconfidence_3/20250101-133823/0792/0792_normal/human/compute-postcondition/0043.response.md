The code appends the value of `p` to the list `f`. Given the initial conditions:

- `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are marked as `True`.
- `p` is an integer such that `2 ≤ p + 1 < n`.
- `f` is a list containing `[p + 1, p + 1]` if `prime[p + 1]` is `True`, otherwise `f` is a list containing `[p + 1]`.

If `prime[p + 1]` is `True`, `f` is initially `[p + 1, p + 1]`. After appending `p` to `f`, the list `f` becomes `[p + 1, p + 1, p]`.

If `prime[p + 1]` is `False`, `f` is initially `[p + 1]`. After appending `p` to `f`, the list `f` becomes `[p + 1, p]`.

Therefore, the output state depends on the condition of `prime[p + 1]`:

- If `prime[p + 1]` is `True`: `f` becomes `[p + 1, p + 1, p]`.
- If `prime[p + 1]` is `False`: `f` becomes `[p + 1, p]`.

Output State: **`prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are marked as `True`; `p` is an integer such that `2 ≤ p + 1 < n`; if `prime[p + 1]` is `True`, `f` is `[p + 1, p + 1, p]`, otherwise `f` is `[p + 1, p]`.**
