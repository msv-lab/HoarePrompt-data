Postcondition: ***`prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are marked as `True`; `p` is an integer such that `2 â‰¤ p + 1 < n`; `f` is a list containing `[p + 1, p + 1, p]` if `prime[p + 1]` is `True`, otherwise `f` is `[p + 1, p]`.***
