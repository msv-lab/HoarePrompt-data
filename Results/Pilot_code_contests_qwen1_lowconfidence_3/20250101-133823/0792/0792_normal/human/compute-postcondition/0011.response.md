Postcondition: ***`prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are still `True`. `p` is the smallest prime number that has not been processed yet and is set to 2. If `prime[p]` is `True`, then `i` is set to `p * p` and increments by `p` in each iteration. Since there is no else part, no additional changes occur if `prime[p]` is not `True`.***
