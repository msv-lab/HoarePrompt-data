Postcondition: ***`prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are marked as `True`, `p` is an integer such that 2 ≤ p ≤ n, and `f` is a list containing `[p]` if `prime[p]` is `True`, otherwise `f` remains an empty list.***
