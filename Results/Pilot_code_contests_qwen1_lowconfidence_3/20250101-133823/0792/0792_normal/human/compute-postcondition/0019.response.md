`prime[i]` is assigned the value `False`. Given that `i` is 15, `prime[15]` is set to `False`. The values of the other variables (`prime[12]`, `p`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `prime[12]` is `False`, `p` is 3, `n` must be greater than 9, `i` is 15, `prime[15]` is `False`.

Output State: **`prime[12]` is `False`, `p` is 3, `n` must be greater than 9, `i` is 15, `prime[15]` is `False`**
