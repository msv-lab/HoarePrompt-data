The value of `p` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, `p` was the largest prime number less than or equal to `n` plus 2, and if `prime[p]` is `True`, it indicates that `p` is not a prime number. After incrementing `p` by 1, the new value of `p` is the original value of `p` plus 1. The state of the list `prime` and the value of `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are `True`; `p` is the original value of `p` plus 1, and if `prime[p]` is `True`, it means `p` is not a prime number.**
