Functionality: **The function `func_8` accepts an integer `n` representing the upper limit for generating prime numbers. It initializes a list `prime` of boolean values, where each index represents whether the corresponding number is prime (marked as `False`) or not (marked as `True`). It then iterates through the list, marking multiples of each found prime number as non-prime. After the loop, it creates a list `f` containing all the prime numbers less than or equal to `n` by iterating through the `prime` list and appending indices where the value is still `True`. Finally, it returns the list `f` containing all prime numbers up to `n`. Potential edge cases include when `n` is less than 2, in which case no primes are generated, and when `n` is exactly 2, in which case the list contains only the number 2. The function correctly handles these cases by marking 2 as the first prime and stopping the loop when necessary.**
