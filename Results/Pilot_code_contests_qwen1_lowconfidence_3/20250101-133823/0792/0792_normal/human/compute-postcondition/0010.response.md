Output State: **`prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are still `True`, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 4`, `p` is the smallest prime number that has not been processed yet and is set to 2, `i` is initially set to `p * p` and increments by `p` in each iteration.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial Values:** The list `prime` is initialized to all `True` for indices from `0` to `n`. The variable `p` starts at `2` and is incremented as the loop progresses.
- **Loop Operation:** The loop iterates over multiples of `p` starting from `p * p` up to `n`. For each multiple `i`, `prime[i]` is set to `False`. This process marks the multiples of `p` as non-prime.
- **Termination Condition:** The loop continues until there are no more multiples of the current `p` within the range `[p * p, n]`.

### Key Points:
1. **Prime Marking:** All numbers that are multiples of `p` (starting from `p * p`) are marked as `False` in the `prime` list. This effectively marks these numbers as non-prime.
2. **Next Prime:** Once all multiples of the current `p` are marked, `p` is incremented to the next smallest unmarked prime number. This process repeats until all primes up to `n` are identified.
3. **Final State:** After all iterations, the `prime` list will have `True` for all prime numbers up to `n` and `False` for all composite numbers. The value of `p` will be the largest prime number found or `n + 1` if no more primes are left to mark.

This ensures that the `prime` list correctly identifies all prime numbers up to `n`.
