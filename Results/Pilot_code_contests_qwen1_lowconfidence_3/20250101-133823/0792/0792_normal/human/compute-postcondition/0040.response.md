The code appends the value of `p` to the list `f`. Given the initial conditions:

- `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are marked as `True`.
- `p` is an integer such that `2 ≤ p < n`.
- `f` is a list containing `[p]` if `prime[p]` is `True`, otherwise `f` remains an empty list.

If `prime[p]` is `True`, then `f` contains `[p]` before the code runs. After running the code, `p` is appended to `f`, making `f` equal to `[p, p]`.

If `prime[p]` is `False`, then `f` is an empty list before the code runs. After running the code, `p` is appended to `f`, making `f` equal to `[p]`.

In both cases, the value of `prime` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are marked as `True`; `p` is an integer such that `2 ≤ p < n`; `f` is a list containing `[p, p]` if `prime[p]` is `True`, otherwise `f` is a list containing `[p]`.**
