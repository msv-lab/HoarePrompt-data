`prime[i]` is set to `False`. Given that `i` is `p * p + 2 * p`, this means that the element in the `prime` list at index `p * p + 2 * p` is now marked as `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are `True`, except the element at index `p * p + p` which is `False`, the element at index `p * p + 2 * p` is `False`, `i` is `p * p + 2 * p`, `n` is at least 9, `p * p` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`**
