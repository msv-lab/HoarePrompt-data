Postcondition: ***`prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are still `True`. `p` is the largest prime number less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`, and `n` is at least 9. If `prime[p]` is `True`, then `p` is the largest prime number less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`. If `prime[p]` is `False`, no change occurs to `p`.***
