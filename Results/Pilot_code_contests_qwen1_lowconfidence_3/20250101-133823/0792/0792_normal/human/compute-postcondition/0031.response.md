Postcondition: ***`prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are `True`. `p` is the largest prime number less than or equal to `n` plus 2, and if `p` is not a prime number (i.e., `prime[p]` is `True`), the function continues as specified. Since there is no else part provided, if `prime[p]` is `True`, it means `p` is not a prime number, and the list remains unchanged for `p`.***
