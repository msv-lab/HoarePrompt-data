The code `p += 1` increments the value of `p` by 1. Given the initial state where `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` marking prime numbers as `False` and non-prime numbers as `True`, and `p` is the largest prime number less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`, the value of `p` is updated by adding 1. The conditions for `prime[p]` being `True` or `False` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are still `True`; `p` is the original largest prime number plus 1; `n` is at least 9.**
