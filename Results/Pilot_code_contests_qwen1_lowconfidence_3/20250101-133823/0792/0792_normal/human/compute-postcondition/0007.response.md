The code `prime[i] = False` sets the element at index `i` in the list `prime` to `False`. Given the initial state where `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `True` except for `prime[k + 2]` which is now `False`, and considering that `i` is `k + 2`, the element `prime[i]` is already `False`. Setting it to `False` again does not change its value.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the exception that the value of `prime[i]` is explicitly stated to be `False`.

Output State: **`prime` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `True` except for `prime[k + 2]` which is now `False`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `p` is 2, `i` is `k + 2`, `prime[i]` is `False`**
