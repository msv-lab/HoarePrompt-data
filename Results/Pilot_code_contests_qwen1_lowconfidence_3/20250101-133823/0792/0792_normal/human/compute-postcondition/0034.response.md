The code initializes an empty list `f`. The initial state of `prime` and `p` remains unchanged since the code does not modify these variables. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the empty list `f`.

Output State: **`prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are marked as `True`; `p` is the next integer greater than the square root of `n` and the final value of `p` is `n + 1` if `n` is a prime number, otherwise it is the smallest integer greater than the largest prime number found during the execution of the loop; `f` is an empty list**
