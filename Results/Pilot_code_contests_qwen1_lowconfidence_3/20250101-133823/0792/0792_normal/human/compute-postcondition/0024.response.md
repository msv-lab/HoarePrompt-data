To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the information given and the requirements for the loop to start executing.

### Given Information:
- `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are still `True`.
- `p` is the original largest prime number plus 2.
- `n` is at least 9.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(p * p, n + 1, p):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - The variable `i` is being set to values starting from `p * p` up to `n + 1` (exclusive) with a step of `p`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, the starting value of `i` (which is `p * p`) should be within the range `[p * p, n + 1)` and `i` should increment by `p` until it exceeds `n + 1`.

3. **Ensuring `p * p` is Within Range:**
   - Since `i` starts at `p * p`, `p * p` must be less than or equal to `n + 1` for the loop to start. This means `p * p <= n + 1`.

4. **Ensuring `p` is Correct:**
   - `p` is defined as the original largest prime number plus 2. We don't need to adjust `p` itself since its value is derived from an external condition and is already set correctly based on the initial conditions provided.

5. **List `prime`:**
   - The list `prime` is already initialized as specified, so no changes are needed here.

6. **Value of `n`:**
   - It is given that `n` is at least 9. This ensures that the upper limit of the range is valid for the loop.

### Conclusion:
- The main concern is ensuring that `p * p` is within the range `[p * p, n + 1)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `p * p` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.

### Final State Adjustment:
- The initial state should be adjusted to ensure that `p * p` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is not relevant, `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are still `True`, `p` is the original largest prime number plus 2, `n` is at least 9, `p * p` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`**.
