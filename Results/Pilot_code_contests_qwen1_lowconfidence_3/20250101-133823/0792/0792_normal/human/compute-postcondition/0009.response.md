The code `prime[i] = False` sets the value of `prime[i]` to `False`. From the initial state, we know that `prime[k + 2]` is already `False`, and `prime[i]` is `False` where `i` is `k + 4`. Since the line of code does not change the value of `prime[k + 2]` (it remains `False`), and only changes the value of `prime[i]` to `False`, the value of `prime[i]` is now explicitly stated to be `False`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `True` except for `prime[k + 2]` which is `False` and `prime[i]` which is `False` (where `i` is `k + 4`).

Output State: **`prime` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `True` except for `prime[k + 2]` which is `False` and `prime[i]` which is `False` (where `i` is `k + 4`).**
