Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are still `True`.
  - `p` is 3.

- The loop condition is:
  ```
  while p * p <= n:
  ```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `p * p <= n`.
2. **Current Value of `p`**: `p` is currently 3.
3. **Next Iteration Check**: For the loop to continue, the next check in the loop will be whether `p * p` is still less than or equal to `n`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Current `p` Value**: `p` is 3.
2. **Next `p` Value**: In the next iteration, `p` would be incremented (assuming it is incremented inside the loop).
3. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `p * p` must still be less than or equal to `n`.

Given that `p` is currently 3, we need to determine the minimum value of `n` such that the loop can continue.

- If `p = 3`, then `p * p = 9`.
- Therefore, for the loop to continue, `9` must be less than or equal to `n`.

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be at least 9.

### Final Answer
State: **`prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are still `True`; `p` is 3; `n` must be at least 9.**
