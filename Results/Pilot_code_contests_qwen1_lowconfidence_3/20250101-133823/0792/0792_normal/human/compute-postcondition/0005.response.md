`prime[i]` is assigned the value `False`. Based on the initial conditions, `prime[i]` was `True` before this assignment. The value of `i` is updated to `p * p` and then incremented by `p` in each iteration. Since `prime[i]` is now `False`, the output state should reflect this change while keeping the other conditions unchanged.

Output State: **`prime` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `True` except for `prime[i]` which is now `False`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `p` is 2, `i` is initially set to `p * p`, and `i` increments by `p` in each iteration.**
