The code appends the value of `p` to the list `f`. Initially, `f` is an empty list, so after appending `p`, `f` will contain `[p]`. The values of `prime` and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are marked as `True`, `p` is an integer such that 2 ≤ p ≤ n, `f` is now a list containing `[p]`.

Output State: **`prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are marked as `True`, `p` is an integer such that 2 ≤ p ≤ n, `f` is a list containing `[p]`**
