The code snippet `prime[i] = False` changes the value of `prime[i]` to `False`. Given the initial state, `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are `True`. After executing this line of code, the element at index `i` in the list `prime` will be set to `False`. 

The other variables (`total`, `p`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are `True`, except the element at index `i` which is now `False`, `p` is the original largest prime number plus 2, `n` is at least 9, `p * p` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`**.
