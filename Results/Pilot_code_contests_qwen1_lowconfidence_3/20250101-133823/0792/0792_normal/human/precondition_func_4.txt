None of the variables in the function `func_5` are documented or used within its body. The function simply reads an integer input from the standard input and returns it as is. However, based on the problem description, it seems that this function is not directly related to solving the main problem but might be part of a larger solution where it is expected to provide the values of n, m, k, and the sequence p1, p2, ..., pn.
