The function `func_5` reads an integer input from the standard input and returns it. There are no additional actions or transformations performed on the input value. Potential edge cases include the input being non-integer or the input stream being closed before the function can read anything. If the input is not a valid integer, the function will raise a `ValueError`. No other preconditions or postconditions are enforced by the function itself.
