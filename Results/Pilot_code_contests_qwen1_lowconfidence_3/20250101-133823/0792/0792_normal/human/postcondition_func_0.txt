The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `p`, where `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `p` is an integer such that \(3 \leq p \leq 10^9\). It computes and returns \(n^{p-2} \mod p\). The function uses the `pow` function to perform the modular exponentiation efficiently. The returned value is the result of \(n\) raised to the power of \(p-2\) modulo \(p\). No additional edge cases or missing functionality are noted in the provided code.
