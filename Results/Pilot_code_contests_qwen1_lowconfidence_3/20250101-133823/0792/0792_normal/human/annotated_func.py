#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, and p is an integer such that 3 <= p <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, p):
    return pow(n, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns \( n^{p-2} \mod p \) where \( n \) is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \) and \( p \) is an integer such that \( 3 \leq p \leq 10^9 \)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `p`, where `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `p` is an integer such that \(3 \leq p \leq 10^9\). It computes and returns \(n^{p-2} \mod p\). The function uses the `pow` function to perform the modular exponentiation efficiently. The returned value is the result of \(n\) raised to the power of \(p-2\) modulo \(p\). No additional edge cases or missing functionality are noted in the provided code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables (n, m, k, and the sequence p) are explicitly passed as arguments to the function `func_2`. However, based on the problem description and typical function usage, we can infer the following:
def func_2():
    return map(int, func_4().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers converted from a string split by spaces, where the string comes from the output of func_4()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes no explicit input parameters and returns a map object containing integers. These integers are derived from a string obtained by splitting the output of another function `func_4()` using spaces as delimiters. The function does not handle any potential errors that might occur during the conversion of the split string into integers or if `func_4()` returns an empty or non-string value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: func_4() returns a string containing space-separated integers representing the sequence p1, p2, ..., pn, where n, m, and k are also integers satisfying the conditions provided in the problem description.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_4().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from a string containing space-separated integers provided by func_4()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` takes no explicit inputs and returns a list of integers. It achieves this by calling `func_4()`, which returns a string containing space-separated integers. `func_3()` then splits this string into a list of substrings, converts each substring to an integer using `map(int, ...)`, and finally returns this list of integers. There are no specified edge cases or missing functionality within the given code snippet, assuming `func_4()` always returns a valid string with space-separated integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters, which implies it does not directly contribute to solving the main problem described. However, based on the problem context, the function might be part of a larger solution and is expected to read input in the form of strings, which need to be converted to appropriate data types (integers in this case) to proceed with the logic.
def func_4():
    return input()
    #The program returns a string that needs to be converted to an appropriate data type (integer) to proceed with the logic
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` reads input from the user and returns it as a string. After the function concludes, the program has a string value that needs to be converted to an appropriate data type (integer) to proceed with the logic. There are no parameters passed to the function, and it does not modify any external state. Potential edge cases include the user entering non-numeric input, in which case the subsequent conversion to an integer will fail unless handled separately.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_5` are documented or used within its body. The function simply reads an integer input from the standard input and returns it as is. However, based on the problem description, it seems that this function is not directly related to solving the main problem but might be part of a larger solution where it is expected to provide the values of n, m, k, and the sequence p1, p2, ..., pn.
def func_5():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input read from the standard input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reads an integer input from the standard input and returns it. There are no additional actions or transformations performed on the input value. Potential edge cases include the input being non-integer or the input stream being closed before the function can read anything. If the input is not a valid integer, the function will raise a `ValueError`. No other preconditions or postconditions are enforced by the function itself.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers, and both x and y are non-negative after taking their absolute values. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of x and y is returned.
def func_6(x, y):
    x = abs(x)
    y = abs(y)
    if (min(x, y) == 0) :
        return max(x, y)
        #The program returns the maximum value between x and y, where both x and y are non-negative integers and the minimum of x and y is 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is the absolute value of `y` (which is `y` since `y` is already non-negative), and the minimum of `x` and `y` is not equal to 0
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the last non-zero remainder when the original `x` is successively divided by the original `y`, and `y` is 0.
    return x
    #The program returns x which is the last non-zero remainder when the original x is successively divided by the original y, and y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It first takes the absolute values of `x` and `y`. If the minimum of `x` and `y` is 0, it returns the maximum value between `x` and `y`. Otherwise, it computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm and returns the result. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, unless the minimum of `x` and `y` is 0, in which case it returns the maximum value between `x` and `y`. This covers all potential edge cases and ensures that the function behaves correctly in all scenarios.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the product of m and k, where 1 ≤ (m × k) ≤ n ≤ 5000, and the function does not use the variables m or k from the main problem context.
def func_7(n):
    l = []
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)):
        if n % i == 0:
            if n // i == i:
                l.append(i)
            else:
                l.append(i)
                l.append(n // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `l` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` (including 1 and `n` itself).
    return l
    #`The program returns a list 'l' containing all unique divisors of `n`, including 1 and `n` itself, where `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts an integer `n` as input, where \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\). It then computes and returns a list `l` containing all unique divisors of `n`, including 1 and `n` itself. The function iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n` to find divisors, ensuring that each divisor is added only once to the list. This is achieved by checking if `n` is divisible by the current number `i` and adding both `i` and `n // i` to the list if they are not already present. If `i` is equal to `n // i`, it means `n` is a perfect square, and `i` should be added only once. The function handles the case where `n` is 1, returning `[1]` since 1 is its only divisor.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the upper limit for generating prime numbers, and the function does not depend on the values or indices of the input sequence p1, p2, ..., pn provided in the main problem description.
def func_8(n):
    prime = [(True) for i in range(n + 1)]
    p = 2
    while p * p <= n:
        if prime[p] == True:
            for i in range(p * p, n + 1, p):
                prime[i] = False
        
        p += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are marked as `True`; `p` is the next integer greater than the square root of `n` and the final value of `p` is `n + 1` if `n` is a prime number, otherwise it is the smallest integer greater than the largest prime number found during the execution of the loop.
    f = []
    for p in range(2, n):
        if prime[p]:
            f.append(p)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` are marked as `False` and all non-prime numbers are marked as `True`, `p` is the smallest integer greater than the largest prime number found during the execution of the loop and `f` is a list containing all prime numbers less than or equal to `n`.
    return f
    #The program returns the list 'f' containing all prime numbers less than or equal to 'n'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts an integer `n` representing the upper limit for generating prime numbers. It initializes a list `prime` of boolean values, where each index represents whether the corresponding number is prime (marked as `False`) or not (marked as `True`). It then iterates through the list, marking multiples of each found prime number as non-prime. After the loop, it creates a list `f` containing all the prime numbers less than or equal to `n` by iterating through the `prime` list and appending indices where the value is still `True`. Finally, it returns the list `f` containing all prime numbers up to `n`. Potential edge cases include when `n` is less than 2, in which case no primes are generated, and when `n` is exactly 2, in which case the list contains only the number 2. The function correctly handles these cases by marking 2 as the first prime and stopping the loop when necessary.
