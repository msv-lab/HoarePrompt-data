The function `func_2` takes no explicit input parameters and returns a map object containing integers. These integers are derived from a string obtained by splitting the output of another function `func_4()` using spaces as delimiters. The function does not handle any potential errors that might occur during the conversion of the split string into integers or if `func_4()` returns an empty or non-string value.
