The function `func_4()` reads input from the user and returns it as a string. After the function concludes, the program has a string value that needs to be converted to an appropriate data type (integer) to proceed with the logic. There are no parameters passed to the function, and it does not modify any external state. Potential edge cases include the user entering non-numeric input, in which case the subsequent conversion to an integer will fail unless handled separately.
