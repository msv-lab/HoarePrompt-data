Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is the original value minus `div` if the condition `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] >= div` is true and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block, otherwise it remains unchanged, `div` is the integer division of `len(group)` by `k`, `rem` is `len(group) % k`, and `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - (number_of_iterations - 1)` is greater than or equal to `-1`, with no further operations performed outside the if-else block.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs in reverse order starting from `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` down to `0`.
- For each iteration, if the frequency of the current character (`string.ascii_lowercase[i]`) is greater than or equal to `div`, the frequency is decreased by `div`, and the loop breaks.
- If the condition is not met for any character in the range, the function `func_3('No')` is called, and the function returns, meaning the loop does not execute at all.

Since the loop executes in reverse order and checks characters from the beginning of the alphabet, after all iterations, the frequency of characters in `freq` will be adjusted based on the `div` value only if the condition is satisfied. If the loop does not execute at all, the frequencies remain unchanged, and the values of `div` and `rem` are still as per the initial state.
