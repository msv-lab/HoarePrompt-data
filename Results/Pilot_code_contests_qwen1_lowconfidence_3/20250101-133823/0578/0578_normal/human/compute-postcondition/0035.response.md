Postcondition: ***`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `freq` has been updated based on the previous `group`, `div` is the integer division of `len(group)` by `k`, `rem` is `len(group) % k`. If `freq[group[0]] < rem`, then the postcondition does not change. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
