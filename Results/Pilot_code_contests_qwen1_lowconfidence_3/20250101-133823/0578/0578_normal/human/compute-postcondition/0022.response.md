Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty iterable, and the standard output buffer is flushed if the `flush` keyword argument is `True`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
