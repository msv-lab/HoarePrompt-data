To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and the given output states step by step.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over the characters of `group` in reverse order, starting from the character at index `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` down to 0. It checks if the frequency of each character is greater than or equal to `div`. If so, it subtracts `div` from the frequency of that character and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it calls `func_3('No')` and returns.

### Key Points
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues until `div` becomes 0.
2. **Frequency Update**: Each time the loop executes, it updates the frequency of a character by subtracting either `div` or `rem` based on the condition.
3. **Break Condition**: The loop breaks if the condition `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] >= div` is met.

### Given Output States
- **After 1 iteration**:
  - `groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`.
  - `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is its previous value minus either `div` or `rem`.
  - `div` remains unchanged.
  - `rem` is now `len(group) % k`.
  - `number_of_iterations` is incremented by 1.
  - `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - number_of_iterations` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
  - `freq[group[0]]` is its previous value minus `rem`.

- **After 2 iterations**:
  - Similar to the first iteration, but `number_of_iterations` is incremented by 1 more.

- **After 3 iterations**:
  - Similar to the first and second iterations, but `number_of_iterations` is 2.

### Conclusion
Since the loop continues to execute as long as `div` is not 0, the final state will be when `div` becomes 0. At this point, the loop will terminate without performing any further updates to the frequencies.

### Final Output State
- `groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`.
- `div` becomes 0.
- `rem` is the final remainder after the last iteration, which is `len(group) % k`.
- `number_of_iterations` is the total number of iterations performed.
- `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - number_of_iterations` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
- `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is its previous value minus either `div` or `rem` depending on the condition during each iteration.

### Output State
Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `div` is 0, `rem` is the final remainder after the last iteration, `number_of_iterations` is the total number of iterations performed, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - number_of_iterations` is greater than or equal to `-1`, and `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is its previous value minus either `div` or `rem` depending on the condition during each iteration.**
