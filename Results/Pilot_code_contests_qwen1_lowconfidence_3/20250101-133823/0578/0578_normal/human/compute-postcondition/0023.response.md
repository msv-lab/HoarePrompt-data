The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters directly. It only mentions `t`, `n`, `k`, `sep`, `file`, and `end` in its description, but these are associated with the `print` function rather than being parameters of `func_3`. The function also does not explicitly return anything based on the given information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to call the `print` function without any parameters, using the provided `sep`, `file`, and `end` arguments if they are specified, but not returning any value.

Functionality: **The function `func_3` calls the `print` function with no parameters, utilizing `sep`, `file`, and `end` if provided, but does not return any value.**
