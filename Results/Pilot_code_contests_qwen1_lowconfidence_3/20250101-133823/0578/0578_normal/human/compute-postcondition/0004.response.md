Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `x` is the initial value of `y`
- `y` is `x % y`

### Loop Condition:
```python
while y:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values and Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `while y:`. This means the loop continues as long as `y` is non-zero.
   - From the given state, we know `y` is set to `x % y`. For `y` to be non-zero, `x % y` should be non-zero, implying that `y` (the remainder) is non-zero only if `x` is not exactly divisible by `y`.

2. **Ensuring the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `y` must be non-zero at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since `y` is defined as `x % y`, `y` will be non-zero if `x` is not exactly divisible by `y` in the current iteration.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that the next iteration starts with `y` being non-zero.

### Adjusted State:
- We need to ensure that `y` is non-zero at the start of the next iteration. Given that `y` is `x % y`, the next `y` value will be non-zero if the current `y` is non-zero.
- Thus, no additional state adjustment is necessary beyond ensuring `y` is non-zero at the start of the next iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`x` is the initial value of `y` and `y` is `x % y` (with `y` being non-zero)**
