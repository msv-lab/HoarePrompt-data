The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead exits the current loop or conditional block. Given that the initial state includes the variables `groups`, `freq`, `div`, `rem`, `number_of_iterations`, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - number_of_iterations`, `freq[group[0]]`, and `i`, the values of these variables remain unchanged after the `break` statement is executed.

Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is its previous value minus `div`, `div` remains unchanged, `rem` is now `len(group) % k`, `number_of_iterations` is incremented by 1, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - number_of_iterations` is greater than or equal to `-1`, `freq[group[0]]` is its previous value minus `rem`, and `i` must be greater than or equal to `-1`. We break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.**
