Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`.
   - `div` remains unchanged.
   - `rem` is now `len(group) % k`.
   - `number_of_iterations` is incremented by 1.
   - `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - (number_of_iterations + 1)` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is its previous value minus `div`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` down to `i = 0`.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be a valid index within the range specified.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - After each iteration of the loop, `i` decreases by 1.
   - The condition `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - (number_of_iterations + 1)` must remain greater than or equal to `-1` for the loop to continue.

Given these points, let's determine the new state:

- Since `i` starts at `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` and decreases by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` becomes `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2`.
- The condition `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - (number_of_iterations + 1)` must still hold true. After the first iteration, `number_of_iterations` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `2`.

Thus, the new condition is:
\[ \text{string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])} - (2 + 1) \geq -1 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ \text{string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])} - 3 \geq -1 \]
Which is:
\[ \text{string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])} \geq 2 \]

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `div` remains unchanged, `rem` is now `len(group) % k`, `number_of_iterations` is incremented by 1 to 2, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 3` is greater than or equal to `-1`, and `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is its previous value minus `div`.**
