Postcondition: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` remains unchanged, `div` remains unchanged, `rem` is now `len(group) % k`, `number_of_iterations` is incremented by 1, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - number_of_iterations` is greater than or equal to `-1`, `freq[group[0]]` is its previous value minus `rem`, and `i` must be greater than or equal to `-1`. Additionally, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is greater than or equal to `div`.**
