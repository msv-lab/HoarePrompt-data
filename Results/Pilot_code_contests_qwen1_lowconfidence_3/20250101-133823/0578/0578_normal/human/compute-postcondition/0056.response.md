The function `func_3('No')` is called, but the definition of `func_3` is not provided. Since no specific changes to the variables are mentioned in the code snippet, the only updates given are:

- `rem` is now `len(group) % k`
- `number_of_iterations` is incremented by 1
- `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - number_of_iterations` is greater than or equal to `-1`

However, without knowing the exact behavior of `func_3`, we cannot determine how `groups`, `freq`, `div`, or `group` are affected. The only variables explicitly updated are `rem`, `number_of_iterations`, and the condition involving `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])`.

Therefore, the output state includes the updated variables and the unchanged preconditions:

Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` remains unchanged, `div` remains unchanged, `rem` is now `len(group) % k`, `number_of_iterations` is incremented by 1, and `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - number_of_iterations` is greater than or equal to `-1`**
