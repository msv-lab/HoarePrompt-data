The function `func_3('No')` is called with the argument 'No'. However, the definition of `func_3` is not provided in the initial state or the code snippet. Since `func_3` is not defined, we cannot determine what changes it might make to the variables. The only thing we know is that the function is called with the argument 'No', and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `group[0]` is the first substring in `groups`, `freq` has been updated based on the previous `group`, `div` is the integer division of `len(group)` by `k`, `rem` is `len(group) % k`, `func_3` is called with the argument 'No'**
