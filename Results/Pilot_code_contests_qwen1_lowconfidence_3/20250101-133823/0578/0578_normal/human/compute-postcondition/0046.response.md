The code `break` does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is inside. Since there is no explicit loop or conditional statement in the given code snippet, the only effect is that we break out of the innermost loop or conditional statement we were inside.

Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is the original value minus `div`, `div` is the integer division of `len(group)` by `k`, `rem` is `len(group) % k`, and `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2` is greater than or equal to `-1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
