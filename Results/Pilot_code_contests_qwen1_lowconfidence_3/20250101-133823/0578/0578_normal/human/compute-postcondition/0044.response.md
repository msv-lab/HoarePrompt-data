Let's analyze the given situation step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`.
   - `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is either the original value minus `div` (if the condition `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] >= div` is true and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block) or remains unchanged (if the condition is false).
   - `div` is the integer division of `len(group)` by `k`.
   - `rem` is `len(group) % k`.
   - `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - No further operations are performed outside the if-else block.

2. **Loop Context**:
   - The for loop iterates over `i` from `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` down to `-1`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `i` in the specified range, the loop body is executed. However, the specific details of the loop body are omitted.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over a decreasing range starting from `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` and ending at `-1`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - Given that `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` is initially greater than or equal to `-1`, `i` will start from this value and decrease until it reaches `-1`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than `-1`. Since `i` starts from `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` and decreases by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` before the loop would be `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2`.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `groups` remains the same since no operations affecting `groups` are mentioned.
- `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` remains as it is unless the condition inside the loop is met.
- `div` and `rem` remain unchanged since they are not part of the loop and no operations affecting them are mentioned.
- `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` remains greater than or equal to `-1`.

State: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is either the original value minus `div` (if the condition `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] >= div` is true and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block) or remains unchanged (if the condition is false), `div` is the integer division of `len(group)` by `k`, `rem` is `len(group) % k`, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2` is greater than or equal to `-1`, and no further operations are performed outside the if-else block.**
