The function `func_3('Yes')` is called, but the details of this function are not provided in the initial state or within the given code snippet. Without knowing what `func_3` does, we cannot determine how the variables are affected. The only information we have is about the initial state of the variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is the original value minus `div` if the condition `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] >= div` is true and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block, otherwise it remains unchanged, `div` is 0, `rem` is the final remainder after the last iteration, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - number_of_iterations` is greater than or equal to `-1`, and `number_of_iterations` is the total number of iterations performed.**
