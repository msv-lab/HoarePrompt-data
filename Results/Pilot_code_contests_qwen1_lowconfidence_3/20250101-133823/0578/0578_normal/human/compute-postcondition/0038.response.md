Postcondition: ***`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `freq[group[0]]` is updated to `freq[group[0]] - rem`, `div` is the integer division of `len(group)` by `k`, and `rem` is `len(group) % k`. If `div == 0`, no further changes are made. Otherwise, the conditions remain as they are after the if statement execution.***
