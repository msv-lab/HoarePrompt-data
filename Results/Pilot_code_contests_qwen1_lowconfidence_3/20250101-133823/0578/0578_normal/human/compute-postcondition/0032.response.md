The code calculates the remainder when the length of `group` is divided by `k` and assigns this remainder to `rem`. The length of `group` is stored in `len(group)`, which means the value of `rem` is `len(group) % k`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `group[0]` is the first substring in `groups`, `freq` has been updated based on the previous `group`, `div` is the integer division of `len(group)` by `k`, `rem` is `len(group) % k`.**
