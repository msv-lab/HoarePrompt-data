Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial State:
- `groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`.
- `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` remains unchanged.
- `div` remains unchanged.
- `rem` is now `len(group) % k`.
- `number_of_iterations` is incremented by 1.
- `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - number_of_iterations` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
- `freq[group[0]]` is its previous value minus `rem`.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**:
   - The loop runs from `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` to `-1` (inclusive).
   - This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is within this range.

2. **Initial Value of `i`**:
   - The initial value of `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - To ensure the loop can start, `i` must be initialized such that the loop condition is satisfied.
   - Given that `i` starts at `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`, we need to ensure that `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

5. **Additional Considerations**:
   - The state of `group[0]` and `rem` should remain consistent for the loop to execute correctly.
   - `freq[group[0]]` should reflect the updated value after the decrement.
   - `div` and `number_of_iterations` should remain unchanged as specified.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`.
- `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` remains unchanged.
- `div` remains unchanged.
- `rem` is now `len(group) % k`.
- `number_of_iterations` is incremented by 1.
- `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - number_of_iterations` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
- `freq[group[0]]` is its previous value minus `rem`.
- `i` must be initialized such that `i >= -1`.

### State:
**`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` remains unchanged, `div` remains unchanged, `rem` is now `len(group) % k`, `number_of_iterations` is incremented by 1, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - number_of_iterations` is greater than or equal to `-1`, `freq[group[0]]` is its previous value minus `rem`, and `i` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.**
