The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` impacts the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the key `'end'` with its default value `\n` and writing this value to `file`. The initial state of `kwargs` is empty (`args` is an empty iterable), so popping `'end'` from an empty dictionary will not remove any items but will simply return `None`.

Since `file` is `sys.stdout`, the value `\n` (newline character) is written to the standard output. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty iterable; a newline character is written to `sys.stdout`.**
