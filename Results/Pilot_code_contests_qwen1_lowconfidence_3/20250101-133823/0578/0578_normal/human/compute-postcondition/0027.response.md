The code `break` does not affect the variables `groups`, `group[0]`, or `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]`. It simply breaks out of the loop or the most internal loop or if statement it is within. Since no variables are modified, the only change is that we break out of the loop or the most internal if statement we were in.

Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `group[0]` is a valid lowercase letter, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
