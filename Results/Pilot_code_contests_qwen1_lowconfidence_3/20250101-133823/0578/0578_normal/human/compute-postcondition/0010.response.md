Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\); `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\); `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\); `sep` is `' '`; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` is a non-empty iterable (with at least one element left); `sys.stdout` contains three space-separated elements, regardless of whether the `if` condition is met or not.***
