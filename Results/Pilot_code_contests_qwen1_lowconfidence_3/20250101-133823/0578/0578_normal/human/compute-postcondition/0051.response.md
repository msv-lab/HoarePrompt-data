Postcondition: ***`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, and for the substring `group` at index `i`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is the original value minus `div`. `div` is the integer division of `len(group)` by `k`, and `rem` is `len(group) % k`. `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2` is greater than or equal to `-1`, with `i` being `i_end_prev - 1`.***
