Postcondition: ***`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `div` remains unchanged, `rem` is now `len(group) % k`, `number_of_iterations` is incremented by 1, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - (number_of_iterations + 1)` is greater than or equal to `-1`, and `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is its previous value minus `div`. If `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is greater than or equal to `div`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
