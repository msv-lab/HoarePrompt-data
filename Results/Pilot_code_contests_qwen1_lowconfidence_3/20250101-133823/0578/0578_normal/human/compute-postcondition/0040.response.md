Postcondition: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `freq[group[0]]` is updated to `freq[group[0]] - rem`, `div` is the integer division of `len(group)` by `k`, `rem` is `len(group) % k`, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` is greater than or equal to `-1`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is greater than or equal to `div`**
