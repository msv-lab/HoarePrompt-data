The function `func_4` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are non-negative integers. The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y`, and sets `y` to 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, compute their GCD, and return the GCD while setting `y` to 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both non-negative integers, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`, setting `y` to 0.**
