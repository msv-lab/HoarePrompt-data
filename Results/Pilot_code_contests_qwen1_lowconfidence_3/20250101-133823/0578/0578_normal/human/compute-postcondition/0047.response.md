Postcondition: ***`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is either the original value minus `div` (if the condition `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] >= div` is true and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block) or remains unchanged (if the condition is false), `div` is the integer division of `len(group)` by `k`, `rem` is `len(group) % k`, and `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2` is greater than or equal to `-1`, with no further operations performed outside the if-else block.***
