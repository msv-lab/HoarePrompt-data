Postcondition: ***`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is its previous value minus either `div` or `rem`, depending on whether the condition `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] >= div` holds true. `div` remains unchanged, `rem` is now `len(group) % k`, `number_of_iterations` is incremented by 1, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - number_of_iterations` is greater than or equal to `-1`, and `freq[group[0]]` is its previous value minus `rem`. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.***
