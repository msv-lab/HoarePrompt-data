Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes no parameters and returns `None`. It processes two strings, `s` and `t`, and a positive integer `k`. The function first splits an input string into numerical values `n` and `k`, then reads two strings `s` and `t`. It uses a `Counter` object to count the frequency of each character in `s` and identifies substrings in `t` consisting of consecutive identical characters. For each identified substring, it checks if it can be divided into segments of length `k` without violating the character frequency constraints in `s`. If at any point the division is not possible due to insufficient character frequency, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, it continues to check other substrings and eventually returns 'Yes' if all substrings can be divided as required. If the function completes the loop without returning 'No', it returns 'Yes'.

The function handles the following edge cases:
- If the length of any substring in `t` is less than `k`, it immediately returns 'No'.
- If the frequency of the first character in any substring is less than the remainder when dividing the substring length by `k`, it returns 'No'.
- If none of the remaining characters in the alphabet can be used to fill the remaining segments of the substring, it returns 'No'.

Additionally, the function assumes that `t` contains only lowercase English letters and does not handle cases where `t` might contain non-alphabetic characters or special characters.**

This summary covers the core functionality and potential edge cases based on the provided annotated code and return postconditions.
