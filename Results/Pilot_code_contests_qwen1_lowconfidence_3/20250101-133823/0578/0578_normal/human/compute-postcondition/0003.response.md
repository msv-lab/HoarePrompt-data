The initial state is that `x` is the initial value of `y`, and `y` is `x % y`, and `y` must be non-zero. The code swaps the values of `x` and `y` such that `x` becomes `y` and `y` becomes `x % y`.

Given the initial condition `y` is `x % y`, the new value of `x` will be the initial value of `y`, and the new value of `y` will be `x % y` (which is already defined in the initial state).

So, the new values are:
- `x` becomes the initial value of `y`
- `y` remains `x % y`

Output State: **`x` is the initial value of `y`; `y` is `x % y`**
