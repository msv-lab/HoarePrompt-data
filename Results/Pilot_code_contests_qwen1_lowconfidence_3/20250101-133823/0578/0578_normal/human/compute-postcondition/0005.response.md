In the initial state, `x` is the initial value of `y` and `y` is `x % y` (with `y` being non-zero). The given code swaps the values of `x` and `y` using the formula `x, y = y, x % y`.

Let's denote the initial value of `y` as `y_initial`. Since `x` is the initial value of `y`, we can say `x = y_initial`. And since `y` is `x % y`, we have `y = x_initial % y_initial`.

After executing the code `x, y = y, x % y`, the new value of `x` will be the initial value of `y` (`y_initial`), and the new value of `y` will be `x % y`, which is `y_initial % y_initial`. Since any number modulo itself is 0, `y` will be 0.

Output State: **`x` is `y_initial`, `y` is 0**
