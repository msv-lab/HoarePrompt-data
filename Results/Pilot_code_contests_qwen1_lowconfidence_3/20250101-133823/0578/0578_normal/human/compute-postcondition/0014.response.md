`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to `file`. Since `sep` is `' '`, this operation will write a space character to `file`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is the next element from `args`, `args` is a non-empty iterable with one less element, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, a space character has been written to `file`.**
