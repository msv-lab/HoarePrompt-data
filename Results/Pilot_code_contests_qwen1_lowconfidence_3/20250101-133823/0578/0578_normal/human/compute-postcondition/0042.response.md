The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not affect the values of the variables listed in the initial state since there is no loop or conditional block that would be exited by this statement. Therefore, the values of `groups`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]`, `div`, `rem`, and the condition related to `group[0]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is the original value minus `div`, `div` is the integer division of `len(group)` by `k`, `rem` is `len(group) % k`, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` is greater than or equal to `-1`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is greater than or equal to `0`. We break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.**
