Postcondition: ***`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `div` remains unchanged, `rem` is now `len(group) % k`, `number_of_iterations` is 2, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 3` is greater than or equal to `-1`, and `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is its previous value minus `div`. If `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is initially greater than or equal to `div`, then the condition is met and the specified operations are performed. If not, no additional changes occur.***
