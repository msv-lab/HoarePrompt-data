The code `freq[group[0]] -= rem` decrements the value of `freq[group[0]]` by `rem`. Given the precondition, `freq[group[0]]` is originally greater than or equal to `rem`. After decrementing, `freq[group[0]]` will be reduced by `rem`.

- The value of `groups`, `t`, `div`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- `freq[group[0]]` is updated to `freq[group[0]] - rem`.
- The condition `if freq[group[0]] < rem` does not change the postcondition if the condition is true (which it would be given the precondition), otherwise, the postcondition remains the same.

Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `freq` has been updated such that `freq[group[0]]` is now `freq[group[0]] - rem`, `div` is the integer division of `len(group)` by `k`, `rem` is `len(group) % k`.**
