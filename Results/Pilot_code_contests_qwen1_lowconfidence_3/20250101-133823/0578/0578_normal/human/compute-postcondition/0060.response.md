The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables, but it does imply that the loop is still ongoing. Given the initial conditions and the fact that no variables are explicitly modified by this statement, the only thing that changes is the continuation of the loop.

Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` remains unchanged, `div` remains unchanged, `rem` is now `len(group) % k`, `number_of_iterations` is incremented by 1, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - number_of_iterations` is greater than or equal to `-1`, and `freq[group[0]]` is its previous value minus `rem`. The loop continues.**
