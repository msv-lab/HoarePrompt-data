The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration without executing the remaining statements in the loop. This means that no changes are made to the variables within the loop body.

Given the initial state:
- `groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`
- `freq[group[0]]` is now `freq[group[0]] - rem`
- `div` is the integer division of `len(group)` by `k`
- `rem` is `len(group) % k`

Since the `continue` statement does not affect any variables and simply skips to the next iteration, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `freq[group[0]]` is now `freq[group[0]] - rem`, `div` is the integer division of `len(group)` by `k`, `rem` is `len(group) % k`.**
