Postcondition: ***`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `group[0]` is a valid lowercase letter, and if `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is greater than or equal to `div`, then `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is reduced by `div`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.***

Explanation: The if part reduces the frequency count by `div` if the current frequency is greater than or equal to `div`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change if the condition in the if statement is not met.
