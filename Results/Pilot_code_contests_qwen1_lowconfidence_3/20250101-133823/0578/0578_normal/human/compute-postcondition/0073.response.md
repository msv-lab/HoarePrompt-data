The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. The values of the variables do not change as a direct result of the `break` statement itself, but the context in which it was used (the loop or if statement) is exited.

Therefore, the Output State is: `groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `div` remains unchanged, `rem` is now `len(group) % k`, `number_of_iterations` is incremented by 1 to 2, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 3` is greater than or equal to `-1`, and `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is its previous value minus `div`.
