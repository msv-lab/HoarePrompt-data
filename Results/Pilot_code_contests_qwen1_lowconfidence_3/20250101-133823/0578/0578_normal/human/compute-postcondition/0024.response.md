Functionality: **The function `func_3` takes a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and prints them to the specified output stream (`file`), using the specified separator (`sep`). If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, it also flushes the output buffer. The function does not return any value. After executing, the standard output (`sys.stdout`) contains a space-separated string of the input arguments, unless the `sep` parameter is set differently. The function also ensures that the `end` parameter is used to terminate the output, which defaults to a newline character if not specified. Potential edge cases include when `args` is empty, or when `sep` and `end` are not provided, in which case their default values are used.**

This summary covers the actual functionality of the code, including all potential edge cases and missing logic implied by the annotations.
