The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is the next element from `args`, `args` is a non-empty iterable with one less element, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `False`.**
