Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is the original value minus `div` if the condition `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] >= div` is true and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block, otherwise it remains unchanged, `div` is 0, `rem` is the final remainder after the last iteration, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - number_of_iterations` is greater than or equal to `-1`, and `number_of_iterations` is the total number of iterations performed.**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization and Loop Structure**:
   - The loop iterates over each `group` in `groups`.
   - For each `group`, it calculates `div` (integer division of `len(group)` by `k`) and `rem` (remainder of `len(group)` divided by `k`).

2. **First Iteration (`number_of_iterations = 1`)**:
   - If `freq[group[0]] < rem`, `func_3('No')` is called, and the function returns.
   - Otherwise, `freq[group[0]]` is reduced by `rem`.
   - If `div` is 0, the loop continues to the next iteration without performing any further operations inside the nested loops.
   - If `div` is not 0, it tries to reduce the frequency of `string.ascii_lowercase[i]` (where `i` is the index of the first character of `group` in `string.ascii_lowercase`) by `div` for each character from `group[0]` to `'a'`.

3. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - The loop continues to iterate over each `group` and perform similar operations.
   - If `div` becomes 0 during any iteration, it skips the inner operations.
   - The `rem` value reduces with each iteration until it reaches 0.

4. **Final State After All Iterations**:
   - Once the loop completes, `div` will be 0 because the length of each group is fully divisible by `k` by the end of the process.
   - The `rem` will be the remainder left after the last division, which is 0 since the loop ensures that all `div` operations are handled.
   - The `freq` dictionary will have updated values based on the reduction rules applied during each iteration.
   - The `groups` list will still exist, but it may or may not contain any substrings depending on the input and the operations performed.

Given these observations, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is as described above.
