Postcondition: ***`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` remains unchanged, `div` remains unchanged, `rem` is now `len(group) % k`, `number_of_iterations` is incremented by 1, and `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - number_of_iterations` is greater than or equal to `-1`. If `freq[group[0]] < rem`, the function returns None. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (i.e., returns `None` implicitly).***
