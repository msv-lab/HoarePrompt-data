Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`.
  - `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is either the original value minus `div` (if the condition `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] >= div` is true and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block) or remains unchanged (if the condition is false).
  - `div` is the integer division of `len(group)` by `k`.
  - `rem` is `len(group) % k`.
  - `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for i in range(string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1, -1, -1):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Understanding the Range of the For Loop:**
   - The loop starts from `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` and goes down to `-1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.
   - This means `i` starts from the index of the first character of `group` minus 1 and decrements until it reaches `-1`.

2. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was set to some value within this range. Let's denote this value as `i_end_prev`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 from its current value.
   - Therefore, `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `i_end_prev - 1`.

4. **Conditions and Variables to Adjust:**
   - Since the loop only decrements `i` and there are no other conditions or operations affecting `i` inside the loop, the only state that needs adjustment is `i`.

### Conclusion
- `i` must be decreased by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- All other variables (`groups`, `freq`, `div`, `rem`, etc.) remain unchanged.

### Final State
State: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is either the original value minus `div` (if the condition `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] >= div` is true and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block) or remains unchanged (if the condition is false), `div` is the integer division of `len(group)` by `k`, `rem` is `len(group) % k`, and `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2` is greater than or equal to `-1`, with `i` being `i_end_prev - 1`**.

(Note: Replace `i_end_prev` with the actual value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.)
