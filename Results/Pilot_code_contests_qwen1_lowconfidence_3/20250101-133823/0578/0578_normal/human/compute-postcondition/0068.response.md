The code `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] -= div` subtracts the value of `div` from `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]`. The initial state specifies that `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is its previous value minus either `div` or `rem`, but after executing this line, it will be further updated by subtracting `div`.

Other variables remain unchanged according to the provided information:
- `div` remains unchanged.
- `rem` is now `len(group) % k`.
- `number_of_iterations` is incremented by 1.
- `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - (number_of_iterations + 1)` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
- `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is its previous value minus `rem` before the current operation.

Therefore, after the execution of the code, the specific changes are:
- `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is now its previous value minus `div` (which was already its previous value minus either `div` or `rem`).

Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `div` remains unchanged, `rem` is now `len(group) % k`, `number_of_iterations` is incremented by 1, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - (number_of_iterations + 1)` is greater than or equal to `-1`, and `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is its previous value minus `div`.**
