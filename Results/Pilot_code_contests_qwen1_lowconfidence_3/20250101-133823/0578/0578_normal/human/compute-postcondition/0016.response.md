`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. This operation does not change the value of `x` or any other variables. The state of `args` remains unchanged as well. Therefore, the only change is in the file, but since we are asked to provide the output state in terms of variables, the values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`x` is the next element from `args`, `args` is a non-empty iterable with one less element, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, and a string representation of `x` has been written to `file`.**
