`freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is reduced by `div`, where `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`. Given the precondition, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` is at least 0, so `i` will be at least -1. However, since `i` is used as an index in `freq`, it should be a non-negative integer. Let's denote `j` as `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`. Therefore, `j` is at least -1, and `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[j]]` is reduced by `div`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings of string `t`, `group[0]` is a valid lowercase letter, and `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is reduced by `div` where `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`, if `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is greater than or equal to `div`; otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.**
