The function `func_4` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. After executing the algorithm, it returns the GCD as the value of `x`, and sets `y` to 0. The function handles the case where either `x` or `y` could be 0 initially, as the GCD of any number with 0 is the number itself. There are no apparent edge cases missed in the provided code, and the function correctly implements the intended behavior.
