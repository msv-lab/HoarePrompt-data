You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ashish has two strings a and b, each of length n, and an integer k. The strings only contain lowercase English letters.

He wants to convert string a into string b by performing some (possibly zero) operations on a.

In one move, he can either 

  * choose an index i (1 ≤ i≤ n-1) and swap a_i and a_{i+1}, or 
  * choose an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n-k+1) and if a_i, a_{i+1}, …, a_{i+k-1} are all equal to some character c (c ≠ 'z'), replace each one with the next character (c+1), that is, 'a' is replaced by 'b', 'b' is replaced by 'c' and so on. 



Note that he can perform any number of operations, and the operations can only be performed on string a. 

Help Ashish determine if it is possible to convert string a into b after performing some (possibly zero) operations on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) — the number of test cases. The description of each test case is as follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n).

The second line of each test case contains the string a of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.

The third line of each test case contains the string b of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n among all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Output

For each test case, print "Yes" if Ashish can convert a into b after some moves, else print "No".

You may print the letters of the answer in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input


4
3 3
abc
bcd
4 2
abba
azza
2 1
zz
aa
6 2
aaabba
ddddcc


Output


No
Yes
No
Yes

Note

In the first test case it can be shown that it is impossible to convert a into b.

In the second test case,

"abba" \xrightarrow{inc} "acca" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "azza".

Here "swap" denotes an operation of the first type, and "inc" denotes an operation of the second type.

In the fourth test case,

"aaabba" \xrightarrow{swap} "aaabab" \xrightarrow{swap} "aaaabb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddaabb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddddbb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddddcc".

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the code does not handle the case where a sequence of characters in `t` needs to be incremented multiple times by the second operation (incrementing consecutive equal characters by 1). Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Increment Operation Handling**: The code attempts to handle the increment operation but does not fully account for sequences that require multiple increments. For example, if the sequence in `t` is `"ddd"` and `k=2`, the code would incorrectly handle this as needing one increment from `'d'` to `'e'` instead of two increments from `'d'` to `'f'`.

2. **Character Frequency Check**: The code checks if the frequency of the initial character in the group is sufficient for the remainder of the group, but it does not properly handle cases where the increment operation needs to be applied multiple times.

3. **Group Iteration Logic**: The code iterates over groups of consecutive identical characters in `t` and tries to decrement the frequency of these characters in `s`. However, it does not ensure that the frequency of characters in `s` can support multiple increments required by the sequence in `t`.

To illustrate with an example:

Consider the following input:
```
3
4 2
abba
azza
6 2
aaabba
ddddcc
2 1
zz
aa
```

For the second test case (`"abba"` to `"azza"` with `k=2`):
- The code attempts to increment the sequence `"bbb"` to `"ccc"` using the second operation.
- However, the code only checks for a single increment and fails to handle the case where the sequence requires multiple increments.

The code will output "No" for this case, which is incorrect because it is possible to convert `"abba"` to `"azza"` by performing the increment operation twice on `"bbb"`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to its inability to handle cases requiring multiple increments in the second operation.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

    func_3('Yes')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no parameters and returns `None`. It processes two strings, `s` and `t`, and a positive integer `k`. The function first splits an input string into numerical values `n` and `k`, then reads two strings `s` and `t`. It uses a `Counter` object to count the frequency of each character in `s` and identifies substrings in `t` consisting of consecutive identical characters. For each identified substring, it checks if it can be divided into segments of length `k` without violating the character frequency constraints in `s`. If at any point the division is not possible due to insufficient character frequency, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, it continues to check other substrings and eventually returns 'Yes' if all substrings can be divided as required. If the function completes the loop without returning 'No', it returns 'Yes'.

The function handles the following edge cases:
- If the length of any substring in `t` is less than `k`, it immediately returns 'No'.
- If the frequency of the first character in any substring is less than the remainder when dividing the substring length by `k`, it returns 'No'.
- If none of the remaining characters in the alphabet can be used to fill the remaining segments of the substring, it returns 'No'.

Additionally, the function assumes that `t` contains only lowercase English letters and does not handle cases where `t` might contain non-alphabetic characters or special characters.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. a and b are strings of length n consisting only of lowercase English letters.
def func_2():
    for _ in range(int(func_5())):
        func_1()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^5\) inclusive, `func_5()` must return a positive integer, `func_1()` has been called a total of `int(func_5())` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of integers `n` and `k` (with constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` consisting only of lowercase English letters. The function calls `func_5()` to determine the number of test cases, then iterates over this number, calling `func_1()` for each iteration. After the loop, `func_1()` has been called a total number of times equal to the value returned by `func_5()`. However, the exact actions performed within `func_1()` are not specified in the provided code. There are no explicit return values mentioned for either `func_5()` or `func_1()`, and the overall state of `a`, `b`, `n`, `k`, and `t` after the function execution is not altered or defined by the given code. Therefore, the function primarily serves as a wrapper that invokes `func_1()` multiple times based on the output of `func_5()`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, sep and file are optional parameters for the `print` function, where sep is a string that separates the arguments when they are written, and file is an object that specifies the output stream, and end is an optional string that is written at the end, defaulting to a newline, and flush is a boolean that, if True, causes the output to be flushed immediately.
def func_3():
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty iterable; `sys.stdout` contains the space-separated string representations of all elements in `args`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty iterable, and the standard output buffer is flushed if the `flush` keyword argument is `True`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and prints them to the specified output stream (`file`), using the specified separator (`sep`). If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, it also flushes the output buffer. The function does not return any value. After executing, the standard output (`sys.stdout`) contains a space-separated string of the input arguments, unless the `sep` parameter is set differently. The function also ensures that the `end` parameter is used to terminate the output, which defaults to a newline character if not specified. Potential edge cases include when `args` is empty, or when `sep` and `end` are not provided, in which case their default values are used.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers.
def func_4(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of x and y, and y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. After executing the algorithm, it returns the GCD as the value of `x`, and sets `y` to 0. The function handles the case where either `x` or `y` could be 0 initially, as the GCD of any number with 0 is the number itself. There are no apparent edge cases missed in the provided code, and the function correctly implements the intended behavior.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and a and b are strings of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
    #t as an integer input from stdin
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from standard input (stdin), representing the number of test cases. After reading `t`, the function does not perform any further operations and simply returns `t`. There are no additional actions or modifications to other variables like `n`, `k`, `a`, or `b`. The function assumes that `t` is a valid integer within the expected range and handles no edge cases beyond ensuring it is an integer.
