You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ashish has two strings a and b, each of length n, and an integer k. The strings only contain lowercase English letters.

He wants to convert string a into string b by performing some (possibly zero) operations on a.

In one move, he can either 

  * choose an index i (1 ≤ i≤ n-1) and swap a_i and a_{i+1}, or 
  * choose an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n-k+1) and if a_i, a_{i+1}, …, a_{i+k-1} are all equal to some character c (c ≠ 'z'), replace each one with the next character (c+1), that is, 'a' is replaced by 'b', 'b' is replaced by 'c' and so on. 



Note that he can perform any number of operations, and the operations can only be performed on string a. 

Help Ashish determine if it is possible to convert string a into b after performing some (possibly zero) operations on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) — the number of test cases. The description of each test case is as follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n).

The second line of each test case contains the string a of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.

The third line of each test case contains the string b of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n among all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Output

For each test case, print "Yes" if Ashish can convert a into b after some moves, else print "No".

You may print the letters of the answer in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input


4
3 3
abc
bcd
4 2
abba
azza
2 1
zz
aa
6 2
aaabba
ddddcc


Output


No
Yes
No
Yes

Note

In the first test case it can be shown that it is impossible to convert a into b.

In the second test case,

"abba" \xrightarrow{inc} "acca" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "azza".

Here "swap" denotes an operation of the first type, and "inc" denotes an operation of the second type.

In the fourth test case,

"aaabba" \xrightarrow{swap} "aaabab" \xrightarrow{swap} "aaaabb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddaabb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddddbb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddddcc".

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the code does not handle the case where a sequence of characters in `t` needs to be incremented multiple times by the second operation (incrementing consecutive equal characters by 1). Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Increment Operation Handling**: The code attempts to handle the increment operation but does not fully account for sequences that require multiple increments. For example, if the sequence in `t` is `"ddd"` and `k=2`, the code would incorrectly handle this as needing one increment from `'d'` to `'e'` instead of two increments from `'d'` to `'f'`.

2. **Character Frequency Check**: The code checks if the frequency of the initial character in the group is sufficient for the remainder of the group, but it does not properly handle cases where the increment operation needs to be applied multiple times.

3. **Group Iteration Logic**: The code iterates over groups of consecutive identical characters in `t` and tries to decrement the frequency of these characters in `s`. However, it does not ensure that the frequency of characters in `s` can support multiple increments required by the sequence in `t`.

To illustrate with an example:

Consider the following input:
```
3
4 2
abba
azza
6 2
aaabba
ddddcc
2 1
zz
aa
```

For the second test case (`"abba"` to `"azza"` with `k=2`):
- The code attempts to increment the sequence `"bbb"` to `"ccc"` using the second operation.
- However, the code only checks for a single increment and fails to handle the case where the sequence requires multiple increments.

The code will output "No" for this case, which is incorrect because it is possible to convert `"abba"` to `"azza"` by performing the increment operation twice on `"bbb"`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to its inability to handle cases requiring multiple increments in the second operation.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 5 : The function reads an integer `t` from standard input (stdin), representing the number of test cases. After reading `t`, the function does not perform any further operations and simply returns `t`. There are no additional actions or modifications to other variables like `n`, `k`, `a`, or `b`. The function assumes that `t` is a valid integer within the expected range and handles no edge cases beyond ensuring it is an integer.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
