Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly handle the logic for swapping adjacent characters and incrementing characters by 1. The current implementation focuses solely on checking the frequency of characters and attempting to divide substrings in `t` based on these frequencies, but it does not actually perform the operations that are necessary to transform `s` into `t`.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

```
3 2
zz
aa
```

According to the problem description, we can perform the following operations:
1. Swap adjacent characters.
2. Increment a sequence of characters by 1 until 'z' is reached.

For the given test case, we need to increment 'z' to 'a'. However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario. The function `func_1` checks the frequency of characters but does not simulate the actual transformations needed to convert `s` into `t`.

The correct approach would involve simulating the operations described in the problem statement, which the current implementation does not do. Therefore, the code is incorrect for this specific case and hence the overall correctness is **False**.
