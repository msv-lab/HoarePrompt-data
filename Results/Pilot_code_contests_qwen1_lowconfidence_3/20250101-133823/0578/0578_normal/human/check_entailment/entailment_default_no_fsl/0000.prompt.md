You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ashish has two strings a and b, each of length n, and an integer k. The strings only contain lowercase English letters.

He wants to convert string a into string b by performing some (possibly zero) operations on a.

In one move, he can either 

  * choose an index i (1 ≤ i≤ n-1) and swap a_i and a_{i+1}, or 
  * choose an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n-k+1) and if a_i, a_{i+1}, …, a_{i+k-1} are all equal to some character c (c ≠ 'z'), replace each one with the next character (c+1), that is, 'a' is replaced by 'b', 'b' is replaced by 'c' and so on. 



Note that he can perform any number of operations, and the operations can only be performed on string a. 

Help Ashish determine if it is possible to convert string a into b after performing some (possibly zero) operations on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) — the number of test cases. The description of each test case is as follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n).

The second line of each test case contains the string a of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.

The third line of each test case contains the string b of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n among all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Output

For each test case, print "Yes" if Ashish can convert a into b after some moves, else print "No".

You may print the letters of the answer in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input


4
3 3
abc
bcd
4 2
abba
azza
2 1
zz
aa
6 2
aaabba
ddddcc


Output


No
Yes
No
Yes

Note

In the first test case it can be shown that it is impossible to convert a into b.

In the second test case,

"abba" \xrightarrow{inc} "acca" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "azza".

Here "swap" denotes an operation of the first type, and "inc" denotes an operation of the second type.

In the fourth test case,

"aaabba" \xrightarrow{swap} "aaabab" \xrightarrow{swap} "aaaabb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddaabb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddddbb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddddcc".

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` takes no parameters and returns `None`. It processes two strings, `s` and `t`, and a positive integer `k`. The function first splits an input string into numerical values `n` and `k`, then reads two strings `s` and `t`. It uses a `Counter` object to count the frequency of each character in `s` and identifies substrings in `t` consisting of consecutive identical characters. For each identified substring, it checks if it can be divided into segments of length `k` without violating the character frequency constraints in `s`. If at any point the division is not possible due to insufficient character frequency, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, it continues to check other substrings and eventually returns 'Yes' if all substrings can be divided as required. If the function completes the loop without returning 'No', it returns 'Yes'.

The function handles the following edge cases:
- If the length of any substring in `t` is less than `k`, it immediately returns 'No'.
- If the frequency of the first character in any substring is less than the remainder when dividing the substring length by `k`, it returns 'No'.
- If none of the remaining characters in the alphabet can be used to fill the remaining segments of the substring, it returns 'No'.

Additionally, the function assumes that `t` contains only lowercase English letters and does not handle cases where `t` might contain non-alphabetic characters or special characters.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    for _ in range(int(func_5())):
        func_1()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of integers `n` and `k` (with constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` consisting only of lowercase English letters. The function calls `func_5()` to determine the number of test cases, then iterates over this number, calling `func_1()` for each iteration. After the loop, `func_1()` has been called a total number of times equal to the value returned by `func_5()`. However, the exact actions performed within `func_1()` are not specified in the provided code. There are no explicit return values mentioned for either `func_5()` or `func_1()`, and the overall state of `a`, `b`, `n`, `k`, and `t` after the function execution is not altered or defined by the given code. Therefore, the function primarily serves as a wrapper that invokes `func_1()` multiple times based on the output of `func_5()`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(*args, **kwargs):
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` takes a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and prints them to the specified output stream (`file`), using the specified separator (`sep`). If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, it also flushes the output buffer. The function does not return any value. After executing, the standard output (`sys.stdout`) contains a space-separated string of the input arguments, unless the `sep` parameter is set differently. The function also ensures that the `end` parameter is used to terminate the output, which defaults to a newline character if not specified. Potential edge cases include when `args` is empty, or when `sep` and `end` are not provided, in which case their default values are used.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. After executing the algorithm, it returns the GCD as the value of `x`, and sets `y` to 0. The function handles the case where either `x` or `y` could be 0 initially, as the GCD of any number with 0 is the number itself. There are no apparent edge cases missed in the provided code, and the function correctly implements the intended behavior.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function reads an integer `t` from standard input (stdin), representing the number of test cases. After reading `t`, the function does not perform any further operations and simply returns `t`. There are no additional actions or modifications to other variables like `n`, `k`, `a`, or `b`. The function assumes that `t` is a valid integer within the expected range and handles no edge cases beyond ensuring it is an integer.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
