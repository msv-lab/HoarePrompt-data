The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, where `a` is a list of integers representing the deliciousness of sardines, and `b` is a list of integers representing the fragrantness of sardines. The function returns the list `b` if the element-wise modulus of `a` by `b` is zero. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and the element-wise modulus of `a` by `b`. 

After the function concludes, if the element-wise modulus condition is met (`a % b == 0`), the function returns the list `b`, which represents the fragrantness of the sardines. If the condition is not met, the function returns the result of the recursive call `func_1(b, a % b)`. This process continues until the modulus condition is satisfied, at which point the original list `b` is returned.
