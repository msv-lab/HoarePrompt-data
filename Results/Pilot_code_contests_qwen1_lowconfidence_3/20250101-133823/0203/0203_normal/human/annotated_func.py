#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where each element represents the deliciousness of a sardine, and b is a list of integers where each element represents the fragrantness of a sardine. The length of both lists is N, and 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, -10^{18} <= A_i, B_i <= 10^{18} for all i.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return b
        #`The program returns the list 'b' where each element represents the fragrantness of a sardine
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: a is a list of integers where each element represents the deliciousness of a sardine, and b is a list of integers where each element represents the fragrantness of a sardine. The length of both lists is N, and 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, -10^{18} <= A_i, B_i <= 10^{18} for all i, and (a % b != 0)
    return func_1(b, a % b)
    #The program returns the result of the function call `func_1(b, a % b)`, where `b` is a list of integers representing the fragrantness of sardines, and `a % b` is the modulus operation applied element-wise between the list `a` (representing the deliciousness of sardines) and the list `b` (representing the fragrantness of sardines)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, where `a` is a list of integers representing the deliciousness of sardines, and `b` is a list of integers representing the fragrantness of sardines. The function returns the list `b` if the element-wise modulus of `a` by `b` is zero. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and the element-wise modulus of `a` by `b`. 

After the function concludes, if the element-wise modulus condition is met (`a % b == 0`), the function returns the list `b`, which represents the fragrantness of the sardines. If the condition is not met, the function returns the result of the recursive call `func_1(b, a % b)`. This process continues until the modulus condition is satisfied, at which point the original list `b` is returned.
