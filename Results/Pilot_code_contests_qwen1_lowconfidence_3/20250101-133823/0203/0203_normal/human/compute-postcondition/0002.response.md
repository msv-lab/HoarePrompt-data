Postcondition: **a is a list of integers where each element represents the deliciousness of a sardine, and b is a list of integers where each element represents the fragrantness of a sardine. The length of both lists is N, and 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, -10^{18} <= A_i, B_i <= 10^{18} for all i, and (a % b != 0)**
