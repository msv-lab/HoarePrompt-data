The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are lists of integers, where each element in `a` represents the deliciousness of a sardine, and each element in `b` represents the fragrantness of a sardine. The length of both lists is `N`, and `1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5`. Additionally, `-10^{18} <= A_i, B_i <= 10^{18}` for all `i`.

The function can return in two cases:
- Case_1: It returns the list `b`, where each element represents the fragrantness of a sardine.
- Case_2: It returns the result of the function call `func_1(b, a % b)`, where `b` is a list of integers representing the fragrantness of sardines, and `a % b` is the modulus operation applied element-wise between the list `a` (representing the deliciousness of sardines) and the list `b` (representing the fragrantness of sardines).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists `a` and `b` and either return the list `b` or the result of calling `func_1` with the lists `b` and `a % b` as arguments, depending on the internal logic of the function. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` is a list of integers representing the deliciousness of sardines, and `b` is a list of integers representing the fragrantness of sardines. It returns the list `b` or the result of the function call `func_1(b, a % b)` based on its internal logic.**
