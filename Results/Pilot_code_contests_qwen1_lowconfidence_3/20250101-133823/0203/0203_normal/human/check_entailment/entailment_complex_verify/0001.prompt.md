You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have caught N sardines. The deliciousness and fragrantness of the i-th sardine is A_i and B_i, respectively.

We will choose one or more of these sardines and put them into a cooler. However, two sardines on bad terms cannot be chosen at the same time.

The i-th and j-th sardines (i \neq j) are on bad terms if and only if A_i \cdot A_j + B_i \cdot B_j = 0.

In how many ways can we choose the set of sardines to put into the cooler? Since the count can be enormous, print it modulo 1000000007.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* -10^{18} \leq A_i, B_i \leq 10^{18}

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where both `A_i` and `B_i` are zero. According to the problem description, if both `A_i` and `B_i` are zero, the sardine is ignored. However, the current implementation does not skip such cases but still increments the count in the dictionary.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of GCD**: The function `func_1` is used to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD). However, this function is not defined within the program. Instead, you should use Python's built-in `math.gcd` function.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Multiples**: The logic for calculating multiples is flawed. Specifically, the lines `d[m1] += 1` and `d[m2] += 0` do not correctly account for all possible pairs of sardines that are on bad terms.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Multiplicity**: The program does not correctly handle the multiplicity of sardines that can be chosen together. It seems to assume that each unique direction vector `(m1, m2)` can be chosen independently, which is not necessarily true.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where each element represents the deliciousness of a sardine, and b is a list of integers where each element represents the fragrantness of a sardine. The length of both lists is N, and 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, -10^{18} <= A_i, B_i <= 10^{18} for all i.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return b
        #`The program returns the list 'b' where each element represents the fragrantness of a sardine
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: a is a list of integers where each element represents the deliciousness of a sardine, and b is a list of integers where each element represents the fragrantness of a sardine. The length of both lists is N, and 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, -10^{18} <= A_i, B_i <= 10^{18} for all i, and (a % b != 0)
    return func_1(b, a % b)
    #The program returns the result of the function call `func_1(b, a % b)`, where `b` is a list of integers representing the fragrantness of sardines, and `a % b` is the modulus operation applied element-wise between the list `a` (representing the deliciousness of sardines) and the list `b` (representing the fragrantness of sardines)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, where `a` is a list of integers representing the deliciousness of sardines, and `b` is a list of integers representing the fragrantness of sardines. The function returns the list `b` if the element-wise modulus of `a` by `b` is zero. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and the element-wise modulus of `a` by `b`. 

After the function concludes, if the element-wise modulus condition is met (`a % b == 0`), the function returns the list `b`, which represents the fragrantness of the sardines. If the condition is not met, the function returns the result of the recursive call `func_1(b, a % b)`. This process continues until the modulus condition is satisfied, at which point the original list `b` is returned.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
