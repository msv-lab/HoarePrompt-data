Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both `A_i` and `B_i` are zero. According to the problem description, such pairs should be ignored. However, the current implementation continues with such pairs, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, consider the input:

```
3
0 0
1 2
-1 1
```

In this case, the pair `(0, 0)` should be ignored, but the program counts it, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
