You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have caught N sardines. The deliciousness and fragrantness of the i-th sardine is A_i and B_i, respectively.

We will choose one or more of these sardines and put them into a cooler. However, two sardines on bad terms cannot be chosen at the same time.

The i-th and j-th sardines (i \neq j) are on bad terms if and only if A_i \cdot A_j + B_i \cdot B_j = 0.

In how many ways can we choose the set of sardines to put into the cooler? Since the count can be enormous, print it modulo 1000000007.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* -10^{18} \leq A_i, B_i \leq 10^{18}

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Program:
```
from collections import defaultdict

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
n = int(raw_input())
ns = []
d = defaultdict(int)
for i in xrange(n):
    (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    ns.append((a, b))
    if a and b:
        s = 1 if a * b >= 0 else -1
        g = func_1(abs(a), abs(b))
        m1 = (s * abs(a) / g, abs(b) / g)
        m2 = (-s * abs(b) / g, abs(a) / g)
    elif a == 0 and b == 0:
        continue
    elif a == 0:
        m1 = (1, 0)
        m2 = (0, 1)
    elif b == 0:
        m1 = (0, 1)
        m2 = (1, 0)
    d[m1] += 1
    d[m2] += 0
pre = 1
for k in d.keys():
    if k[0] < 0:
        assert (k[1], -k[0]) in d
        continue
    elif k[0] == 0:
        pre = pre * d[k] % MOD
    else:
        k1 = k
        k2 = (-k[1], k[0])
        tot = pow(2, d[k1], MOD) + pow(2, d[k2], MOD) - 1
        pre = pre * tot % MOD
print(pre - 1 + MOD) % MOD

def func_1(a, b):
    if a % b == 0:
        return b
    return func_1(b, a % b)

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both `A_i` and `B_i` are zero. According to the problem description, such pairs should be ignored. However, the current implementation continues with such pairs, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, consider the input:

```
3
0 0
1 2
-1 1
```

In this case, the pair `(0, 0)` should be ignored, but the program counts it, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, where `a` is a list of integers representing the deliciousness of sardines, and `b` is a list of integers representing the fragrantness of sardines. The function returns the list `b` if the element-wise modulus of `a` by `b` is zero. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and the element-wise modulus of `a` by `b`. 

After the function concludes, if the element-wise modulus condition is met (`a % b == 0`), the function returns the list `b`, which represents the fragrantness of the sardines. If the condition is not met, the function returns the result of the recursive call `func_1(b, a % b)`. This process continues until the modulus condition is satisfied, at which point the original list `b` is returned.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
