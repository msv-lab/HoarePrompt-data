Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not handle the case where both `A_i` and `B_i` are zero. According to the problem description, such pairs should be ignored. The provided output hints do not align with the expected functionality, as they suggest that `func_1` operates on lists of integers, which is not relevant to the problem. Instead, `func_1` is used to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute values of `A_i` and `B_i`, which is crucial for identifying sardines that are on bad terms.

The program needs to correctly ignore pairs where both `A_i` and `B_i` are zero and should properly use the GCD to identify and handle sardines that are on bad terms. The current implementation fails to ignore the `(0, 0)` pairs, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and the original assessment remains accurate.
