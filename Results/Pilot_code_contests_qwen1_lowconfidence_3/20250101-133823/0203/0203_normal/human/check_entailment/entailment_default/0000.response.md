Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the binary search-like algorithm described in the problem statement. The code attempts to categorize pairs of sardines based on their deliciousness and fragrantness to avoid choosing sardines that are on bad terms. However, there are several issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Pairs**: The code attempts to categorize pairs based on the greatest common divisor (GCD) of their absolute values. This approach is not correct because it does not fully capture the condition \(A_i \cdot A_j + B_i \cdot B_j = 0\).

2. **Incorrect Logic for Special Cases**: The code handles special cases where one of the values is zero, but it does not correctly handle all possible cases. For instance, it should ensure that no pair of sardines on bad terms are selected, but the current logic does not guarantee this.

3. **Modular Arithmetic**: While the code uses modular arithmetic, it does not correctly compute the number of valid subsets of sardines. The logic for counting valid subsets is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly, such as when there are multiple sardines with the same pair of (deliciousness, fragrantness) values. It also does not handle the case where all sardines are on bad terms with each other, which would result in no valid subsets.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
