Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where both `A_i` and `B_i` are zero. According to the problem description, if both `A_i` and `B_i` are zero, the sardine is ignored. However, the current implementation does not skip such cases but still increments the count in the dictionary.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of GCD**: The function `func_1` is used to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD). However, this function is not defined within the program. Instead, you should use Python's built-in `math.gcd` function.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Multiples**: The logic for calculating multiples is flawed. Specifically, the lines `d[m1] += 1` and `d[m2] += 0` do not correctly account for all possible pairs of sardines that are on bad terms.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Multiplicity**: The program does not correctly handle the multiplicity of sardines that can be chosen together. It seems to assume that each unique direction vector `(m1, m2)` can be chosen independently, which is not necessarily true.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
