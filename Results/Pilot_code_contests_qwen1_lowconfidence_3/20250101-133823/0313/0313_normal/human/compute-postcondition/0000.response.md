The code initializes `ans` to 0, but it does not perform any operations that would change the values of `a` or `c`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 10^9, `c` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ c ≤ 10^9, `ans` is 0**
