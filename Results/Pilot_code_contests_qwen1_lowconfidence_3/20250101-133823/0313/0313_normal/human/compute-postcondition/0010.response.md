The code `a //= 3` updates the value of `a` by performing integer division of its original value by 3. Since `a` is initially the integer division of its original value by 3 and must be greater than 0, after this operation, `a` remains unchanged because dividing a number already divided by 3 by 3 again results in the same value (as long as it's an integer).

The other variables (`b`, `c`, and `ans`) are not affected by this code.

Since `a` remains the same after the operation, the expression for `ans` remains the same: 
\[ \text{ans} = (3 - a \% 3 + b \% 3) \% 3 \]

Given that `a` and `b` are both the integer division of their original values by 3 and must be greater than 0, the expression simplifies based on the properties of modulo operations and integer divisions. 

Output State: **`a` is the integer division of its original value by 3, `b` is the integer division of its original value by 3, both `a` and `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq 10^9\), `ans` is equal to \((3 - a \% 3 + b \% 3) \% 3\)**
