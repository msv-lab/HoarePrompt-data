The value of `ans` is multiplied by 3. Given the initial state where `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, multiplying by 3 will change the value of `ans` to 0, 3, or 6 respectively. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`) remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.

Output State: **`a` is the integer division of its original value by 3, `b` is the integer division of its original value by 3, both `a` and `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq 10^9\), `ans` is 0, 3, or 6**
