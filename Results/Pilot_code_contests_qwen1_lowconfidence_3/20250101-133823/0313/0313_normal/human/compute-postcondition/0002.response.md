Let's analyze the given `while` loop condition: `a > 0 and b > 0`.

1. For the loop to execute at least once, both `a` and `b` must be greater than 0.
2. The current state before the loop is: 
   - `a` is the first integer read from input.
   - `b` is the second integer read from input.
   - `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq 10^9\).
   - `ans` is 0.

To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, both `a` and `b` need to be greater than 0. Since the values of `a` and `b` are determined by the input, we need to make sure they satisfy this condition.

Given that `a` and `b` are read from input, the only way to adjust their states is to ensure they are positive integers.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is:
- Both `a` and `b` must be greater than 0.

The state right before the loop should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq 10^9\), `ans` is 0**
