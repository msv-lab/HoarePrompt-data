Output State: **`a` is the integer division of its original value by 3, `b` is the integer division of its value by 3 again, both `a` and `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq 10^9\), and `ans` is equal to 3 because (3 - a % 3 + b % 3) % 3 simplifies to 3 given the conditions on `a` and `b`.**
