Functionality: **The function reads two non-negative integers \(a\) and \(b\) from standard input, both within the range \(0 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). It then iteratively updates a variable `ans` based on the remainders of \(a\) and \(b\) when divided by 3, until both \(a\) and \(b\) become zero. Specifically, in each iteration, `ans` is first multiplied by 3, then incremented by \((3 - a \% 3 + b \% 3) \% 3\). After the loop completes, the function prints the final value of `ans`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value.**

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The code correctly handles the case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are initially zero, resulting in `ans` being printed as 0.
- The code correctly handles any positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) within the specified range, updating `ans` as described.
- However, the code does not explicitly handle the case where either \(a\) or \(b\) is zero before the other becomes zero. This would still follow the same logic but might be worth noting for completeness.
- There is no explicit handling for negative inputs or inputs outside the specified range \(0 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). In practice, since the input is read from standard input and the code relies on the correctness of the input, it is assumed that valid inputs are provided.
