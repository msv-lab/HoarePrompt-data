The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on the conditions provided. However, since no specific output conditions are given, we can only state that the function returns some value without additional details.

Given the constraints that `a` and `c` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, c \leq 10^9\), but these variables are not used within the function definition provided, the function likely returns a default or predefined value.

Functionality: **The function returns a value without accepting any parameters.**
