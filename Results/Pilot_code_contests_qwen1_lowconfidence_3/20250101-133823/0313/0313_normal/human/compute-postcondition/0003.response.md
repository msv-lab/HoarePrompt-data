`ans` is multiplied by 3. Initially, `ans` is 0, so multiplying 0 by any number (including 3) results in 0. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq 10^9\), `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq 10^9\), `ans` is 0**
