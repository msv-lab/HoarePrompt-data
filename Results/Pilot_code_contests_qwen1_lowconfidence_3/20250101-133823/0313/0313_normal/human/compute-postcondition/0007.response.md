Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `a > 0 and b > 0`.
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `a` is the integer division of its original value by 3.
  - `b` is the integer division of its original value by 3.
  - `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq 10^9\).
  - `ans` is 0, 1, or 2.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as both `a` and `b` are greater than 0.
   - Since `a` and `b` are both the integer division of their original values by 3, they will decrement each time through the loop until they reach 0.

2. **Current Values:**
   - `a` is the integer division of its original value by 3.
   - `b` is the integer division of its original value by 3.
   - Both `a` and `b` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

3. **Ensuring Loop Executes Again:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both `a` and `b` must be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since `a` and `b` are decremented by 1 in each iteration, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that both `a` and `b` are greater than 0.

### Conclusion:
- To ensure that the loop executes one more time, both `a` and `b` must be greater than 0.
- No changes are needed for `c` and `ans` because they do not affect the loop condition.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` is the integer division of its original value by 3, `b` is the integer division of its original value by 3, both `a` and `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq 10^9\), `ans` is 0, 1, or 2**
