`b` is originally the integer division of `a` by 3. The code `b //= 3` means `b` is now reassigned to the integer division of its current value by 3. Since `b` was originally the integer division of `a` by 3, dividing `b` by 3 again (integer division) means `b` will now be the integer division of `a / 9`.

Therefore, after executing the code, `b` will be the integer division of `a` by 9, while `a` remains a multiple of 3 greater than 0 after being divided by 3 again, `c` remains a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq 10^9\), and `ans` remains equal to 3.

Output State: **`a` is a multiple of 3 greater than 0 after being divided by 3 again, `b` is the integer division of `a` by 9, `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq 10^9\), and `ans` is equal to 3.**
