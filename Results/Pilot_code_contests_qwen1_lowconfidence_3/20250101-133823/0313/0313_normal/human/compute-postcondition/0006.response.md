`b` is assigned the integer division of its original value by 3, which is equivalent to `b //= 3`. This operation updates the value of `b` by performing floor division by 3. The states of the other variables (`a`, `c`, and `ans`) are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is the integer division of its original value by 3, `b` is the integer division of its original value by 3, `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq 10^9\), `ans` is 0 or 1 or 2**
