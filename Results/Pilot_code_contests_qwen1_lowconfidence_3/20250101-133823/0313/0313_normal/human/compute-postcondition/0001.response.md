The code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq 10^9\), and `ans` is 0. After executing the code, `a` and `b` will hold the values read from the input, while `c` and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer read from input, `b` is the second integer read from input, `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq 10^9\), `ans` is 0**
