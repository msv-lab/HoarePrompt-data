The code `a //= 3` performs integer division of `a` by 3 and assigns the result back to `a`. The other variables (`b`, `c`, and `ans`) are not affected.

Since `a` is a positive integer, after performing the operation `a //= 3`, the new value of `a` will be the integer division of its original value by 3. 

Output State: **`a` is the integer division of its original value by 3, `b` is a positive integer, `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq 10^9\), `ans` is 0 or 1 or 2**
