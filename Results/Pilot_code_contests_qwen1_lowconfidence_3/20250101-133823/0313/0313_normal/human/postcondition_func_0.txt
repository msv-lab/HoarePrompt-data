The function reads two non-negative integers \(a\) and \(b\) from standard input, both within the range \(0 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). It then iteratively updates a variable `ans` based on the remainders of \(a\) and \(b\) when divided by 3, until both \(a\) and \(b\) become zero. Specifically, in each iteration, `ans` is first multiplied by 3, then incremented by \((3 - a \% 3 + b \% 3) \% 3\). After the loop completes, the function prints the final value of `ans`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value.
