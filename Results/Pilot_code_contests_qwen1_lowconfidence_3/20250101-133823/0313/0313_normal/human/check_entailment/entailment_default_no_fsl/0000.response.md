Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the `tor` operation as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code only processes the digits of the numbers from right to left until both numbers become zero. However, the `tor` operation requires processing the numbers digit by digit, even if one number has more digits than the other. The code fails to handle the case where one number has more digits than the other, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input `387420489 225159023`. The correct output should be `1000000001`, but the provided code fails to produce this result because it incorrectly handles the longer number.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that both numbers have the same length by padding the shorter number with leading zeros before performing the digit-by-digit calculation.
