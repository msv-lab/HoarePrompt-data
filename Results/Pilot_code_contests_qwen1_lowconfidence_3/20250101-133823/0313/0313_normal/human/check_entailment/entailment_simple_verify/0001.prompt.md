You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Petya very much likes computers. Recently he has received a new "Ternatron IV" as a gift from his mother. Unlike other modern computers, "Ternatron IV" operates with ternary and not binary logic. Petya immediately wondered how the xor operation is performed on this computer (and whether there is anything like it).

It turned out that the operation does exist (however, it is called tor) and it works like this. Suppose that we need to calculate the value of the expression a tor b. Both numbers a and b are written in the ternary notation one under the other one (b under a). If they have a different number of digits, then leading zeroes are added to the shorter number until the lengths are the same. Then the numbers are summed together digit by digit. The result of summing each two digits is calculated modulo 3. Note that there is no carry between digits (i. e. during this operation the digits aren't transferred). For example: 1410 tor 5010 = 01123 tor 12123 = 10213 = 3410.

Petya wrote numbers a and c on a piece of paper. Help him find such number b, that a tor b = c. If there are several such numbers, print the smallest one.

Input

The first line contains two integers a and c (0 ≤ a, c ≤ 109). Both numbers are written in decimal notation.

Output

Print the single integer b, such that a tor b = c. If there are several possible numbers b, print the smallest one. You should print the number in decimal notation.

import sys

def func():
    ans = 0
    (a, b) = [int(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()]
    while a > 0 and b > 0:
        ans *= 3
        ans += (3 - a % 3 + b % 3) % 3
        a //= 3
        b //= 3
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the `tor` operation as described. Specifically, the program only processes the numbers digit by digit and performs the modulo operation, but it does not handle the case where the lengths of the numbers are different. When the lengths are different, the program should add leading zeros to the shorter number, which is not done in the current implementation.

For example, consider the input `14 34`. According to the problem description, the ternary representations are:
- 1410 = 12123
- 3410 = 10213

To perform the `tor` operation, both numbers need to be of the same length. Therefore, we should add leading zeros to 1410 to make it 012123. The correct `tor` operation would be:
```
012123
102130
------
110223
```
Converting 110223 back to decimal gives 50, which is the correct output.

However, the current program does not add these leading zeros and directly processes the numbers, which leads to an incorrect result. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is therefore incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and c are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, c ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    ans = 0
    a, b = [int(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()]
    while a > 0 and b > 0:
        ans *= 3
        
        ans += (3 - a % 3 + b % 3) % 3
        
        a //= 3
        
        b //= 3
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` and `b` are both 0, `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq 10^9\), and `ans` is the result of the accumulated updates based on the remainders of `a` and `b` modulo 3.
    print(ans)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
