Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the `tor` operation as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles the summation of digits modulo 3.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The `tor` operation is defined as follows:
  - Write numbers `a` and `c` in ternary form.
  - Add the corresponding digits of `a` and `c` modulo 3 without carrying over.
  - If `a` and `c` have different lengths, add leading zeros to the shorter number to match lengths.

#### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Digit-wise Summation**:
   - The program uses `(3 - a % 3 + b % 3) % 3` to perform the summation modulo 3. This formula is incorrect because it doesn't properly handle the addition of digits without carrying over. For example, `2 + 2 = 1` (mod 3), but the program would compute `(3 - 2 % 3 + 2 % 3) % 3 = (3 - 2 + 2) % 3 = 3 % 3 = 0`, which is incorrect.

2. **Lack of Ternary Conversion**:
   - The program assumes `a` and `b` are already in decimal form and directly performs operations on them, which is incorrect. It needs to convert `a` and `c` into their ternary representations and then perform the digit-wise summation.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly implement the `tor` operation, you need to:
1. Convert `a` and `c` to their ternary representations.
2. Perform the digit-wise summation modulo 3.
3. Construct the result from the summed digits.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a, c = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    base = 1
    
    while a > 0 or c > 0:
        # Extract the last digit in ternary representation
        a_digit = a % 3
        c_digit = c % 3
        
        # Perform the tor operation without carry
        ans += (3 - a_digit + c_digit) % 3 * base
        
        # Update the values
        a //= 3
        c //= 3
        
        # Shift the answer to the left
        base *= 3
    
    print(ans)

# Example usage:
func()
```

In this corrected version, the program correctly converts `a` and `c` to their ternary representations and performs the `tor` operation as specified.
