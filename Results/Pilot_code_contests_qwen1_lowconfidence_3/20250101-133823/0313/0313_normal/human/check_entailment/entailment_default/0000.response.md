Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the `tor` operation as described in the problem description. The `tor` operation requires performing the operation digit by digit on the ternary representations of the numbers, padding them with leading zeros if necessary, and then summing them modulo 3 without carrying over. However, the code only processes the least significant digit at each step, effectively treating the numbers as base-3 but not accounting for the correct ternary digit-wise addition.

To illustrate, let's consider an example:

- Input: \(a = 14_{10}\), \(c = 34_{10}\)
- Ternary representations: \(14_{10} = 112_3\), \(34_{10} = 1021_3\)

According to the problem description, to find \(b\) such that \(112_3 \, tor \, b = 1021_3\):

1. Pad \(112_3\) to match the length of \(1021_3\): \(0112_3\).
2. Perform the digit-wise modulo 3 addition:
   - \(0 \, tor \, ? = 1 \Rightarrow ? = 1\)
   - \(1 \, tor \, ? = 0 \Rightarrow ? = 2\)
   - \(1 \, tor \, ? = 2 \Rightarrow ? = 1\)
   - \(0 \, tor \, ? = 1 \Rightarrow ? = 1\)

So, \(b = 1211_3 = 46_{10}\).

However, the provided code calculates:
- \(14_{10} \, tor \, 50_{10} = 50_{10}\) (as shown in the example output, \(14_{10} \, tor \, 50_{10} = 50_{10}\)).

This discrepancy indicates that the code does not correctly implement the `tor` operation for the given inputs. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
