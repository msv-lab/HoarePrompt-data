Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program uses a fixed grid size of `400010` and shifts the coordinates by a large offset (`100005`). This approach assumes a specific range and transformation of coordinates, which might not cover all possible input scenarios.

Consider the following potential case:

- Input:
  ```
  3
  -100000 -100000
  100000 100000
  0 0
  ```

In this case, the transformed coordinates will exceed the predefined grid size of `400010`, leading to incorrect behavior. The program will not properly handle such large values, resulting in a potential overflow or incorrect comparison.

Therefore, the program is not correct as it fails to handle all possible input ranges without imposing arbitrary limits.
