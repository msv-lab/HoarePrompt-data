Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the problem requires determining the number of initial positions for the white token such that, if both players play optimally, the black player wins. The solution involves analyzing the movements of the tokens and the constraints given in the problem.

#### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Coordinate Transformation and Range Handling**:
   - The program performs transformations on coordinates and uses fixed ranges (e.g., `C = 400010`, `inf = 1001001001`) which might not cover all necessary cases. The transformations and ranges need to be carefully defined to account for the full range of coordinates from \([-10^5, 10^5]\).

2. **Misunderstanding of the Problem Constraints**:
   - The core logic for determining the winning strategy and counting valid starting positions for the white token is not correctly implemented. The program attempts to use various arrays (`lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, `rmx`) to track ranges of y-coordinates for different x-values, but these arrays are not used in a way that directly leads to the correct count of valid starting positions.

3. **Lack of Optimal Strategy Evaluation**:
   - The program does not explicitly evaluate the optimal strategy for both players. It seems to focus more on tracking coordinate ranges rather than simulating the game moves and determining the outcome based on the optimal play.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - The final output calculation `(lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2` is used to count the number of valid starting positions, but this formula is not derived from the correct logic for determining the winning strategy. The correct approach would involve simulating the game and determining the reachable positions for the white token under optimal play.

#### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Transform Coordinates**: Convert the original coordinates to a new coordinate system to simplify the analysis.
2. **Analyze Reachable Positions**: Determine the reachable positions for the white token after each move, considering the constraints.
3. **Optimal Strategy Evaluation**: Simulate the game and determine the winning strategy for the black player by checking if there is a strategy to block all possible moves for the white player.
4. **Count Valid Starting Positions**: Count the number of initial positions for the white token such that the black player can enforce a winning strategy.

Given the complexity of the problem, a direct implementation would likely involve more sophisticated algorithms and careful handling of edge cases.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is **False** according to the given problem description.
