You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Consider the following game for two players. There is one white token and some number of black tokens. Each token is placed on a plane in a point with integer coordinates x and y.

The players take turn making moves, white starts. On each turn, a player moves all tokens of their color by 1 to up, down, left or right. Black player can choose directions for each token independently.

After a turn of the white player the white token can not be in a point where a black token is located. There are no other constraints on locations of the tokens: positions of black tokens can coincide, after a turn of the black player and initially the white token can be in the same point with some black point. If at some moment the white player can't make a move, he loses. If the white player makes 10100500 moves, he wins.

You are to solve the following problem. You are given initial positions of all black tokens. It is guaranteed that initially all these positions are distinct. In how many places can the white token be located initially so that if both players play optimally, the black player wins?

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of black points.

The (i + 1)-th line contains two integers xi, yi ( - 105 ≤ xi, yi, ≤ 105) — the coordinates of the point where the i-th black token is initially located.

It is guaranteed that initial positions of black tokens are distinct.

Output

Print the number of points where the white token can be located initially, such that if both players play optimally, the black player wins.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:

from itertools import*

func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the x and y coordinates of a black token's initial position. All coordinates are integers within the range \([-10^5, 10^5]\), and the positions are distinct.
def func_1(a):
    inf = 1001001001
    C = 400010
    lmn = [inf] * 400010
    lmx = [-inf] * 400010
    for (x, y) in a:
        x = (x - 1) / 2 + 100005
        
        if lmn[x] > y:
            lmn[x] = y
        
        if lmx[x] < y:
            lmx[x] = y
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a list of tuples that may or may not have had their x values updated based on the condition `lmx[x] < y` for each tuple `(x, y)` in `a`. For every tuple `(x, y)` in `a`, if `lmx[x]` was less than `y` before the update, `lmn[x]` will be set to `y` and `x` will be updated to `((x - 1) / 2 + 100005)`. The lists `lmn` and `lmx` are updated accordingly for the x values that meet the condition. If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `a` is an empty list), then `a`, `lmn`, and `lmx` remain in their initial states.
    rmn = lmn[:]
    rmx = lmx[:]
    for i in xrange(200009):
        if lmn[i + 1] > lmn[i]:
            lmn[i + 1] = lmn[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lmn` is a list such that for all indices `i` (0 ≤ i < len(lmn) - 1), `lmn[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `lmn[i]`; `lmx` is in its previous state; `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`; `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`; `i` is 200008.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lmn` is a non-increasing list, `lmx` is in its previous state with `lmx[i]` for all `i` unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 200009.

        if rmn[i - 1] > rmn[i]:
            rmn[i - 1] = rmn[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `rmn[i]` is equal to the minimum value in the list `rmn` for all `i` from 0 to 200008, `rmx[i]` is unchanged for all `i`, `i` is 0.
    for i in xrange(200009, 0, -1):
        if rmx[i - 1] < rmx[i]:
            rmx[i - 1] = rmx[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations have finished.
    #
    #### Initial State
    #- `rmn[i]` is equal to the minimum value in the list `rmn` for all `i` from 0 to 200008.
    #- `rmx[i]` is unchanged for all `i`.
    #- `i` is 0.
    #
    #### Loop Code
    #```python
    #for i in xrange(200009, 0, -1):
    #    if rmx[i - 1] < rmx[i]:
    #        rmx[i - 1] = rmx[i]
    #```
    #
    #### Observations from Provided Output States
    #- After 1 iteration (`i` is 200008): `rmx[200008]` equals `rmx[200009]`.
    #- After 2 iterations (`i` is 200007): `rmx[200006]` equals `rmx[200007]` and `rmx[200007]` equals `rmx[200008]`.
    #- After 3 iterations (`i` is 200006): `rmx[200005]` equals `rmx[200006]` and `rmx[200007]` equals `rmx[200006]`.
    #
    #### General Pattern
    #Each iteration updates `rmx[i-1]` to be equal to `rmx[i]` if the condition `rmx[i-1] < rmx[i]` is satisfied. This process continues until `i` reaches 1.
    #
    #### Final State Analysis
    #When the loop completes, `i` will be 1. At this point, the only value that hasn't been compared is `rmx[0]` and `rmx[1]`. However, since all subsequent values of `rmx` from `i=2` to `i=200008` have already been updated to be equal to the next higher index value, we need to consider the relationship between `rmx[0]` and `rmx[1]`.
    #
    #Since the loop ensures that each `rmx[i-1]` is updated to be equal to `rmx[i]` if `rmx[i-1] < rmx[i]`, and this process starts from `i=200009` down to `i=1`, the final state will ensure that `rmx[0]` is the maximum value among all `rmx[i]` for `i` from 1 to 200008.
    #
    #### Output State
    #After the loop completes, the value of `rmx[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 200008 will be equal to the maximum value of `rmx[i]` for all `i` from 1 to 200008. The variable `i` will be 1.
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #- `i` is 1.
    #- For all `i` from 0 to 200008, `rmx[i]` is the maximum value of `rmx[i]` for `i` from 1 to 200008.
    for i in xrange(200010):
        if lmn[i] < rmn[i]:
            lmn[i] = rmn[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: - `i` is 200009.
    #- For all `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmn[i]` is equal to `rmn[i]`.
    #
    #Output State:
    for i in xrange(200010):
        if lmx[i] > rmx[i]:
            lmx[i] = rmx[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: For all `i` from 0 to 200008, if `lmx[i] > rmx[i]`, then `lmn[i]` is equal to `rmn[i]` and `lmx[i]` is now equal to `rmx[i]`; otherwise, `lmn[i]` and `lmx[i]` remain unchanged as they were originally.
    ans = 0
    for i in xrange(200009):
        if lmn[i] < lmn[i + 1]:
            lmn[i] = lmn[i + 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lmn` array is such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200007), `lmn[i]` is the minimum value between `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmx` and `rmx` arrays are defined and contain appropriate values, `ans` is 0.
    for i in xrange(200009):
        if lmx[i] > lmx[i + 1]:
            lmx[i] = lmx[i + 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lmn` array remains such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200007), `lmn[i]` is the minimum value between `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`; `lmx` array is updated such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200008), `lmx[i]` is equal to `lmx[i + 1]`; `rmx` array remains unchanged; `ans` is 0.
    for i in xrange(200009):
        if lmn[i] < lmx[i]:
            ans += (lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lmn` array remains such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200007), `lmn[i]` is the minimum value between `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmx` array remains such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200008), `lmx[i]` is equal to `lmx[i + 1]`, `rmx` array remains unchanged, and `ans` is the sum of `(lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2` for all `i` where `lmn[i] < lmx[i]` and the loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = 200008`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the sum of (lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2 for all i where lmn[i] < lmx[i] and the loop iterates from i = 0 to i = 200008

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `n` is an integer representing the number of black tokens, and `dat` is an iterable containing pairs of integers representing the x and y coordinates of each black token. The tokens' coordinates are read from standard input in a way that `dat` is a flat sequence of 2*n integers, with each pair of integers representing the coordinates of one black token.
def func_2():
    n = int(stdin.readline())
    dat = map(int, stdin.read().split(), repeat(10, 2 * n))
    s = [[], []]
    for i in xrange(n):
        x, y = dat[i * 2:i * 2 + 2]
        
        s[x + y & 1].append((-x + y, x + y))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.
    #
    #### Loop Code Analysis
    #The loop iterates over the range from 0 to \( n-1 \). For each iteration \( i \), it extracts two elements from the `dat` list and assigns them to `x` and `y`. It then appends a tuple `(-x + y, x + y)` to the appropriate list in `s` based on the condition `x + y & 1`.
    #
    #### Iteration Details
    #- **First Iteration (i=0):**
    #  - `x` is `dat[0]`
    #  - `y` is `dat[1]`
    #  - `s[x + y & 1]` is updated with the tuple `(-dat[0] + dat[1], dat[0] + dat[1])`
    #
    #- **Second Iteration (i=1):**
    #  - `x` is `dat[2]`
    #  - `y` is `dat[3]`
    #  - `s[x + y & 1]` is updated with the tuple `(-dat[2] + dat[3], dat[2] + dat[3])`
    #
    #- **Third Iteration (i=2):**
    #  - `x` is `dat[4]`
    #  - `y` is `dat[5]`
    #  - `s[x + y & 1]` is updated with the tuple `(-dat[4] + dat[5], dat[4] + dat[5])`
    #
    #### General Pattern
    #- After the loop finishes, the `s` list will contain two sublists where each sublist contains tuples of the form `(-x + y, x + y)` depending on whether `x + y` is even or odd.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #Since the loop will execute exactly \( n \) times if `n > 0`, the final state of the variables will be as follows:
    #
    #- `n` will be the number of black tokens, and `n` must be a non-negative integer.
    #- `dat` will remain unchanged, as it is only read from during the loop.
    #- `s` will be a list containing two sublists. Each sublist will contain tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` where `x` and `y` are the coordinates of the black tokens such that `x + y` is even or odd respectively.
    #
    #### Output State
    #**Output State:**
    #``n` is a non-negative integer, `dat` is an iterable of integers representing the coordinates of each black token, `s` is a list containing two sublists where the first sublist contains tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` for even `x + y` and the second sublist contains tuples for odd `x + y`.
    #```

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
