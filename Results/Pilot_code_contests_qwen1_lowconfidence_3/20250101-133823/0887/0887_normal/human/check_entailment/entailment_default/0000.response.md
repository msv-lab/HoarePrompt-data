Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the number of valid initial positions for the white token such that the black player wins if both players play optimally. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not accurately capture the strategic aspects of the game described.

To explain in more detail:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function seems to be processing coordinates in a way that doesn't align with the problem requirements. It calculates values based on adjusted coordinates, but the logic for determining the number of valid starting positions for the white token is not implemented. The final sum calculation in `func_1` does not correspond to the number of valid starting positions.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads input and processes it using `func_1`, but it also does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. The grouping of coordinates into even and odd sums does not address the strategic aspects of the game, and the final output does not correctly represent the number of valid starting positions for the white token.

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of valid initial positions for the white token. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
