Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of black tokens `n` and the coordinates of the black tokens from standard input. It correctly processes the input to group the coordinates into two lists based on whether the sum of the coordinates is even or odd.

2. **Processing Coordinates**:
   - The function `func_1` processes the grouped coordinates to compute the number of valid starting positions for the white token. The processing involves adjusting the coordinates and using dynamic programming-like operations to calculate the number of valid positions.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge cases where the number of black tokens is 1 or more. The annotations and the implementation ensure that the coordinates are processed correctly, and the resulting sum is calculated appropriately.
   - The code correctly handles the case where the input coordinates are distinct and within the specified range.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The code ensures that the black player can always force a win by blocking the white player's movements. This is achieved by the way the coordinates are grouped and processed, ensuring that the white token cannot be in a position where a black token is located after each move.

5. **Output Calculation**:
   - The final output is the sum of the valid positions calculated by `func_1` for both even and odd coordinate sums, which correctly reflects the number of starting positions for the white token where the black player can force a win.

Given that the code follows the problem description and handles all the provided examples correctly, and there are no identified edge cases where the code fails, the code is correct.
