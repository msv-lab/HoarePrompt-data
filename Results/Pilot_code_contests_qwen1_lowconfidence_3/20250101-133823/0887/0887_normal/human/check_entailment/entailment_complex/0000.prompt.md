You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Consider the following game for two players. There is one white token and some number of black tokens. Each token is placed on a plane in a point with integer coordinates x and y.

The players take turn making moves, white starts. On each turn, a player moves all tokens of their color by 1 to up, down, left or right. Black player can choose directions for each token independently.

After a turn of the white player the white token can not be in a point where a black token is located. There are no other constraints on locations of the tokens: positions of black tokens can coincide, after a turn of the black player and initially the white token can be in the same point with some black point. If at some moment the white player can't make a move, he loses. If the white player makes 10100500 moves, he wins.

You are to solve the following problem. You are given initial positions of all black tokens. It is guaranteed that initially all these positions are distinct. In how many places can the white token be located initially so that if both players play optimally, the black player wins?

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of black points.

The (i + 1)-th line contains two integers xi, yi ( - 105 ≤ xi, yi, ≤ 105) — the coordinates of the point where the i-th black token is initially located.

It is guaranteed that initial positions of black tokens are distinct.

Output

Print the number of points where the white token can be located initially, such that if both players play optimally, the black player wins.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the x and y coordinates of a black token's initial position. All coordinates are integers within the range \([-10^5, 10^5]\), and the positions are distinct.

        x = (x - 1) / 2 + 100005
        
        if lmn[x] > y:

For every tuple `(x, y)` in `a`, if `lmx[x]` was less than `y` before the update, `lmn[x]` will be set to `y` and `x` will be updated to `((x - 1) / 2 + 100005)`. The lists `lmn` and `lmx` are updated accordingly for the x values that meet the condition. If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `a` is an empty list), then `a`, `lmn`, and `lmx` remain in their initial states.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations have finished.
    #
    #### Initial State
    #- `rmn[i]` is equal to the minimum value in the list `rmn` for all `i` from 0 to 200008.
    #- `rmx[i]` is unchanged for all `i`.
    #- `i` is 0.
    #
    #### Loop Code
    #```python
    #for i in xrange(200009, 0, -1):
    #    if rmx[i - 1] < rmx[i]:
    #        rmx[i - 1] = rmx[i]
    #```
    #
    #### Observations from Provided Output States
    #- After 1 iteration (`i` is 200008): `rmx[200008]` equals `rmx[200009]`.
    #- After 2 iterations (`i` is 200007): `rmx[200006]` equals `rmx[200007]` and `rmx[200007]` equals `rmx[200008]`.
    #- After 3 iterations (`i` is 200006): `rmx[200005]` equals `rmx[200006]` and `rmx[200007]` equals `rmx[200006]`.
    #
    #### General Pattern
    #Each iteration updates `rmx[i-1]` to be equal to `rmx[i]` if the condition `rmx[i-1] < rmx[i]` is satisfied. This process continues until `i` reaches 1.
    #
    #### Final State Analysis
    #When the loop completes, `i` will be 1. At this point, the only value that hasn't been compared is `rmx[0]` and `rmx[1]`. However, since all subsequent values of `rmx` from `i=2` to `i=200008` have already been updated to be equal to the next higher index value, we need to consider the relationship between `rmx[0]` and `rmx[1]`.
    #
    #Since the loop ensures that each `rmx[i-1]` is updated to be equal to `rmx[i]` if `rmx[i-1] < rmx[i]`, and this process starts from `i=200009` down to `i=1`, the final state will ensure that `rmx[0]` is the maximum value among all `rmx[i]` for `i` from 1 to 200008.
    #
    #### Output State
    #After the loop completes, the value of `rmx[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 200008 will be equal to the maximum value of `rmx[i]` for all `i` from 1 to 200008. The variable `i` will be 1.
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #- `i` is 1.
    #- For all `i` from 0 to 200008, `rmx[i]` is the maximum value of `rmx[i]` for `i` from 1 to 200008.
    for i in xrange(200010):
        if lmn[i] < rmn[i]:
            lmn[i] = rmn[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: - `i` is 200009.
    #- For all `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmn[i]` is equal to `rmn[i]`.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: For all `i` from 0 to 200008, if `lmx[i] > rmx[i]`, then `lmn[i]` is equal to `rmn[i]` and `lmx[i]` is now equal to `rmx[i]`; otherwise, `lmn[i]` and `lmx[i]` remain unchanged as they were originally.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lmn` array remains such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200007), `lmn[i]` is the minimum value between `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`; `lmx` array is updated such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200008), `lmx[i]` is equal to `lmx[i + 1]`; `rmx` array remains unchanged; `ans` is 0.
    for i in xrange(200009):
        if lmn[i] < lmx[i]:
            ans += (lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lmn` array remains such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200007), `lmn[i]` is the minimum value between `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmx` array remains such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200008), `lmx[i]` is equal to `lmx[i + 1]`, `rmx` array remains unchanged, and `ans` is the sum of `(lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2` for all `i` where `lmn[i] < lmx[i]` and the loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = 200008`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the sum of (lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2 for all i where lmn[i] < lmx[i] and the loop iterates from i = 0 to i = 200008
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the x and y coordinates of a black token's initial position. The function processes these coordinates and computes a specific sum based on the values stored in the lists `lmn` and `lmx`.

1. The function initializes several lists (`lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, `rmx`) and constants (`C`, `inf`). It then iterates over the input list `a`, updating `lmn` and `lmx` based on the y-coordinates and x-coordinates adjusted by the formula `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005`.

2. Next, the function processes `lmn` and `lmx` to ensure they are non-increasing sequences by iterating through them and updating values if necessary. Specifically, it ensures that for each index `i`, `lmn[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `lmn[i]` and similarly for `lmx`.

3. The function then ensures that `rmn` and `rmx` represent the minimum and maximum values respectively, by iterating backward and updating values if necessary.

4. After ensuring the properties of `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx`, the function updates `lmn` and `lmx` to reflect the minimum values found in `rmn` and the maximum values found in `rmx`.

5. Finally, the function calculates the sum of `(lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2` for all indices `i` where `lmn[i] < lmx[i]` and returns this sum.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `n` is an integer representing the number of black tokens, and `dat` is an iterable containing pairs of integers representing the x and y coordinates of each black token. The tokens' coordinates are read from standard input in a way that `dat` is a flat sequence of 2*n integers, with each pair of integers representing the coordinates of one black token.
def func_2():
    n = int(stdin.readline())
    dat = map(int, stdin.read().split(), repeat(10, 2 * n))
    s = [[], []]
    for i in xrange(n):
        x, y = dat[i * 2:i * 2 + 2]
        
        s[x + y & 1].append((-x + y, x + y))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.
    #
    #### Loop Code Analysis
    #The loop iterates over the range from 0 to \( n-1 \). For each iteration \( i \), it extracts two elements from the `dat` list and assigns them to `x` and `y`. It then appends a tuple `(-x + y, x + y)` to the appropriate list in `s` based on the condition `x + y & 1`.
    #
    #### Iteration Details
    #- **First Iteration (i=0):**
    #  - `x` is `dat[0]`
    #  - `y` is `dat[1]`
    #  - `s[x + y & 1]` is updated with the tuple `(-dat[0] + dat[1], dat[0] + dat[1])`
    #
    #- **Second Iteration (i=1):**
    #  - `x` is `dat[2]`
    #  - `y` is `dat[3]`
    #  - `s[x + y & 1]` is updated with the tuple `(-dat[2] + dat[3], dat[2] + dat[3])`
    #
    #- **Third Iteration (i=2):**
    #  - `x` is `dat[4]`
    #  - `y` is `dat[5]`
    #  - `s[x + y & 1]` is updated with the tuple `(-dat[4] + dat[5], dat[4] + dat[5])`
    #
    #### General Pattern
    #- After the loop finishes, the `s` list will contain two sublists where each sublist contains tuples of the form `(-x + y, x + y)` depending on whether `x + y` is even or odd.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #Since the loop will execute exactly \( n \) times if `n > 0`, the final state of the variables will be as follows:
    #
    #- `n` will be the number of black tokens, and `n` must be a non-negative integer.
    #- `dat` will remain unchanged, as it is only read from during the loop.
    #- `s` will be a list containing two sublists. Each sublist will contain tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` where `x` and `y` are the coordinates of the black tokens such that `x + y` is even or odd respectively.
    #
    #### Output State
    #**Output State:**
    #``n` is a non-negative integer, `dat` is an iterable of integers representing the coordinates of each black token, `s` is a list containing two sublists where the first sublist contains tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` for even `x + y` and the second sublist contains tuples for odd `x + y`.
    #```
    print(func_1(s[0]) + func_1(s[1]))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` and a flat sequence of 2*n integers representing the coordinates of black tokens from standard input. It processes these coordinates to group them into two lists based on whether the sum of the coordinates (x + y) is even or odd. Specifically, it creates a list `s` containing two sublists: the first sublist contains tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` for even sums, and the second sublist contains tuples for odd sums. Finally, it prints the sum of the outputs of `func_1` applied to these two sublists.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
