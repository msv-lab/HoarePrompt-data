Final: **False**

Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Token Positions**: The function `func_1` uses a large fixed range (400010) and does not properly handle the positions of the black tokens. This approach is overly simplistic and does not accurately reflect the game's rules, especially regarding the relative positions of tokens.

2. **Misunderstanding of Movement Constraints**: The program does not correctly simulate the movement constraints of the game. Specifically, it does not ensure that after a move by the white player, the white token cannot occupy the same position as any black token. The logic used in `func_1` does not account for these constraints.

3. **Lack of Strategic Consideration**: The problem requires determining the number of starting positions for the white token such that the black player can always win if both players play optimally. The current implementation does not handle this strategic aspect of the game correctly.

4. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Starting Positions**: The program attempts to calculate the number of valid starting positions for the white token, but the logic used is flawed. The provided annotations show that the function does not correctly reflect the game's rules and does not produce the expected results.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of "Final: False" is accurate.
