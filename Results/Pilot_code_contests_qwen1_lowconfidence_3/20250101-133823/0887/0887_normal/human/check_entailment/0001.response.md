Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` seems to attempt to calculate the number of valid starting positions for the white token, but it does not accurately reflect the game's rules.

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Positions**: The function `func_1` uses a fixed range of 400010 and performs operations on this range without considering the actual positions of the black tokens. This fixed range is likely too large and does not account for the relative positions of the black tokens correctly.

2. **Misinterpretation of Movement Rules**: The program attempts to simulate movements and positions of tokens, but it does not correctly handle the constraints and rules of the game. For instance, it does not properly ensure that after a move by the white player, the white token cannot occupy the same position as any black token.

3. **Lack of Optimal Strategy Handling**: The problem requires the program to determine the number of starting positions for the white token such that the black player can always win if both players play optimally. The current implementation does not handle this optimal strategy correctly.

To verify this, consider the following test case:

### Test Case:
```
Input:
4
-2 0
-1 1
0 -2
1 -1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
4
```

This discrepancy indicates that the program is not correctly calculating the number of valid starting positions for the white token. The program incorrectly counts more positions than it should, failing to account for the strategic constraints of the game.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
