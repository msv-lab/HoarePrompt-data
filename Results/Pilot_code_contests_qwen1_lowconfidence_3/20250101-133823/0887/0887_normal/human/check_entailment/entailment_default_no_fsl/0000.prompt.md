You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Consider the following game for two players. There is one white token and some number of black tokens. Each token is placed on a plane in a point with integer coordinates x and y.

The players take turn making moves, white starts. On each turn, a player moves all tokens of their color by 1 to up, down, left or right. Black player can choose directions for each token independently.

After a turn of the white player the white token can not be in a point where a black token is located. There are no other constraints on locations of the tokens: positions of black tokens can coincide, after a turn of the black player and initially the white token can be in the same point with some black point. If at some moment the white player can't make a move, he loses. If the white player makes 10100500 moves, he wins.

You are to solve the following problem. You are given initial positions of all black tokens. It is guaranteed that initially all these positions are distinct. In how many places can the white token be located initially so that if both players play optimally, the black player wins?

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of black points.

The (i + 1)-th line contains two integers xi, yi ( - 105 ≤ xi, yi, ≤ 105) — the coordinates of the point where the i-th black token is initially located.

It is guaranteed that initial positions of black tokens are distinct.

Output

Print the number of points where the white token can be located initially, such that if both players play optimally, the black player wins.

Note

In the first and second examples initial positions of black tokens are shown with black points, possible positions of the white token (such that the black player wins) are shown with white points.

In the third example the white tokens should be located in the inner square 2 × 2, to make the black player win. <image>

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the x and y coordinates of a black token's initial position. The function processes these coordinates and computes a specific sum based on the values stored in the lists `lmn` and `lmx`.

1. The function initializes several lists (`lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, `rmx`) and constants (`C`, `inf`). It then iterates over the input list `a`, updating `lmn` and `lmx` based on the y-coordinates and x-coordinates adjusted by the formula `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005`.

2. Next, the function processes `lmn` and `lmx` to ensure they are non-increasing sequences by iterating through them and updating values if necessary. Specifically, it ensures that for each index `i`, `lmn[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `lmn[i]` and similarly for `lmx`.

3. The function then ensures that `rmn` and `rmx` represent the minimum and maximum values respectively, by iterating backward and updating values if necessary.

4. After ensuring the properties of `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx`, the function updates `lmn` and `lmx` to reflect the minimum values found in `rmn` and the maximum values found in `rmx`.

5. Finally, the function calculates the sum of `(lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2` for all indices `i` where `lmn[i] < lmx[i]` and returns this sum.

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` and a flat sequence of 2*n integers representing the coordinates of black tokens from standard input. It processes these coordinates to group them into two lists based on whether the sum of the coordinates (x + y) is even or odd. Specifically, it creates a list `s` containing two sublists: the first sublist contains tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` for even sums, and the second sublist contains tuples for odd sums. Finally, it prints the sum of the outputs of `func_1` applied to these two sublists.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
