Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not properly handle the game rules and the optimal strategy for the black player to win. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Coordinates**: The code uses the coordinates `(-x + y, x + y)` to group the black tokens. This transformation does not align with the problem statement, which describes moving tokens up, down, left, or right on a grid.

2. **Non-Optimal Grouping Strategy**: The grouping based on the parity of `x + y` does not reflect the optimal strategy for the black player to ensure the white player cannot move. The black player can move each token independently in any direction, but the current implementation does not account for this flexibility.

3. **Sum Calculation**: The calculation of the sum using `func_1` on the transformed coordinates does not correctly determine the number of initial positions for the white token where the black player can win. The transformation and grouping methods used do not match the intended game logic.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should focus on determining the safe areas for the white token based on the black tokens' positions without transforming the coordinates in a way that misrepresents the game's dynamics. The current approach incorrectly assumes a simplified grouping method that does not capture the complexity of the game's rules.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, leading to an incorrect solution.
