Postcondition: ***`lmn` is in its previous state where the second element equals the first element; `lmx` remains unchanged; `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`; `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`; `i` is 2. If the third element of `lmn` is greater than the second element, the third and fourth elements of `lmn` remain as `[b, b]`. Otherwise, the state of `lmn` remains unchanged.***
