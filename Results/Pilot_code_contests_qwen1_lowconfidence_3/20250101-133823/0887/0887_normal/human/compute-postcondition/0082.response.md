Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 200009.
- For all `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmn[i]` is equal to `rmn[i]`.

### For Loop:
```
for i in xrange(200010):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates from `0` to `200009`, inclusive. This means the loop will run for 200010 iterations.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` given is `200009`.
3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: Since the loop starts at `0` and goes up to `200009`, the condition `0 <= i < 200010` must hold true.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- **Initial Value of `i`**: We need to adjust `i` to start at `0` for the loop to begin execution.
- **Values of `lmn[i]` and `rmn[i]`**: The problem statement says that for all `i` from `0` to `200008`, `lmn[i]` is equal to `rmn[i]`. This means we need to ensure that this condition holds for these values of `i`.

### Final State:
To ensure the loop can execute correctly, we need to adjust the initial value of `i` to `0` and ensure that the condition `lmn[i] == rmn[i]` holds for all `i` from `0` to `200008`.

State: **`i` is 0, `lmn[i]` is equal to `rmn[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 200008**
