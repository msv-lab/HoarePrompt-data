Postcondition: **`a` is a list of tuples that may or may not have had their x values updated based on the condition `lmx[x] < y` for each tuple `(x, y)` in `a`, `lmn` is in its previous state, `lmx` is in its previous state, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, and `i` is 0, the current value of `lmn[i + 1]` is greater than the current value of `lmn[i]`**
