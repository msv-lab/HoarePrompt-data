Postcondition: ***`lmn` is a non-increasing list, `lmx` is in its previous state with `lmx[i + 1]` equal to `lmx[i]`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 200008. Since the if condition `lmx[i + 1] < lmx[i]` is false, the program does not enter the if block and remains in the state described in the else part, where no changes occur.***
