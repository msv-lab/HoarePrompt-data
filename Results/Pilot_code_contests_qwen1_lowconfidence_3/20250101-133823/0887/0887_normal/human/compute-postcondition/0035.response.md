Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `lmn` is a list where the second element is equal to the first element.
   - `lmx` is in its previous state (unchanged).
   - `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
   - `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
   - `i` is 2.

2. Code Execution:
   - The code `lmn[i + 1] = lmn[i]` means that the element at index `i + 1` in `lmn` is set to the value of the element at index `i`.
   - Given that `i` is 2, this translates to setting `lmn[3]` to `lmn[2]`.

3. After executing the code:
   - The list `lmn` will now have its fourth element (`lmn[3]`) set to the value of its third element (`lmn[2]`).
   - Since `lmn` initially had the second element equal to the first element, let's assume `lmn = [a, a, b, b]` for simplicity. After the operation, `lmn` becomes `[a, a, b, b]`, where `b` remains unchanged because `lmn[3]` was already equal to `lmn[2]`.
   - `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx` remain unchanged because they are shallow copies of `lmn` and no direct assignments to them are made.

Output State: **`lmn` is `[a, a, b, b]`, `lmx` is in its previous state, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `[a, a, b, b]`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 2**
