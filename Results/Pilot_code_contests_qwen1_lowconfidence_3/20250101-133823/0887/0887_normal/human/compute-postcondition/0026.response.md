The code `rmx = lmx[:]` creates a shallow copy of the list `lmx` and assigns it to `rmx`. This means that `rmx` now contains the same elements as `lmx`, but changes to `rmx` will not affect `lmx`, and vice versa. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples that may or may not have had their x values updated based on the condition `lmx[x] < y` for each tuple `(x, y)` in `a`; `lmn` is equal to its previous state; `lmx` is equal to its previous state; `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`; `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`**
