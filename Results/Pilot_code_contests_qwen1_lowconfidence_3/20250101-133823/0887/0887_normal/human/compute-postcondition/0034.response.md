Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `lmn` is in its previous state, with the second element equal to the first element.
- `lmx` is in its previous state.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
- `i` is 1.
- The condition `lmn[i + 1] > lmn[i]` is checked, and if true, the state remains unchanged as no modifications are made inside the if part. Since there is no else part, the postcondition is the same as the precondition.

### For Loop
```python
for i in xrange(200009):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis
- The loop starts with `i = 1`.
- The loop will increment `i` by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop will continue until `i` reaches 200009.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment of States
1. **Current State**: `i` is 1.
2. **Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.

### Updated State
- `lmn` remains in its previous state, with the second element equal to the first element.
- `lmx` remains in its previous state.
- `rmn` is still a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is still a shallow copy of `lmx`.
- `i` will be 2.

### Final State
State: **`lmn` is in its previous state, with the second element equal to the first element; `lmx` is in its previous state; `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`; `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`; `i` is 2**
