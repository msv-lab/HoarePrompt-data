Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the x and y coordinates of a black token's initial position. The function processes these coordinates and computes a specific sum based on the values stored in the lists `lmn` and `lmx`.

1. The function initializes several lists (`lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, `rmx`) and constants (`C`, `inf`). It then iterates over the input list `a`, updating `lmn` and `lmx` based on the y-coordinates and x-coordinates adjusted by the formula `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005`.

2. Next, the function processes `lmn` and `lmx` to ensure they are non-increasing sequences by iterating through them and updating values if necessary. Specifically, it ensures that for each index `i`, `lmn[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `lmn[i]` and similarly for `lmx`.

3. The function then ensures that `rmn` and `rmx` represent the minimum and maximum values respectively, by iterating backward and updating values if necessary.

4. After ensuring the properties of `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx`, the function updates `lmn` and `lmx` to reflect the minimum values found in `rmn` and the maximum values found in `rmx`.

5. Finally, the function calculates the sum of `(lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2` for all indices `i` where `lmn[i] < lmx[i]` and returns this sum.**

Potential Edge Cases:
- If the input list `a` is empty, the function will initialize `lmn` and `lmx` with default values but will not perform any updates based on the elements in `a`. The final output will be determined solely by the initialization and the processing of the lists.

Missing Functionality:
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where all y-coordinates in `a` are the same. In such a scenario, the values in `lmn` and `lmx` would remain unchanged, leading to a sum of zero. However, the function correctly handles this case by initializing `lmn` and `lmx` with extreme values (`inf` and `-inf` respectively).

Final State:
- The function returns the sum of `(lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2` for all `i` where `lmn[i] < lmx[i]` and the loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = 200008`.
