The code `lmx[i + 1] = lmx[i]` assigns the value of `lmx[i]` to `lmx[i + 1]`. Given that `lmn` is a non-increasing list and `lmx` is in its previous state (a shallow copy of `lmn`), the value of `lmx[i + 1]` before the assignment is less than the value of `lmx[i]`. After the assignment, the value of `lmx[i + 1]` becomes equal to the value of `lmx[i]`, which means `lmx[i + 1]` is no longer less than `lmx[i]`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `lmn`, `rmn`, `rmx` retain their previous states, and `i` remains 200008.

Output State: **`lmn` is a non-increasing list, `lmx` is in its previous state with `lmx[i + 1]` equal to `lmx[i]`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 200008**
