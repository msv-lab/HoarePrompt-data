Postcondition: ***`lmn` is in its previous state, with the second element equal to the first element; `lmx` is in its previous state; `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`; `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`; `i` is 1. The condition `lmn[i + 1] > lmn[i]` is checked, and if true, the state remains unchanged as no modifications are made inside the if part. Since there is no else part, the postcondition is the same as the precondition.***
