Postcondition: ***`lmn` array remains such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200007), `lmn[i]` is the minimum value between `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmx` array remains such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200008), `lmx[i]` is equal to `lmx[i + 1]`, `rmx` array remains unchanged. `ans` is increased by `(lmx[200008] - lmn[200008]) / 2` if `lmn[200008] < lmx[200008]` and `i` is 200010. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged and `i` is 200009.***
