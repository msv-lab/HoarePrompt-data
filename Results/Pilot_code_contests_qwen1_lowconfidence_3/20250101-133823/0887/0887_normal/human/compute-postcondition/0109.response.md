To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will continue to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `lmn` array remains such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200007), `lmn[i]` is the minimum value between `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`.
   - `lmx` and `rmx` arrays are defined and contain appropriate values.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - If `lmx[i]` is greater than `lmx[i + 1]`, the program does not change `lmx[i]` and `lmx[i + 1]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i` starting at 0 up to `200008` (since `xrange(200009)` means `i` ranges from 0 to 200008 inclusive).

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so the next value of `i` would be `k + 1`.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < 200009`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - The state of the arrays `lmn`, `lmx`, and `rmx` remains unchanged based on the given conditions.
   - `ans` remains 0 since there is no condition that changes its value within the loop.

### Final State:

- `i` is incremented to `k + 1`.
- The state of `lmn`, `lmx`, and `rmx` remains the same.
- `ans` remains 0.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`lmn` array remains such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200007), `lmn[i]` is the minimum value between `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`. `lmx` and `rmx` arrays are defined and contain appropriate values. `ans` is 0. `i` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**
