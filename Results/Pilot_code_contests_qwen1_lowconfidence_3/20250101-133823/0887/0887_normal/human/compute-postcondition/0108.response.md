Postcondition: ***`lmn` array remains such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200007), `lmn[i]` is the minimum value between `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`. `lmx` and `rmx` arrays are defined and contain appropriate values. `ans` is 0. If `lmx[i]` is greater than `lmx[i + 1]`, the program does not change `lmx[i]` and `lmx[i + 1]`. Otherwise, no change occurs since there is no else part specified.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program variables after the execution of the given if-else block, considering the condition `lmx[i] > lmx[i + 1]` and the absence of an else part.
