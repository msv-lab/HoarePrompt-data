`rmn[i - 1]` is assigned the value of `rmn[i]`. Since `i` is 199998, `rmn[i - 1]` corresponds to `rmn[199997]`. Given that `rmn[i - 1]` and `rmn[i]` are initially equal, after the assignment, both `rmn[199997]` and `rmn[199998]` will hold the same value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rmn[199997]` and `rmn[199998]` are equal, and `i` is 199998**
