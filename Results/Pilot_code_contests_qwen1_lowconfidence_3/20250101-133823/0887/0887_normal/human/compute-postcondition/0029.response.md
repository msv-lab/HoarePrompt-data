The code `lmn[i + 1] = lmn[i]` updates the value of `lmn[i + 1]` to be the same as the value of `lmn[i]`. Given the initial conditions:

- `lmn` is in its previous state
- `lmx` is in its previous state
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`
- `i` is 0
- The current value of `lmn[i + 1]` is greater than the current value of `lmn[i]`

After executing the code, the value of `lmn[i + 1]` will be equal to the value of `lmn[i]`. Since `i` is 0, this means `lmn[1]` (the second element of `lmn`) will now be equal to the first element of `lmn`.

The output state is:

Output State: **`lmn` is in its previous state, with the second element equal to the first element; `lmx` is in its previous state; `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`; `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`; `i` is 0**
