According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range specified by `xrange(200009)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 200009.

Since the loop range is `xrange(200009)`, the loop will stop when `i` reaches 200009. Therefore, the loop will not execute one more time because `i` has already reached the upper limit of the range.

However, we need to ensure all other states remain consistent with the given conditions:

- `lmn` is a non-increasing list.
- `lmx` is in its previous state with `lmx[i + 1]` equal to `lmx[i]`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.

Since the loop does not execute again, the values of `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx` do not change from their previous states.

State: **`lmn` is a non-increasing list, `lmx` is in its previous state with `lmx[i + 1]` equal to `lmx[i]`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 200009**
