Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in the list `a`. The loop body reassigns the tuple at index `x` in `a` to `y` if `lmx[x] < y` is true. Otherwise, it leaves the list `a` unchanged.

2. **Identify Variables Involved**: The relevant variables here are `a`, `lmx`, and `y`. The variable `x` is derived from the loop itself and doesn't need to be considered as a state change because it's an index within the list `a`.

3. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**: We need to determine what needs to change for the loop to execute again. Specifically, we need to check if there are any tuples in `a` where `lmx[x] < y` is true.

4. **Analyze the Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, there must be at least one tuple `(x, y)` in `a` such that `lmx[x] < y` is true.
   - If no such tuple exists, the loop will terminate.

5. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `lmn` and other variables remain unchanged, they don't affect the continuation of the loop.
   - The list `a` might or might not be changed depending on the condition `lmx[x] < y`.

6. **Formulate the New State**:
   - To ensure the loop continues, `a` must contain at least one tuple `(x, y)` where `lmx[x] < y` is true.
   - Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this condition.

Given these points, the new state should be:

State: **`a` is a list of tuples where at least one tuple `(x, y)` satisfies `lmx[x] < y`, `lmn` and other variables remain unchanged.**
