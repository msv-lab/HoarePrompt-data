Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of tuples. At least one tuple (x, y) satisfies lmn[x] < y. After executing the if-else block, if lmn[x] > y, `x` in the relevant tuple(s) is updated to `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005`, and lmn[x] is updated to y. If lmn[x] is not greater than y, the list `a` and other variables remain unchanged.***
