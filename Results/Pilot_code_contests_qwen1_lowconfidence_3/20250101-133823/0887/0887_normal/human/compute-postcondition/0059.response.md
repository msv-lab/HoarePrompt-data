Output State: **`rmn[i]` is equal to the minimum value in the list `rmn` for all `i` from 0 to 200008, `rmx[i]` is unchanged for all `i`, `i` is 0.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `rmn` is a non-increasing list.
   - `lmn` is a shallow copy of `rmn`.
   - `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
   - `i` is initialized to 200009.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs in reverse order from 200009 to 1 (decrementing by 1 each time).
   - For each iteration, the loop checks if `rmn[i-1]` is greater than `rmn[i]`.
   - If the condition `rmn[i-1] > rmn[i]` is true, then `rmn[i-1]` is set to `rmn[i]`.

3. **Behavior Analysis:**
   - The loop continues to iterate until `i` reaches 0.
   - By the end of the loop, every element `rmn[i]` for `i` from 0 to 200008 will be equal to the minimum value in the list `rmn` because the loop ensures that any larger element is replaced with the smaller one when the condition is met.
   - The condition `rmn[i-1] > rmn[i]` can only be true if the element at `i-1` is greater than the element at `i`. Once this condition is met, the element at `i-1` is updated to the value of `rmn[i]`, making it smaller or equal. This process repeats until no such pairs exist, ensuring that all elements are equal to the minimum value.
   - The value of `i` will be 0 after the loop completes.

4. **Final State:**
   - All elements in `rmn` are equal to the minimum value of the list `rmn`.
   - The list `rmx` remains unchanged.
   - The variable `i` is set to 0.

This final state is reached regardless of whether the loop iterates fully or partially based on the condition.
