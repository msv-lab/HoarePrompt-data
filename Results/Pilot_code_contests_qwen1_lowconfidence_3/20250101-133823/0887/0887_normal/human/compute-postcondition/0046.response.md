The code `lmx[i + 1] = lmx[i]` updates the value of `lmx[i + 1]` to be equal to `lmx[i]`. Since `i` is 200009, this means that `lmx[200010]` is now equal to `lmx[200009]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lmn` is a non-increasing list, `lmx` is in its previous state with `lmx[200010]` equal to `lmx[200009]`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 200009**
