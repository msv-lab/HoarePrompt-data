The code `lmn[i] = rmn[i]` assigns the value of `rmn[i]` to `lmn[i]`. However, since `i` is specified as 1 in the initial state and no values for `lmn` or `rmn` are provided, we can assume that both `lmn` and `rmn` are lists and `i` is an index within these lists. Given that `i` is 1, the value at index 1 of `rmn` is copied to the same index of `lmn`.

Since the initial state only specifies that `i` is 1 and does not provide the values of `lmn` and `rmn`, we can only state that the value at index 1 of `rmn` is now also present at index 1 of `lmn`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `lmn[1]` is equal to `rmn[1]`**
