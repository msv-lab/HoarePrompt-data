Output State: **`lmn` is a list such that for all indices `i` (0 ≤ i < len(lmn) - 1), `lmn[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `lmn[i]`; `lmx` is in its previous state; `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`; `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`; `i` is 200008.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 199998` (since `range(200009)` generates numbers from 0 to 200008).
   - For each iteration, the condition `lmn[i + 1] > lmn[i]` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, `lmn[i + 1]` remains unchanged.
   - If the condition is false, `lmn[i + 1]` remains unchanged as well because the loop body doesn't modify it.

2. **Effect of the Loop**:
   - The loop essentially checks whether the next element in `lmn` is greater than the current element.
   - If it is, the next element remains unchanged.
   - If it is not, the next element also remains unchanged.
   - Therefore, after all iterations, the list `lmn` will be such that for all consecutive elements `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]` (where `0 ≤ i < len(lmn) - 1`), `lmn[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `lmn[i]`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After 200009 iterations, the loop variable `i` will be 200008.
   - The state of `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx` remains unchanged from their initial state since no modifications are made inside the loop body.

4. **No Execution Case**:
   - If the loop does not execute (which is impossible since it always runs from 0 to 199998), the initial state of `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx` would still hold, but this scenario is not applicable here as the loop always runs.
