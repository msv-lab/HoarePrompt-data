Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variable and its initial value**: The loop uses `i` as the loop variable and it starts from 0 (as `xrange(n)` generates values from 0 to `n-1`).

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 because `xrange(n)` will generate values only if `n` is a positive integer.

3. **List the relevant states that need adjustment**: 
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - `i` will start at 0 and increment with each iteration.

Given these points, we can summarize the necessary adjustments:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
