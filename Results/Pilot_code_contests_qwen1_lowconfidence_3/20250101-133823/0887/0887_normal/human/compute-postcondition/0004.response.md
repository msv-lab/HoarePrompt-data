`i` is incremented by 1 (since `i = 0` initially, `i * 2` is 0 and `i * 2 + 2` is 2, thus `dat[0:2]` is sliced), and `x, y = dat[0:2]` assigns the first two elements of `dat` to `x` and `y`. The values of `n` and `i` are updated as a result of this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is the first element of `dat`, `y` is the second element of `dat`**
