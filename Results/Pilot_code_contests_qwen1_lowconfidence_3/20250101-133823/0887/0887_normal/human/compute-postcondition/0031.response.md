Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `lmn` is in its previous state, with the second element equal to the first element.
- `lmx` is in its previous state.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
- `i` is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(200009):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 200008`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

### New State:
- After incrementing `i` by 1, `i` will be 1.

### States to Adjust:
- `lmn` remains in its previous state, with the second element equal to the first element.
- `lmx` remains in its previous state.
- `rmn` remains a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` remains a shallow copy of `lmx`.
- `i` is now 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`lmn` is in its previous state, with the second element equal to the first element; `lmx` is in its previous state; `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`; `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`; `i` is 1**.
