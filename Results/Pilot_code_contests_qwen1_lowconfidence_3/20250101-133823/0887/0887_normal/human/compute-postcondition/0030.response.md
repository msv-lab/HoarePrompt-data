Postcondition: ***`lmn` is in its previous state, with the second element equal to the first element; `lmx` is in its previous state; `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`; `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`; `i` is 0. This remains true regardless of whether the condition `lmn[i + 1] > lmn[i]` is satisfied or not.***
