The code `rmn = lmn[:]` creates a shallow copy of the list `lmn` and assigns it to `rmn`. This operation does not affect the values of `a`, `lmn`, or `lmx`. Therefore, the states of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples that may or may not have had their x values updated based on the condition `lmx[x] < y` for each tuple `(x, y)` in `a`; `lmn` is equal to its previous state; `lmx` is equal to its previous state; `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.**
