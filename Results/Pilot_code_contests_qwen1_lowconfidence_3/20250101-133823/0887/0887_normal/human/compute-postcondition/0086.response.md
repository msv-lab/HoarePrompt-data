According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 200010.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 0.
- For all `i` from 0 to 200008, if `lmx[i] > rmx[i]`, then `lmn[i]` is equal to `rmn[i]`. Otherwise, `lmn[i]` remains equal to `rmn[i]` as it was initially.

Since `i` is currently 0, the condition `i < 200010` is true, meaning the loop can execute again. After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1.

The state needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`i` is 1, and for all `i` from 0 to 200008, if `lmx[i] > rmx[i]`, then `lmn[i]` is equal to `rmn[i]`. Otherwise, `lmn[i]` remains equal to `rmn[i]` as it was initially.**
