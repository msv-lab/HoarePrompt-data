The code assigns the value of `rmn[i]` to `lmn[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `lmn[2]` is now equal to `rmn[2]`. The condition `lmn[1] < rmn[1]` must still hold true, and the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `lmn[2]` is equal to `rmn[2]`; `lmn[1] < rmn[1]` is still true**
