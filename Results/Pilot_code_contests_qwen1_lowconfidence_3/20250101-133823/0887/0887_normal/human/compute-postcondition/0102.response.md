The code `lmn[i] = lmn[i + 1]` assigns the value of `lmn[i + 1]` to `lmn[i]`. The initial state tells us that at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`. This means that `i` in the current context refers to `i + 1` from the next iteration.

Given this, the value of `lmn[i]` (which corresponds to the value of `lmn[i + 1]` from the next iteration) is now updated to be equal to `lmn[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`lmn[i]` is equal to `lmn[i + 1]` and the condition for the next iteration is `i < 200009`.**
