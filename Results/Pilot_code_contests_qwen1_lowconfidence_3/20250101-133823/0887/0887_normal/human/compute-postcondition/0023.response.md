Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of tuples. If there exists at least one tuple (x, y) in `a` such that `lmx[x] < y`, then `x` in the relevant tuple(s) is updated to `((x - 1) / 2 + 100005)`, and `lmn[x]` is updated to `y`. If no such tuple exists or `lmx[x]` is not less than `y`, the list `a` and other variables remain unchanged.***
