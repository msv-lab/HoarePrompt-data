Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `i` is 200008
   - `rmx[i-1]` equals `rmx[i]` after the operation

2. **Loop Definition**: The for loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in xrange(200009, 0, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop iterates over values of `i` from 200009 down to 1. Therefore, at the start of each iteration, `i` is decremented by 1.

4. **Current Value of `i`**: After the previous iteration, `i` is 200008. This means the loop just finished its execution for `i = 200008`.

5. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1. Thus, `i` should be 200007 at the start of the next iteration.

6. **Condition in the Loop**: The condition `rmx[i-1] == rmx[i]` was true at the end of the previous iteration. Since the loop decrements `i`, this condition will be checked again with `i` now being 200007. Specifically, it will check if `rmx[200006] == rmx[200007]`.

7. **Adjusted State**: The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**Final State**:
- `i` is 200007
- The condition `rmx[i-1] == rmx[i]` needs to be checked, which translates to checking `rmx[200006] == rmx[200007]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 200007, and `rmx[200006]` equals `rmx[200007]` after the operation**
