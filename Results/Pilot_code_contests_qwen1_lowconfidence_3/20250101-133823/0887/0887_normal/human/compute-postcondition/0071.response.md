Let's analyze the given problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute based on the provided initial state and the behavior of the loop.

### Initial State
- `rmn[i]` is equal to the minimum value in the list `rmn` for all `i` from 0 to 200008.
- `rmx[i]` is unchanged for all `i`.
- `i` is 0.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in xrange(200010):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Observations from Provided Output States
- The loop iterates from `i=0` to `i=200009`.
- Each iteration updates the value of `rmx[i]` based on the comparison with `rmx[i+1]`.

### General Pattern
The loop runs for `i` from 0 to 200009, updating `rmx[i]` to ensure that `rmx[i]` holds the maximum value up to index `i+1`.

### Final State Analysis
After the loop completes, `i` will be 200009. At this point, the value of `rmx[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 200009 will be the maximum value among all `rmx[i]` for `i` from 0 to 200009.

### Output State
- `i` will be 200009.
- For all `i` from 0 to 200009, `rmx[i]` will hold the maximum value of `rmx[i]` for `i` from 0 to 200009.

### Adjustments Needed for the Loop to Execute
To ensure the loop executes correctly, we need to set the initial state such that the loop condition `i < 200010` is satisfied.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Initial Value of `i`:** The initial value of `i` is 0.
2. **Loop Condition:** The loop runs as long as `i < 200010`.
3. **Final Value of `i`:** After the loop completes, `i` will be 200009.

Given that the loop runs from `i=0` to `i=200009`, the initial state needs to ensure that the loop starts with `i=0` and ends when `i=200009`.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is 0**

This is the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute as expected.
