Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `200009` down to `1`.
   - We are given that `rmn[i-1]` and `rmn[i]` are elements of the list `rmn`.
   - After the execution of the if statement, `rmn[i-1]` is equal to `rmn[i]`.
   - If `rmn[i-1]` was initially greater than `rmn[i]`, this inequality is no longer true.

2. **Determine the new state after the if statement:**
   - Since `rmn[i-1]` was initially greater than `rmn[i]` but now they are equal, we know that the if statement must have changed the value of `rmn[i-1]` to `rmn[i]`.

3. **Consider the loop condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than `0`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `1` (since the loop decrements `i`).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - The loop will decrement `i` from `1` to `0`.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `0` in the next iteration.

5. **Update the state of `rmn`:**
   - Given that `rmn[i-1]` and `rmn[i]` are equal after the if statement, the updated state of `rmn` remains the same for both `i-1` and `i`.

Based on the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`rmn[i-1]` and `rmn[i]` are elements of the list `rmn` and are equal, and `i` is 0**.
