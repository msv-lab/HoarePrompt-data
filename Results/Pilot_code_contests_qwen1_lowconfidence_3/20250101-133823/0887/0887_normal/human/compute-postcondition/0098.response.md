Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `lmn` array is defined and contains updated values.
- `lmx` and `rmx` arrays are defined and contain appropriate values.
- `ans` is 0.
- If `lmn[i]` is less than `lmn[i + 1]`, then `lmn[i]` is now equal to `lmn[i + 1]`. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

### For Loop
```python
for i in xrange(200009):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 200008 (since `xrange(200009)` means it runs from 0 to 200008 inclusive). The condition inside the loop modifies `lmn[i]` if `lmn[i] < lmn[i + 1]`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment of States
1. **Determine the Value of `i` at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - If the loop just finished its previous iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration would be `i + 1`.

2. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop condition checks `lmn[i] < lmn[i + 1]`. If this condition holds true, `lmn[i]` will be updated to `lmn[i + 1]`.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop is about to start its next iteration, we need to consider the value of `i` being incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `lmn[i]` might be updated based on the condition `lmn[i] < lmn[i + 1]`. However, without knowing the exact values of `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`, we cannot specify the exact new value of `lmn[i]`.

Given the information, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- The value of `lmn[i]` might change based on the condition `lmn[i] < lmn[i + 1]`.

### Final Answer
State: **`lmn` array is defined and contains updated values, `lmx` and `rmx` arrays are defined and contain appropriate values, `ans` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `lmn[i]` might be equal to `lmn[i + 1]` if `lmn[i] < lmn[i + 1]` otherwise remains unchanged.**

Note: The exact value of `lmn[i]` cannot be specified without additional information about the contents of the `lmn` array.
