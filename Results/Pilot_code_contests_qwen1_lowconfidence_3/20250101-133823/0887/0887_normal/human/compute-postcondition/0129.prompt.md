You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the x and y coordinates of a black token's initial position. All coordinates are integers within the range \([-10^5, 10^5]\), and the positions are distinct.
def func_1(a):
    inf = 1001001001
    C = 400010
    lmn = [inf] * 400010
    lmx = [-inf] * 400010
    for (x, y) in a:
        x = (x - 1) / 2 + 100005
        
        if lmn[x] > y:
            lmn[x] = y
        
        if lmx[x] < y:
            lmx[x] = y
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a list of tuples that may or may not have had their x values updated based on the condition `lmx[x] < y` for each tuple `(x, y)` in `a`. For every tuple `(x, y)` in `a`, if `lmx[x]` was less than `y` before the update, `lmn[x]` will be set to `y` and `x` will be updated to `((x - 1) / 2 + 100005)`. The lists `lmn` and `lmx` are updated accordingly for the x values that meet the condition. If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `a` is an empty list), then `a`, `lmn`, and `lmx` remain in their initial states.
    rmn = lmn[:]
    rmx = lmx[:]
    for i in xrange(200009):
        if lmn[i + 1] > lmn[i]:
            lmn[i + 1] = lmn[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lmn` is a list such that for all indices `i` (0 ≤ i < len(lmn) - 1), `lmn[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `lmn[i]`; `lmx` is in its previous state; `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`; `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`; `i` is 200008.
    for i in xrange(200009):
        if lmx[i + 1] < lmx[i]:
            lmx[i + 1] = lmx[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lmn` is a non-increasing list, `lmx` is in its previous state with `lmx[i]` for all `i` unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 200009.
    for i in xrange(200009, 0, -1):
        if rmn[i - 1] > rmn[i]:
            rmn[i - 1] = rmn[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `rmn[i]` is equal to the minimum value in the list `rmn` for all `i` from 0 to 200008, `rmx[i]` is unchanged for all `i`, `i` is 0.
    for i in xrange(200009, 0, -1):
        if rmx[i - 1] < rmx[i]:
            rmx[i - 1] = rmx[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations have finished.
    #
    #### Initial State
    #- `rmn[i]` is equal to the minimum value in the list `rmn` for all `i` from 0 to 200008.
    #- `rmx[i]` is unchanged for all `i`.
    #- `i` is 0.
    #
    #### Loop Code
    #```python
    #for i in xrange(200009, 0, -1):
    #    if rmx[i - 1] < rmx[i]:
    #        rmx[i - 1] = rmx[i]
    #```
    #
    #### Observations from Provided Output States
    #- After 1 iteration (`i` is 200008): `rmx[200008]` equals `rmx[200009]`.
    #- After 2 iterations (`i` is 200007): `rmx[200006]` equals `rmx[200007]` and `rmx[200007]` equals `rmx[200008]`.
    #- After 3 iterations (`i` is 200006): `rmx[200005]` equals `rmx[200006]` and `rmx[200007]` equals `rmx[200006]`.
    #
    #### General Pattern
    #Each iteration updates `rmx[i-1]` to be equal to `rmx[i]` if the condition `rmx[i-1] < rmx[i]` is satisfied. This process continues until `i` reaches 1.
    #
    #### Final State Analysis
    #When the loop completes, `i` will be 1. At this point, the only value that hasn't been compared is `rmx[0]` and `rmx[1]`. However, since all subsequent values of `rmx` from `i=2` to `i=200008` have already been updated to be equal to the next higher index value, we need to consider the relationship between `rmx[0]` and `rmx[1]`.
    #
    #Since the loop ensures that each `rmx[i-1]` is updated to be equal to `rmx[i]` if `rmx[i-1] < rmx[i]`, and this process starts from `i=200009` down to `i=1`, the final state will ensure that `rmx[0]` is the maximum value among all `rmx[i]` for `i` from 1 to 200008.
    #
    #### Output State
    #After the loop completes, the value of `rmx[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 200008 will be equal to the maximum value of `rmx[i]` for all `i` from 1 to 200008. The variable `i` will be 1.
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #- `i` is 1.
    #- For all `i` from 0 to 200008, `rmx[i]` is the maximum value of `rmx[i]` for `i` from 1 to 200008.
    for i in xrange(200010):
        if lmn[i] < rmn[i]:
            lmn[i] = rmn[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: - `i` is 200009.
    #- For all `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmn[i]` is equal to `rmn[i]`.
    #
    #Output State:
    for i in xrange(200010):
        if lmx[i] > rmx[i]:
            lmx[i] = rmx[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: For all `i` from 0 to 200008, if `lmx[i] > rmx[i]`, then `lmn[i]` is equal to `rmn[i]` and `lmx[i]` is now equal to `rmx[i]`; otherwise, `lmn[i]` and `lmx[i]` remain unchanged as they were originally.
    ans = 0
    for i in xrange(200009):
        if lmn[i] < lmn[i + 1]:
            lmn[i] = lmn[i + 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lmn` array is such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200007), `lmn[i]` is the minimum value between `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmx` and `rmx` arrays are defined and contain appropriate values, `ans` is 0.

    for i in xrange(200009):
        if lmn[i] < lmx[i]:
            ans += (lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lmn` array remains such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200007), `lmn[i]` is the minimum value between `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmx` array remains such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200008), `lmx[i]` is equal to `lmx[i + 1]`, `rmx` array remains unchanged, and `ans` is the sum of `(lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2` for all `i` where `lmn[i] < lmx[i]` and the loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = 200008`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the sum of (lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2 for all i where lmn[i] < lmx[i] and the loop iterates from i = 0 to i = 200008
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`. `a` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the x and y coordinates of a black token's initial position. All coordinates are integers within the range \([-10^5, 10^5]\), and the positions are distinct.
#
#The function returns the sum of \((\text{lmx}[i] - \text{lmn}[i]) / 2\) for all \(i\) where \(\text{lmn}[i] < \text{lmx}[i]\) and the loop iterates from \(i = 0\) to \(i = 200008\).
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of tuples `a`, and return the sum of \((\text{lmx}[i] - \text{lmn}[i]) / 2\) for all valid indices \(i\) as described.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the sum of (lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2 for all i where lmn[i] < lmx[i] and the loop iterates from i = 0 to i = 200008


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
