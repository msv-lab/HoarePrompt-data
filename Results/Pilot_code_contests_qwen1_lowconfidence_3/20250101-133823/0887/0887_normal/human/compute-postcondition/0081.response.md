Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State
- `lmn[i]` is equal to the minimum value in the list `lmn` for all `i` from 0 to 200008.
- `rmn[i]` is unchanged for all `i`.
- `i` is 0.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(200010):
    if lmn[i] < rmn[i]:
        lmn[i] = rmn[i]
```

### Observations from Provided Output States
- After 1 iteration (`i` is 0): If `lmn[0] < rmn[0]`, then `lmn[0]` is updated to `rmn[0]`. Otherwise, `lmn[0]` remains unchanged.
- After 2 iterations (`i` is 1): If `lmn[1] < rmn[1]`, then `lmn[1]` is updated to `rmn[1]`. Otherwise, `lmn[1]` remains unchanged.
- After 3 iterations (`i` is 2): If `lmn[2] < rmn[2]`, then `lmn[2]` is updated to `rmn[2]`. Otherwise, `lmn[2]` remains unchanged.

### General Pattern
Each iteration updates `lmn[i]` to be equal to `rmn[i]` if the condition `lmn[i] < rmn[i]` is satisfied. This process continues until `i` reaches 200009.

### Final State Analysis
When the loop completes, `i` will be 200009. At this point, the only value that hasn't been compared is `lmn[200009]` and `rmn[200009]`. However, since all subsequent values of `lmn` from `i=0` to `i=200008` have already been updated to be equal to `rmn[i]` if `lmn[i] < rmn[i]`, the final state will ensure that `lmn[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 200008 is equal to `rmn[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 200008.

### Output State
After the loop completes, the value of `lmn[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 200008 will be equal to the corresponding value of `rmn[i]` for `i` from 0 to 200008. The variable `i` will be 200009.

**Output State:**
- `i` is 200009.
- For all `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmn[i]` is equal to `rmn[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is 200009, for all `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmn[i]` is equal to `rmn[i]`.**
