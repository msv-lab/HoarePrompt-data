Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State
- `rmn[i]` is equal to the minimum value in the list `rmn` for all `i` from 0 to 200008.
- `rmx[i]` is unchanged for all `i`.
- `i` is 0.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in xrange(200009, 0, -1):
    if rmx[i - 1] < rmx[i]:
        rmx[i - 1] = rmx[i]
```

### Observations from Provided Output States
- After 1 iteration (`i` is 200008): `rmx[200008]` equals `rmx[200009]`.
- After 2 iterations (`i` is 200007): `rmx[200006]` equals `rmx[200007]` and `rmx[200007]` equals `rmx[200008]`.
- After 3 iterations (`i` is 200006): `rmx[200005]` equals `rmx[200006]` and `rmx[200007]` equals `rmx[200006]`.

### General Pattern
Each iteration updates `rmx[i-1]` to be equal to `rmx[i]` if the condition `rmx[i-1] < rmx[i]` is satisfied. This process continues until `i` reaches 1.

### Final State Analysis
When the loop completes, `i` will be 1. At this point, the only value that hasn't been compared is `rmx[0]` and `rmx[1]`. However, since all subsequent values of `rmx` from `i=2` to `i=200008` have already been updated to be equal to the next higher index value, we need to consider the relationship between `rmx[0]` and `rmx[1]`.

Since the loop ensures that each `rmx[i-1]` is updated to be equal to `rmx[i]` if `rmx[i-1] < rmx[i]`, and this process starts from `i=200009` down to `i=1`, the final state will ensure that `rmx[0]` is the maximum value among all `rmx[i]` for `i` from 1 to 200008.

### Output State
After the loop completes, the value of `rmx[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 200008 will be equal to the maximum value of `rmx[i]` for all `i` from 1 to 200008. The variable `i` will be 1.

**Output State:**
- `i` is 1.
- For all `i` from 0 to 200008, `rmx[i]` is the maximum value of `rmx[i]` for `i` from 1 to 200008.
