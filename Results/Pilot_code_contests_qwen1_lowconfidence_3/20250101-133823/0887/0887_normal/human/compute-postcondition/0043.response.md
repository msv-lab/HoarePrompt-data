The code snippet `lmx[i + 1] = lmx[i]` updates the value of `lmx[i + 1]` to be the same as `lmx[i]`. Given the initial state, `lmx[i + 1]` was already equal to `lmx[i]` (as mentioned), so this operation does not change their values.

The states of the other variables (`lmn`, `rmn`, `rmx`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lmn` is a non-increasing list, `lmx` is in its previous state with `lmx[i + 1]` equal to `lmx[i]`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 200009**
