Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` and a flat sequence of 2*n integers representing the coordinates of black tokens from standard input. It processes these coordinates to group them into two lists based on whether the sum of the coordinates (x + y) is even or odd. Specifically, it creates a list `s` containing two sublists: the first sublist contains tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` for even sums, and the second sublist contains tuples for odd sums. Finally, it prints the sum of the outputs of `func_1` applied to these two sublists.**

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `n` is 0, the function will still read the input but will not enter the loop since `n` is the upper limit of the loop range. The function will then print the result of `func_1([]) + func_1([])`, which is likely to be 0 if `func_1` handles empty lists appropriately.

Missing Functionality:
- The code assumes that `func_1` is defined and can handle the input correctly. If `func_1` is not defined or does not handle certain types of inputs correctly, this could lead to undefined behavior. Additionally, the code does not provide any error handling for invalid input (e.g., non-integer values in the input stream).

Final State of the Program:
- `n`: A non-negative integer representing the number of black tokens.
- `dat`: Unchanged, as it is only read during the loop and not modified.
- `s`: A list containing two sublists. The first sublist contains tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` for even sums of coordinates, and the second sublist contains tuples for odd sums.
