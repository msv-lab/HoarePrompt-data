The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. The initial state specifies conditions for updating `lmn[i]` and `lmx[i]` based on the comparison between `lmx[i]` and `rmx[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 200008. However, the given code does not modify these variables; it only initializes `ans`. Therefore, the values of `lmn[i]` and `lmx[i]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **For all `i` from 0 to 200008, if `lmx[i] > rmx[i]`, then `lmn[i]` is equal to `rmn[i]` and `lmx[i]` is now equal to `rmx[i]`; otherwise, `lmn[i]` and `lmx[i]` remain unchanged as they were originally. `ans` is 0.**
