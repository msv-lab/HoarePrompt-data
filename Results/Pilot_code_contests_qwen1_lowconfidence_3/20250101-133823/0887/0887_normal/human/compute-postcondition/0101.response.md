Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration.
   - If `lmn[i]` is less than `lmn[i + 1]`, then `lmn[i]` is updated to `lmn[i + 1]`.
   - There is no other change in the values of `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]` in the else case.

2. **Current State:**
   - We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition for the next iteration is whether `i` is less than 200009 (since the loop runs from 0 to 200008).
   - If `i` is less than 200009, the loop will continue; otherwise, it will terminate.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The variable `i` will be incremented to `i + 1`.
   - The array `lmn` remains unchanged unless the condition `lmn[i] < lmn[i + 1]` is true, in which case `lmn[i]` is updated to `lmn[i + 1]`.

5. **Final State:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the next iteration is `i < 200009`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `lmn` remains unchanged unless `lmn[i] < lmn[i + 1]` in which case `lmn[i]` is updated to `lmn[i + 1]`, and the condition for the loop to execute again is `i < 200009`**.
