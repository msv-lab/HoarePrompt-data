Postcondition: ***`lmn` array remains such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200007), `lmn[i]` is the minimum value between `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`; `lmx` array is updated such that `lmx[i]` is now equal to `lmx[i + 1]`; `rmx` array remains unchanged; `ans` is 0; `i` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.***
