In the given initial state, `a` is a list of tuples, and there exists at least one tuple `(x, y)` such that `lmn[x] < y`. The code snippet updates `lmx[x]` to `y`.

Let's analyze the impact:

1. **Check the Condition**: The condition `lmn[x] < y` must be true for the tuple `(x, y)` in `a` to be updated.
2. **Update the Tuple**: If the condition is true, the tuple `(x, y)` is updated to `((x - 1) / 2 + 100005, y)`.
3. **No Update if Condition Fails**: If the condition `lmn[x] > y` is false (which it won't be since the condition `lmn[x] < y` is true), no changes are made.

Given this analysis, only the specific tuple `(x, y)` in the list `a` is updated according to the rule. All other tuples in `a` remain unchanged. The variables `lmn` and `lmx` also get updated for the specific `x` where the condition holds.

Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples, at least one of which is updated to `((x - 1) / 2 + 100005, y)`, `lmn[x]` is updated to `y`, and `lmx[x]` is updated to `y`.**
