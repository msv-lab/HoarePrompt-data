The function `func_2` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads `n` (an integer representing the number of black tokens) and `dat` (a flat sequence of 2*n integers representing the coordinates of each black token) from standard input. Based on this input, the function does not return anything explicitly mentioned, but its functionality can be described as reading the number of black tokens and their coordinates from standard input and processing them accordingly.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a flat sequence of 2*n integers representing the coordinates of black tokens from standard input, and processes these inputs.**
