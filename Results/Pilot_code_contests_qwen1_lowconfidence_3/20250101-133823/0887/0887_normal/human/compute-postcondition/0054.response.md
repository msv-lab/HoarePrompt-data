The code updates `rmn[i - 1]` with the value of `rmn[i]`. Given the initial state where `rmn[i-1]` and `rmn[i]` are equal and `i` is 0, `rmn[i - 1]` (which is `rmn[-1]`) will be updated to the value of `rmn[0]`. Since `rmn[i-1]` and `rmn[i]` were initially equal, this update doesn't change their equality. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `rmn[-1]` is equal to `rmn[0]`, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`rmn[-1]` is equal to `rmn[0]`, and `i` is 0**
