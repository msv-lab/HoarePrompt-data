Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples that may or may not have had their x values updated based on the condition `lmx[x] < y` for each tuple `(x, y)` in `a`. For every tuple `(x, y)` in `a`, if `lmx[x]` was less than `y` before the update, `lmn[x]` will be set to `y` and `x` will be updated to `((x - 1) / 2 + 100005)`. The lists `lmn` and `lmx` are updated accordingly for the x values that meet the condition. If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `a` is an empty list), then `a`, `lmn`, and `lmx` remain in their initial states.**
