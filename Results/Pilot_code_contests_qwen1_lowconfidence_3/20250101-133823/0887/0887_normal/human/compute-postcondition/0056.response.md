According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 200009 down to 1. The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `rmn[i-1]` and `rmn[i]` are elements of the list `rmn` and are equal.
- `i` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1 (since the loop increments `i` in each iteration), making `i` equal to 199998.

The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we only need to update `i` to 199998.

State: **`rmn[i-1]` and `rmn[i]` are elements of the list `rmn` and are equal, and `i` is 199998**
