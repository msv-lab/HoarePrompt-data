You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?


Example Answer 1:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?


Example Answer 2:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State
- `rmn[i]` is equal to the minimum value in the list `rmn` for all `i` from 0 to 200008.
- `rmx[i]` is unchanged for all `i`.
- `i` is 0.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in xrange(200009, 0, -1):
    if rmx[i - 1] < rmx[i]:
        rmx[i - 1] = rmx[i]
```

### Observations from Provided Output States
- After 1 iteration (`i` is 200008): `rmx[200008]` equals `rmx[200009]`.
- After 2 iterations (`i` is 200007): `rmx[200006]` equals `rmx[200007]` and `rmx[200007]` equals `rmx[200008]`.
- After 3 iterations (`i` is 200006): `rmx[200005]` equals `rmx[200006]` and `rmx[200007]` equals `rmx[200006]`.

### General Pattern
Each iteration updates `rmx[i-1]` to be equal to `rmx[i]` if the condition `rmx[i-1] < rmx[i]` is satisfied. This process continues until `i` reaches 1.

### Final State Analysis
When the loop completes, `i` will be 1. At this point, the only value that hasn't been compared is `rmx[0]` and `rmx[1]`. However, since all subsequent values of `rmx` from `i=2` to `i=200008` have already been updated to be equal to the next higher index value, we need to consider the relationship between `rmx[0]` and `rmx[1]`.

Since the loop ensures that each `rmx[i-1]` is updated to be equal to `rmx[i]` if `rmx[i-1] < rmx[i]`, and this process starts from `i=200009` down to `i=1`, the final state will ensure that `rmx[0]` is the maximum value among all `rmx[i]` for `i` from 1 to 200008.

### Output State
After the loop completes, the value of `rmx[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 200008 will be equal to the maximum value of `rmx[i]` for all `i` from 1 to 200008. The variable `i` will be 1.

**Output State:**
- `i` is 1.
- For all `i` from 0 to 200008, `rmx[i]` is the maximum value of `rmx[i]` for `i` from 1 to 200008.
```
for i in xrange(200010):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?
