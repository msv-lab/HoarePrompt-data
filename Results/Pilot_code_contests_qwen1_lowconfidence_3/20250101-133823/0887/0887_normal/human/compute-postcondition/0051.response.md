The code sets `rmn[i - 1]` equal to `rmn[i]`. According to the initial state, `rmn[i-1]` is greater than `rmn[i]`. After executing the line of code, `rmn[i-1]` will no longer be greater than `rmn[i]` because they are now equal. The relationship between the two elements of the list `rmn` is updated to equality.

Output State: **`rmn[i-1]` is equal to `rmn[i]`; the overall relationship between these two elements of the list `rmn` is now equality instead of `rmn[i-1]` being greater than `rmn[i]`.**
