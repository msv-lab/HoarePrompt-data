Postcondition: ***`lmn` array remains such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200007), `lmn[i]` is the minimum value between `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmx` array is updated such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200008), `lmx[i]` is equal to `lmx[i + 1]`, `rmx` array remains unchanged, `ans` is 0, and the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 200008`. Additionally, for the current iteration of the loop, `lmn[i]` is less than `lmx[i]`***
