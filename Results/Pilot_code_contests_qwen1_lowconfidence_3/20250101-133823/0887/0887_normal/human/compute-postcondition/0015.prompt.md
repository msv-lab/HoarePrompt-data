You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: `n` is an integer representing the number of black tokens, and `dat` is an iterable containing pairs of integers representing the x and y coordinates of each black token. The tokens' coordinates are read from standard input in a way that `dat` is a flat sequence of 2*n integers, with each pair of integers representing the coordinates of one black token.
def func_2():
    n = int(stdin.readline())
    dat = map(int, stdin.read().split(), repeat(10, 2 * n))
    s = [[], []]
    for i in xrange(n):
        x, y = dat[i * 2:i * 2 + 2]
        
        s[x + y & 1].append((-x + y, x + y))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.
    #
    #### Loop Code Analysis
    #The loop iterates over the range from 0 to \( n-1 \). For each iteration \( i \), it extracts two elements from the `dat` list and assigns them to `x` and `y`. It then appends a tuple `(-x + y, x + y)` to the appropriate list in `s` based on the condition `x + y & 1`.
    #
    #### Iteration Details
    #- **First Iteration (i=0):**
    #  - `x` is `dat[0]`
    #  - `y` is `dat[1]`
    #  - `s[x + y & 1]` is updated with the tuple `(-dat[0] + dat[1], dat[0] + dat[1])`
    #
    #- **Second Iteration (i=1):**
    #  - `x` is `dat[2]`
    #  - `y` is `dat[3]`
    #  - `s[x + y & 1]` is updated with the tuple `(-dat[2] + dat[3], dat[2] + dat[3])`
    #
    #- **Third Iteration (i=2):**
    #  - `x` is `dat[4]`
    #  - `y` is `dat[5]`
    #  - `s[x + y & 1]` is updated with the tuple `(-dat[4] + dat[5], dat[4] + dat[5])`
    #
    #### General Pattern
    #- After the loop finishes, the `s` list will contain two sublists where each sublist contains tuples of the form `(-x + y, x + y)` depending on whether `x + y` is even or odd.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #Since the loop will execute exactly \( n \) times if `n > 0`, the final state of the variables will be as follows:
    #
    #- `n` will be the number of black tokens, and `n` must be a non-negative integer.
    #- `dat` will remain unchanged, as it is only read from during the loop.
    #- `s` will be a list containing two sublists. Each sublist will contain tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` where `x` and `y` are the coordinates of the black tokens such that `x + y` is even or odd respectively.
    #
    #### Output State
    #**Output State:**
    #``n` is a non-negative integer, `dat` is an iterable of integers representing the coordinates of each black token, `s` is a list containing two sublists where the first sublist contains tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` for even `x + y` and the second sublist contains tuples for odd `x + y`.
    #```
    print(func_1(s[0]) + func_1(s[1]))
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads an integer `n` and a flat sequence of 2*n integers representing the coordinates of black tokens from standard input, and processes these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
