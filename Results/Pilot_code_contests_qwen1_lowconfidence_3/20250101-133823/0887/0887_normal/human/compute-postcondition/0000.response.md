The code reads an integer `n` from standard input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means that `n` now holds the value of the number of black tokens, and the list `dat` remains unchanged as it was already defined before this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of black tokens, and `dat` is an iterable containing pairs of integers representing the x and y coordinates of each black token. The tokens' coordinates are read from standard input in a way that `dat` is a flat sequence of 2*n integers, with each pair of integers representing the coordinates of one black token. The value of `n` is now set to the integer read from standard input.**
