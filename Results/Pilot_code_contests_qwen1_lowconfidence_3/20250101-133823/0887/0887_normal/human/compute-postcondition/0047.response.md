Postcondition: ***`lmn` is a non-increasing list, `lmx` is in its previous state with `lmx[200010]` equal to `lmx[200009]`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 200009. If `lmx[200010] < lmx[200009]`, this condition holds true. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged regardless of the condition evaluation.***
