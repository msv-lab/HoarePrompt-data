The code sets `lmx[i]` to the value of `rmx[i]`. Given that `lmx[i]` was originally greater than `rmx[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 200008, this assignment will make `lmx[i]` equal to `rmx[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 200008. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `lmn[i]` is equal to `rmn[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 200008, and the current value of `lmx[i]` is equal to `rmx[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 200008**
