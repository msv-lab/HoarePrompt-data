To determine the state adjustments needed at the start of the next iteration of the for loop, we need to consider how each variable changes or is used within the loop. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Loop Variable `i`:**
   - The loop runs from `0` to `200009`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `200008`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by `1`, making it `200009`.

2. **Arrays `lmn`, `lmx`, and `rmx`:**
   - These arrays remain unchanged according to the given information.
   - Therefore, `lmn` and `lmx` still follow their respective conditions (min values and equal values), and `rmx` remains unchanged.

3. **Variable `ans`:**
   - `ans` is updated based on the condition `lmn[200008] < lmx[200008]`.
   - Since `i` is about to be incremented to `200009`, the check for the update of `ans` will be `lmn[200009] < lmx[200009]`.
   - However, since no changes were mentioned to these arrays, the conditions `lmn[200009]` and `lmx[200009]` remain as they were before the loop started.

Given the above considerations, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the loop variable `i`.

**State: **`lmn` array remains such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200007), `lmn[i]` is the minimum value between `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmx` array remains such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200008), `lmx[i]` is equal to `lmx[i + 1]`, `rmx` array remains unchanged, and `ans` is increased by `(lmx[200008] - lmn[200008]) / 2` if `lmn[200008] < lmx[200008]` if `lmn[i] < lmx[i]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, and `i` is 200009**.
