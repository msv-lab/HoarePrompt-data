The code updates `lmx[i]` to be equal to `lmx[i + 1]`. Given the initial state, `lmx[i + 1]` is the same as its original value before this operation. The values of `lmn`, `rmx`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lmn[i]` is the minimum value between `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`; `lmx[i]` is equal to `lmx[i + 1]`; `rmx` array remains unchanged; `ans` is 0; `i` is `k + 2`**
