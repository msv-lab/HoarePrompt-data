The code snippet `lmx[i] = rmx[i]` assigns the value of `rmx[i]` to `lmx[i]`. Given the initial state, the condition for `lmn[i]` being equal to `rmn[i]` or not does not affect this assignment because the assignment happens unconditionally for all `i` from 0 to 200008. The initial state specifies that for all `i` from 0 to 200008, if `lmx[i] > rmx[i]`, then `lmn[i]` is equal to `rmn[i]`. However, the code changes the value of `lmx[i]` to `rmx[i]` regardless of this condition.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `lmn[i]` and `rmn[i]`, we can only update the value of `lmx[i]` to be the same as `rmx[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 200008.

Output State: **`lmn[i]` is equal to `rmn[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 200008; `lmx[i]` is now equal to `rmx[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 200008**
