`lmx[i]` is assigned the value of `lmx[i + 1]`. The value of `lmx[i + 1]` was previously defined in the initial state, and now `lmx[i]` takes on that same value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `lmn` array is such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200007), `lmn[i]` is the minimum value between `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmx` and `rmx` arrays are defined and contain appropriate values, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `lmx[i]` is equal to `lmx[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`lmn` array is such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200007), `lmn[i]` is the minimum value between `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmx` and `rmx` arrays are defined and contain appropriate values, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `lmx[i]` is equal to `lmx[i + 1]`.**
