Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 200007.
   - `rmx[200006]` equals `rmx[200007]`.
   - The condition to check: If `rmx[200006]` is less than `rmx[200007]`, then `rmx[200006]` is assigned the value of `rmx[200007]`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in xrange(200009, 0, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts from `200009` and decrements `i` by 1 until it reaches `0`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 200007.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `200006`.

5. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The condition to check in the loop body is if `rmx[200006]` is less than `rmx[200007]`.
   - According to the initial state, `rmx[200006]` equals `rmx[200007]`, so the condition will not be met (since `rmx[200006]` is not less than `rmx[200007]`).

6. **Update the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the condition is not met, the value of `rmx[200006]` remains unchanged.
   - Therefore, `i` becomes `200006`.

Given this analysis, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 200006, and `rmx[200006]` equals `rmx[200007]`.**
