According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `0` to `200009` (since `xrange` is inclusive of the start and exclusive of the stop value). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1.

The condition `lmn[1] < rmn[1]` must hold true for the loop to continue. Since it is given that `lmn[1] < rmn[1]` is true, there is no change required for this condition.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.

State: **`i` is 2, and the condition `lmn[1] < rmn[1]` must still hold true.**
