Step-by-step analysis:
- Initially, `lmn` has its second element equal to the first element.
- The code `lmn[i + 1] = lmn[i]` implies that the element at index `i + 1` in `lmn` is being set to the value of the element at index `i`.
- Given `i` is 1, this translates to `lmn[2] = lmn[1]`.
- Since `lmn[1]` is equal to `lmn[2]` (from the initial state), `lmn[2]` will be reassigned to itself, effectively no change.

Output State: **`lmn` is in its previous state, with the second element equal to the first element; `lmx` is in its previous state; `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`; `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`; `i` is 1**
