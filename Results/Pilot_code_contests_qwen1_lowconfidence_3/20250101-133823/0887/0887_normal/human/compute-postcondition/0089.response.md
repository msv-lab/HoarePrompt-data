According to the code, the loop iterates over `i` from 0 to 200009 (since `xrange` is inclusive of the start and exclusive of the stop value). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and the condition for updating `lmn[i]` based on `lmx[i]` and `rmx[i]` has been applied for all `i` from 0 to 200008.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. The loop will increment `i` by 1, so `i` will become 2.
2. The condition for updating `lmn[i]` based on `lmx[i]` and `rmx[i]` will be checked for `i = 2`.
3. Since the condition applies for all `i` from 0 to 200008, it will continue to apply for `i = 2` if the same logic holds.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` is now 2, and the condition for updating `lmn[i]` based on `lmx[i]` and `rmx[i]` will be applied for `i = 2`.

State: **`i` is 2, and for all `i` from 0 to 200008, if `lmx[i] > rmx[i]`, then `lmn[i]` is equal to `rmn[i]`. Otherwise, `lmn[i]` remains equal to `rmn[i]` as it was initially.**
