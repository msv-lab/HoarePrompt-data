According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to 200010. The condition for the loop to continue executing depends on the value of `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `i` is 0
- If `lmn[i]` is less than `rmn[i]`, the relationship remains unchanged. If `lmn[i]` is not less than `rmn[i]`, no change occurs.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

The relationship between `lmn[i]` and `rmn[i]` does not change based on the loop iteration; it only changes if a certain condition is met within the loop body. Since we are only asked to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to consider the relationship explicitly here.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1**
