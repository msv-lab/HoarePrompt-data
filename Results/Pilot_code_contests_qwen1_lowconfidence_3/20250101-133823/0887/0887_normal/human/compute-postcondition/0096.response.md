The code updates the value of `lmn[i]` to be equal to the value of `lmn[i + 1]`. The precondition states that the current value of `lmn[i]` is less than the value of `lmn[i + 1]`. After executing the line `lmn[i] = lmn[i + 1]`, the value of `lmn[i]` is now updated to be equal to the value of `lmn[i + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lmn[i]` is now equal to `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmx` and `rmx` arrays are defined and contain appropriate values, `lmn` array is defined and contains updated values, `ans` is 0.**
