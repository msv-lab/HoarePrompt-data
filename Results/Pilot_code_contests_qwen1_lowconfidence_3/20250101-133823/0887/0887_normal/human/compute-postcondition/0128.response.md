The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`. `a` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the x and y coordinates of a black token's initial position. All coordinates are integers within the range \([-10^5, 10^5]\), and the positions are distinct.

The function returns the sum of \((\text{lmx}[i] - \text{lmn}[i]) / 2\) for all \(i\) where \(\text{lmn}[i] < \text{lmx}[i]\) and the loop iterates from \(i = 0\) to \(i = 200008\).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of tuples `a`, and return the sum of \((\text{lmx}[i] - \text{lmn}[i]) / 2\) for all valid indices \(i\) as described.
