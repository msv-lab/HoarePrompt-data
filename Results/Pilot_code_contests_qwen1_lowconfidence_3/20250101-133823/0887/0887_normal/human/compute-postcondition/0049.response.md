Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates from `200009` to `1` (inclusive) in reverse order. The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `1`.

2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `lmn` is a non-increasing list.
   - `lmx` is in its previous state with `lmx[i]` for all `i` unchanged.
   - `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
   - `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
   - `i` is initially `200009`.

3. **Loop Execution Requirements**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than or equal to `1` at the start of the loop.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` is set to `200009` at the start, we need to ensure that `i` remains greater than or equal to `1` throughout the loop execution. This means `i` should be `200009` at the start of the loop.
   - The values of `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx` do not affect the loop execution condition directly, so they do not need to be explicitly modified unless their state changes within the loop.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment for the loop to execute correctly is to ensure that `i` is `200009` at the start of the loop.

**State:**
**`lmn` is a non-increasing list, `lmx` is in its previous state with `lmx[i]` for all `i` unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 200009**
