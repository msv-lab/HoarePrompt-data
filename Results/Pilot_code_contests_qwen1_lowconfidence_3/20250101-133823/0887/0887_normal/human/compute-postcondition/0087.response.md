The code snippet `lmx[i] = rmx[i]` assigns the value of `rmx[i]` to `lmx[i]`. According to the initial state, for all `i` from 0 to 200008, if `lmx[i] > rmx[i]`, then `lmn[i]` is equal to `rmn[i]`. However, since the code snippet sets `lmx[i]` to `rmx[i]`, the condition `lmx[i] > rmx[i]` is no longer true for this assignment. As a result, `lmn[i]` remains unchanged and is still equal to `rmn[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, for all `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmx[i]` is equal to `rmx[i]`, and `lmn[i]` remains equal to `rmn[i]`.**
