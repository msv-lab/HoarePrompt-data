Output State: **`lmn` array remains such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200007), `lmn[i]` is the minimum value between `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmx` array remains such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200008), `lmx[i]` is equal to `lmx[i + 1]`, `rmx` array remains unchanged, and `ans` is the sum of `(lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2` for all `i` where `lmn[i] < lmx[i]` and the loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = 200008`.**

### Explanation:
- **`lmn` array**: The condition `lmn[i]` is the minimum value between `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]` ensures that `lmn` array is always sorted in non-decreasing order up to index 200007.
- **`lmx` array**: The condition `lmx[i]` is equal to `lmx[i + 1]` indicates that `lmx` array is constant and does not change throughout the loop.
- **`rmx` array**: This array remains unchanged, meaning its state is the same as the initial state.
- **`ans`**: The variable `ans` accumulates the value `(lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2` whenever `lmn[i] < lmx[i]`. Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 200008`, `ans` is the sum of these increments over all valid `i`.

After the loop completes, `ans` contains the total sum of half the difference between `lmx[i]` and `lmn[i]` for each index `i` where `lmn[i] < lmx[i]` within the specified range.
