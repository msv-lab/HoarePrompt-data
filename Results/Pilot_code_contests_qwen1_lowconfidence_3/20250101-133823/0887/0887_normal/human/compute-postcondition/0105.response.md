State: **`lmn` array is such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200007), `lmn[i]` is the minimum value between `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmx` and `rmx` arrays are defined and contain appropriate values, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `i` must be less than 200009**

Let's break down the process:

1. **Loop Initialization**: The for loop iterates from `i` in the range `xrange(200009)`. This means the loop will start with `i = 0` and continue until `i < 200009`.

2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `lmn` array is initialized such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200007), `lmn[i]` is the minimum value between `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`.
   - `lmx` and `rmx` arrays are defined and contain appropriate values.
   - `ans` is initially set to 0.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 0.
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `i < 200009` must hold true. Therefore, `i` must be less than 200009.

Given this analysis, the necessary adjustments to the initial state are:

- `lmn` array is as described.
- `lmx` and `rmx` arrays are as described.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `i` must be less than 200009.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`lmn` array is such that for all valid `i` (0 to 200007), `lmn[i]` is the minimum value between `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmx` and `rmx` arrays are defined and contain appropriate values, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `i` must be less than 200009**
