Postcondition: ***`lmn` is a non-increasing list, `lmx` is in its previous state with `lmx[i + 1]` equal to `lmx[i]`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 200009. If `lmx[i + 1] < lmx[i]`, the condition is already satisfied and remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
