According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 200009. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 200008. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 200009.

The states `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx` remain unchanged because the if condition `lmx[i + 1] < lmx[i]` was false, and the program did not enter the if block or change these lists. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 200009.
- The conditions for `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx` remain the same since no changes occurred within the else block.

State: **`lmn` is a non-increasing list, `lmx` is in its previous state with `lmx[i + 1]` equal to `lmx[i]`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 200009**
