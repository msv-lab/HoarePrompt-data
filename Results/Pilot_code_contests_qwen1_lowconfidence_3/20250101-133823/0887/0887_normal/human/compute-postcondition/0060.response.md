Let's break down the given situation step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `rmn[i]` is set to the minimum value in the list `rmn` for all `i` from 0 to 200008.
   - `rmx[i]` is unchanged for all `i`.
   - `i` is initially set to 0.

2. **For Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over the range `xrange(200009, 0, -1)`. This means `i` will take values starting from 200008 down to 1 (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must start from 200008 and go down to 1. Since `i` is initially 0, we need to adjust the initial state such that `i` can start from 200008 and decrement.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - `i` must be adjusted to start from 200008 instead of 0.
   - `rmn[i]` and `rmx[i]` are already defined appropriately for the entire range, so no change is needed for these variables.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`i` is 200008**
