Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `n` must be greater than 0
  - `i` is 1
  - `x` is the first element of `dat`
  - `y` is the second element of `dat`
  - `s[x + y & 1]` is a list containing a tuple `(-x + y, x + y)`

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for i in xrange(n):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

2. **Next Iteration Check:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Currently, `i` is 1, so for the next iteration, `i` should become 2.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to become 2.

3. **Condition on `n`:**
   - Since `n` must be greater than 0, it remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

4. **List `s`:**
   - The value of `s[x + y & 1]` is a list containing a tuple `(-x + y, x + y)`.
   - This part of the state does not change based on the loop itself but is determined by the values of `x` and `y`.

5. **Elements `x` and `y`:**
   - These remain the same as they are elements of the list `dat` and do not change within the loop.

### Updated State:
- `n` remains greater than 0 (no change).
- `i` becomes 2.
- `x` remains the first element of `dat`.
- `y` remains the second element of `dat`.
- `s[x + y & 1]` remains a list containing a tuple `(-x + y, x + y)`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x` is the first element of `dat`, `y` is the second element of `dat`, `s[x + y & 1]` is a list containing a tuple `(-x + y, x + y)`**
