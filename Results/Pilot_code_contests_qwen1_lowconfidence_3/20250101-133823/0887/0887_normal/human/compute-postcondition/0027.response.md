Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `i`. It iterates from `0` to `200008` (inclusive) because `xrange` in Python includes the start value but excludes the stop value.

2. **Determine Initial State**: We know the following initial states:
   - `a` is a list of tuples, and the x values in these tuples may or may not have been updated based on the condition `lmx[x] < y`.
   - `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx` are all in their previous states or are shallow copies of `lmn` and `lmx`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `[0, 200008]`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop will run for 200009 iterations, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to `0` before the loop starts.
   - The states of `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx` do not change within the loop, so they remain in their previous states.

### Final State Adjustment:

The state before the loop starts needs to include `i` being set to `0`, as this ensures the loop will execute.

### Final Answer:

State: **`a` is a list of tuples that may or may not have had their x values updated based on the condition `lmx[x] < y` for each tuple `(x, y)` in `a`, `lmn` is in its previous state, `lmx` is in its previous state, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, and `i` is 0**
