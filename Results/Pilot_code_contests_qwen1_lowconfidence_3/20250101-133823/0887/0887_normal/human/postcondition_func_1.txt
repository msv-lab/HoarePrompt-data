The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` and a flat sequence of 2*n integers representing the coordinates of black tokens from standard input. It processes these coordinates to group them into two lists based on whether the sum of the coordinates (x + y) is even or odd. Specifically, it creates a list `s` containing two sublists: the first sublist contains tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` for even sums, and the second sublist contains tuples for odd sums. Finally, it prints the sum of the outputs of `func_1` applied to these two sublists.
