`n` is an integer representing the number of black tokens, and `dat` is an iterable containing pairs of integers representing the x and y coordinates of each black token. The tokens' coordinates are read from standard input in a way that `dat` is a flat sequence of 2*n integers, with each pair of integers representing the coordinates of one black token.
