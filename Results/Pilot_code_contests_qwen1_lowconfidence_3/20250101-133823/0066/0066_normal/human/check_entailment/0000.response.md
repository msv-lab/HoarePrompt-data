Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the sequence of five platforms with equal jumps exists but is not checked properly. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if a slice of five consecutive platforms exists but does not ensure that these platforms are part of a valid sequence of jumps. This can lead to false negatives.

For example, consider the input:
```
16
.**.*..*.***.***
```
In this case, there is a valid sequence of five platforms: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14. However, the program might fail to detect this sequence correctly due to the current implementation of `func_1`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the sequence of jumps is validated properly by checking if the next platform after the initial jump sequence is also a platform. The current implementation only checks if a sequence of five platforms exists but does not validate the jump lengths consistently.
