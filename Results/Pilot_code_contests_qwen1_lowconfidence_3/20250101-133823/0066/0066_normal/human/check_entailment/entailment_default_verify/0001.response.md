Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program checks if there exists a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals between them, which aligns with the requirement of being able to perform a sequence of four jumps of the same length. The `func_1` function verifies potential sequences, and `func_2` iterates over the field to find such sequences. The output hints confirm this behavior and do not indicate any logical flaws or edge cases that the program cannot handle given the problem constraints. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
