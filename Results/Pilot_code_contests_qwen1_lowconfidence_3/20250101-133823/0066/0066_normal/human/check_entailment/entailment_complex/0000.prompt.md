You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In this problem you will meet the simplified model of game King of Thieves.

In a new ZeptoLab game called "King of Thieves" your aim is to reach a chest with gold by controlling your character, avoiding traps and obstacles on your way.

<image>

An interesting feature of the game is that you can design your own levels that will be available to other players. Let's consider the following simple design of a level.

A dungeon consists of n segments located at a same vertical level, each segment is either a platform that character can stand on, or a pit with a trap that makes player lose if he falls into it. All segments have the same length, platforms on the scheme of the level are represented as '*' and pits are represented as '.'. 

One of things that affects speedrun characteristics of the level is a possibility to perform a series of consecutive jumps of the same length. More formally, when the character is on the platform number i1, he can make a sequence of jumps through the platforms i1 < i2 < ... < ik, if i2 - i1 = i3 - i2 = ... = ik - ik - 1. Of course, all segments i1, i2, ... ik should be exactly the platforms, not pits. 

Let's call a level to be good if you can perform a sequence of four jumps of the same length or in the other words there must be a sequence i1, i2, ..., i5, consisting of five platforms so that the intervals between consecutive platforms are of the same length. Given the scheme of the level, check if it is good.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of segments on the level.

Next line contains the scheme of the level represented as a string of n characters '*' and '.'.

Output

If the level is good, print the word "yes" (without the quotes), otherwise print the word "no" (without the quotes).

Examples

Input

16
.**.*..*.***.**.


Output

yes

Input

11
.*.*...*.*.


Output

no

Note

In the first sample test you may perform a sequence of jumps through platforms 2, 5, 8, 11, 14.
Annotated Functions:
from __future__ import print_function

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: field is a string consisting of '*' and '.', and i is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(field).
def func_1(field, i):
    for slice_len in xrange(1, len(field) + 1):
        res = field[i::slice_len]
        
        if len(res) == 5 and set(res) == {'*'}:
            return slice_len
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `field` is a non-empty string, `res` is the final substring of `field` starting from index `i` and sliced with the last `slice_len` value. If the length of `res` is 5 and the set of characters in `res` is equal to {'*'}, the function returns the last `slice_len` value. Otherwise, the function returns None.
    return 0
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `field` consisting of '*' and '.' and an integer `i` such that \(0 \leq i < \text{len}(field)\). It iterates over possible slice lengths from 1 to the length of `field`. For each slice length, it creates a substring `res` starting from index `i` and slices `field` with the current slice length. If the length of `res` is exactly 5 and all characters in `res` are '*', the function returns the current slice length. If no such substring is found, the function returns 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and field is a string of length n consisting of characters '*' and '.', representing the segments of the level where '*' is a platform and '.' is a pit.
def func_2():
    n = int(raw_input())
    field = raw_input()
    win = False
    for i in xrange(n):
        if field[i] != '.':
            slice_len = func_1(field, i)
            if slice_len:
                j = i + 4 * slice_len
                if j + slice_len >= n or field[j + slice_len] == '*':
                    win = True
                    break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 100 (or the last index `n-1`), `n` is a positive integer, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, `win` is `True` if any `field[i]` is not `'.'` and satisfies the conditions within the loop, otherwise `win` remains `False`, `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len` where `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)` if `field[i] != '.'`. If `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'`, the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement is broken out of.
    if win :
        print('yes')
    else :
        print('no')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`i` is 100, `n` is a positive integer, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`. If `win` is `True` (at least one `field[i]` is not `'.'` and satisfies the conditions within the loop), then the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement is broken out of if either `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'`, the output is 'yes'. If `win` is `False`, `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len` where `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)` if `field[i] == '.'`, and if `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'`, the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement is broken out of; the console prints 'no'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` and a string `field` which is a sequence of `'*'` and `'.'`. It checks if there exists a segment in `field` that can be safely traversed without falling into a pit (`'.'`). Specifically, it looks for a segment starting at an index where the character is not a pit (`'.'`), and checks if a subsequent segment of length `4 * slice_len` is either outside the bounds of the string or is itself a platform (`'*'`). If such a segment is found, the function sets `win` to `True`. After checking all possible segments, the function prints `'yes'` if `win` is `True`, indicating that a safe path exists, and `'no'` otherwise. Potential edge cases include when `n` is less than 1 or when the entire `field` consists of pits only. The function also assumes that `func_1` returns the length of the segment to be checked, and this functionality is not explicitly defined in the provided code.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
