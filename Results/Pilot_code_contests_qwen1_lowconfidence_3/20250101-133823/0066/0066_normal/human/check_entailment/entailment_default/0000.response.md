Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the requirement to check if there exists a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals between them. The function `func_1` is designed to find a substring of length 5 starting from a given index `i` and consisting entirely of platforms (`'*'`). However, the main function `func_2` does not use `func_1` to directly check for a sequence of five platforms. Instead, it checks if a segment of length `4 * slice_len` starting from `i + slice_len` is either outside the bounds of the string or is itself a platform. This logic does not guarantee that there is a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals between them.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should use `func_1` to find a potential interval and then verify that there are indeed five platforms at that interval. The current implementation does not ensure this condition is met for every potential case. For example, consider the input:

```
16
.**.*..*.***.**
```

The code would incorrectly identify this as "no" because it does not correctly check for a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals.
