You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In this problem you will meet the simplified model of game King of Thieves.

In a new ZeptoLab game called "King of Thieves" your aim is to reach a chest with gold by controlling your character, avoiding traps and obstacles on your way.

<image>

An interesting feature of the game is that you can design your own levels that will be available to other players. Let's consider the following simple design of a level.

A dungeon consists of n segments located at a same vertical level, each segment is either a platform that character can stand on, or a pit with a trap that makes player lose if he falls into it. All segments have the same length, platforms on the scheme of the level are represented as '*' and pits are represented as '.'. 

One of things that affects speedrun characteristics of the level is a possibility to perform a series of consecutive jumps of the same length. More formally, when the character is on the platform number i1, he can make a sequence of jumps through the platforms i1 < i2 < ... < ik, if i2 - i1 = i3 - i2 = ... = ik - ik - 1. Of course, all segments i1, i2, ... ik should be exactly the platforms, not pits. 

Let's call a level to be good if you can perform a sequence of four jumps of the same length or in the other words there must be a sequence i1, i2, ..., i5, consisting of five platforms so that the intervals between consecutive platforms are of the same length. Given the scheme of the level, check if it is good.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of segments on the level.

Next line contains the scheme of the level represented as a string of n characters '*' and '.'.

Output

If the level is good, print the word "yes" (without the quotes), otherwise print the word "no" (without the quotes).

Examples

Input

16
.**.*..*.***.**.


Output

yes

Input

11
.*.*...*.*.


Output

no

Note

In the first sample test you may perform a sequence of jumps through platforms 2, 5, 8, 11, 14.
Program:
```
from __future__ import print_function
#Function 1:
def func_1(field, i):
    for slice_len in xrange(1, len(field) + 1):
        res = field[i::slice_len]
        if len(res) == 5 and set(res) == {'*'}:
            return slice_len
    return 0

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    n = int(raw_input())
    field = raw_input()
    win = False
    for i in xrange(n):
        if field[i] != '.':
            slice_len = func_1(field, i)
            if slice_len:
                j = i + 4 * slice_len
                if j + slice_len >= n or field[j + slice_len] == '*':
                    win = True
                    break
    if win:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the sequence of five platforms with equal jumps exists but is not checked properly. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if a slice of five consecutive platforms exists but does not ensure that these platforms are part of a valid sequence of jumps. This can lead to false negatives.

For example, consider the input:
```
16
.**.*..*.***.***
```
In this case, there is a valid sequence of five platforms: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14. However, the program might fail to detect this sequence correctly due to the current implementation of `func_1`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the sequence of jumps is validated properly by checking if the next platform after the initial jump sequence is also a platform. The current implementation only checks if a sequence of five platforms exists but does not validate the jump lengths consistently.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from __future__ import print_function

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: field is a string consisting of '*' and '.', and i is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(field).
def func_1(field, i):
    for slice_len in xrange(1, len(field) + 1):
        res = field[i::slice_len]
        
        if len(res) == 5 and set(res) == {'*'}:
            return slice_len
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `field` is a non-empty string, `res` is the final substring of `field` starting from index `i` and sliced with the last `slice_len` value. If the length of `res` is 5 and the set of characters in `res` is equal to {'*'}, the function returns the last `slice_len` value. Otherwise, the function returns None.
    return 0
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `field` consisting of '*' and '.' and an integer `i` such that \(0 \leq i < \text{len}(field)\). It iterates over possible slice lengths from 1 to the length of `field`. For each slice length, it creates a substring `res` starting from index `i` and slices `field` with the current slice length. If the length of `res` is exactly 5 and all characters in `res` are '*', the function returns the current slice length. If no such substring is found, the function returns 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and field is a string of length n consisting of characters '*' and '.', representing the segments of the level where '*' is a platform and '.' is a pit.
def func_2():
    n = int(raw_input())
    field = raw_input()
    win = False
    for i in xrange(n):
        if field[i] != '.':
            slice_len = func_1(field, i)
            if slice_len:
                j = i + 4 * slice_len
                if j + slice_len >= n or field[j + slice_len] == '*':
                    win = True
                    break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 100 (or the last index `n-1`), `n` is a positive integer, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, `win` is `True` if any `field[i]` is not `'.'` and satisfies the conditions within the loop, otherwise `win` remains `False`, `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len` where `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)` if `field[i] != '.'`. If `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'`, the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement is broken out of.
    if win :
        print('yes')
    else :
        print('no')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`i` is 100, `n` is a positive integer, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`. If `win` is `True` (at least one `field[i]` is not `'.'` and satisfies the conditions within the loop), then the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement is broken out of if either `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'`, the output is 'yes'. If `win` is `False`, `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len` where `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)` if `field[i] == '.'`, and if `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'`, the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement is broken out of; the console prints 'no'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` and a string `field` which is a sequence of `'*'` and `'.'`. It checks if there exists a segment in `field` that can be safely traversed without falling into a pit (`'.'`). Specifically, it looks for a segment starting at an index where the character is not a pit (`'.'`), and checks if a subsequent segment of length `4 * slice_len` is either outside the bounds of the string or is itself a platform (`'*'`). If such a segment is found, the function sets `win` to `True`. After checking all possible segments, the function prints `'yes'` if `win` is `True`, indicating that a safe path exists, and `'no'` otherwise. Potential edge cases include when `n` is less than 1 or when the entire `field` consists of pits only. The function also assumes that `func_1` returns the length of the segment to be checked, and this functionality is not explicitly defined in the provided code.
