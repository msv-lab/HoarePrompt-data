Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to find a substring of length 5 starting from index `i` that consists entirely of platforms ('*'). However, the main function `func_2` uses the result of `func_1` to check for a sequence of four jumps of the same length, which is not aligned with the problem description.

The problem description requires checking if there exists a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals, not just finding a substring of length 5. The provided code only checks if a segment of length 4 * `slice_len` is a platform or within bounds, which does not guarantee that the sequence of five platforms exists.

For example, consider the input:

```
16
.**.*..*.***.*
```

The correct output should be "yes" because there is a sequence of five platforms: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14. However, the provided code would not correctly identify this sequence because it does not check for a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
