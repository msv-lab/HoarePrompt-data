Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to determine if a level is "good" according to the problem description. Here’s why:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks for sequences of four equal-length jumps in the level.
   - It iterates over possible jump lengths (`slice_len`) from 1 to the length of the level.
   - For each `slice_len`, it creates a substring starting from the current index `i` and slices the rest of the string with the same `slice_len`.
   - If the substring of length 5 consists entirely of `'*'`, it returns the `slice_len`. Otherwise, it returns 0.
   - The function ensures that we can find a sequence of five platforms with equal spacing if it exists.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input values for `n` (the number of segments) and `field` (the level scheme).
   - It initializes a boolean variable `win` to track whether a valid sequence of jumps has been found.
   - It iterates over each index `i` of the level.
   - If the segment at index `i` is not a pit (`'.'`), it calls `func_1` to check for valid jumps starting from that position.
   - If `func_1` returns a non-zero value (`slice_len`), it calculates the index `j` for the fifth platform.
   - If `j + slice_len` is within bounds and the segment at `j + slice_len` is also a platform (`'*'`), it sets `win` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Finally, it prints "yes" if `win` is `True`, indicating that a sequence of four equal-length jumps was found. Otherwise, it prints "no".

### Why the Program Follows the Problem Description:

- **Input Validation**: The program correctly handles the input constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and input format (a string of `'.'` and `'*'`).
- **Correct Logic**: The program uses the function `func_1` to verify the existence of a sequence of four equal-length jumps and then checks for a sequence of five platforms using `func_2`.
- **Output**: The program prints "yes" if a valid sequence of four equal-length jumps exists and "no" otherwise, which aligns perfectly with the problem description.

Given that the program accurately implements the specified logic and adheres to the problem description, the correctness of the program is **True**.
