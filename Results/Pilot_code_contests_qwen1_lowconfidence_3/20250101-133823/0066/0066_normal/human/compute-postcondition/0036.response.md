The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `field`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.', where '*' represents a platform and '.' represents a pit.

The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given constraints and relationships. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `field` as described above.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `field`.**
