Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` and a string `field` which is a sequence of `'*'` and `'.'`. It checks if there exists a segment in `field` that can be safely traversed without falling into a pit (`'.'`). Specifically, it looks for a segment starting at an index where the character is not a pit (`'.'`), and checks if a subsequent segment of length `4 * slice_len` is either outside the bounds of the string or is itself a platform (`'*'`). If such a segment is found, the function sets `win` to `True`. After checking all possible segments, the function prints `'yes'` if `win` is `True`, indicating that a safe path exists, and `'no'` otherwise. Potential edge cases include when `n` is less than 1 or when the entire `field` consists of pits only. The function also assumes that `func_1` returns the length of the segment to be checked, and this functionality is not explicitly defined in the provided code.**
