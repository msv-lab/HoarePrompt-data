Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, `win` is `True` if `field[1]` is not `'.'`, `j` is `2 + 4 * k`, `slice_len` is `k`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'`.***
