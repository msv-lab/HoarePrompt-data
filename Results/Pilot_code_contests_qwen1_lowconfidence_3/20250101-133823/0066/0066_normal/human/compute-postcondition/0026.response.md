The `break` statement does not change any variable values; it only exits the loop or the most nested block it is in. Since there is no loop or nested block provided in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, `win` is `True`, `j` is `2 + 4 * k`, `slice_len` is `k` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
