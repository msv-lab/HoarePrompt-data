The code `break` does not affect any variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code snippet, it implies that the break statement might be part of an implied loop or conditional structure that is not shown. However, since the break statement itself does not modify any variables, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, `win` is `True`, `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len` and we break out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement.**
