`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`. This means `n` now holds an integer input from the user, where the integer is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The `field` variable remains unchanged as the input does not affect its value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `field` is a string of length n consisting of characters '*' and '.'**
