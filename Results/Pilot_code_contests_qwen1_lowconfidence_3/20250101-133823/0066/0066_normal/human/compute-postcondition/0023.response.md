The code assigns the value returned by `func_1(field, i)` to `slice_len`. Since `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `slice_len`. However, we know that `i` is 2 and `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`. Also, `win` is `True` if `field[1]` is not `'.'`, and `j` is `2 + 4 * slice_len`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, `win` is `True` if `field[1]` is not `'.'`, `j` is `2 + 4 * slice_len`, `slice_len` is the value returned by `func_1(field, i)`**
