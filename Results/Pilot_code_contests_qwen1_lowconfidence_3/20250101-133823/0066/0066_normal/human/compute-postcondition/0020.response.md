Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, `win` is `True` if `field[1]` is not `'.'`, `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len` where `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)`. If `j + slice_len` is greater than or equal to `n` or `field[j + slice_len]` is `'*'`, the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement is broken out of. If the condition `slice_len` is false, the program continues executing outside the if-else block with the same preconditions as before the if statement.***
