`j` is assigned the value `i + 4 * slice_len`. Given that `i` is 0 and `slice_len` is not 0, the value of `j` is `4 * slice_len`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, `win` is `False`, `j` is `4 * slice_len`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, `win` is `False`, `j` is `4 * slice_len`**
