The code `break` is used to exit the loop or the most internal if statement. Since no loop or conditional block is specified in the given code snippet, the values of the variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, `win` is `True`, `j` is `4 * slice_len`, and either `j + slice_len` is greater than or equal to `n` or the character at index `j + slice_len` in `field` is `'*'`**
