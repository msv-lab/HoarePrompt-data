According to the given for loop, the loop can execute if the variable `i` is within the range specified by `n`. Before the loop starts, we know that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), and `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, while `win` is `False`.

To ensure the loop can execute, the initial value of `i` must be within the range of valid values for the loop, which means `i` should be 0 (the starting point of `xrange`) and less than `n`. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 0
- `n` should be greater than 0 (since `xrange(n)` generates numbers from 0 to \(n-1\))

So, the adjusted states are:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, `win` is `False`**
