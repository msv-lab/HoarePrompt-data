The code assigns the value of `i + 4 * slice_len` to `j`. We know from the initial state that `i` is 2 and `j` is `2 + 4 * slice_len`. Since `slice_len` is the value returned by `func_1(field, i)`, we need to determine its value first.

Let's assume `func_1(field, i)` returns the value of `slice_len`. After this function call, `slice_len` will hold the value returned by `func_1`.

Since the exact value of `slice_len` is not given, let's denote it as `k`. So, `slice_len` is equal to `k`.

Therefore, the new value of `j` will be:
\[ j = i + 4 * k \]
Given that `i` is 2, we can write:
\[ j = 2 + 4 * k \]

The other variables remain unchanged in value according to their initial conditions. So, the final output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, `win` is `True` if `field[1]` is not `'.'`, `j` is `2 + 4 * k`, `slice_len` is `k`**
