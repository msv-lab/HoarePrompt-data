Postcondition: **`i` is 100 (or the last index `n-1`), `n` is a positive integer, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, `win` is `False` (since any `field[i]` is `'.'` or no conditions within the loop are satisfied), `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len` where `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)` if `field[i] == '.'`, and if `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'`, the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement is broken out of.**
