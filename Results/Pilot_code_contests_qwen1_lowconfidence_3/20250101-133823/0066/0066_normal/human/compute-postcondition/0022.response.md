Let's break down the given information and adjust the states step by step for the next iteration of the loop.

### Given Information at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`
- `win` is `True` if `field[1]` is not `'.'`
- `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len` where `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)`
- If `j + slice_len` is greater than or equal to `n` or `field[j + slice_len]` is `'*'`, the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement is broken out of.
- If the condition `slice_len` is false, the program continues executing outside the if-else block with the same preconditions as before the if statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the value of `slice_len`:**
   - The value of `slice_len` is determined by the function `func_1(field, i)`.
   - Since we don't know the exact implementation of `func_1`, we will assume it returns some integer value.

2. **Calculate `j`:**
   - `j = i + 4 * slice_len`
   - Given `i = 1`, `j = 1 + 4 * slice_len`.

3. **Check the condition for breaking the loop:**
   - The loop breaks if `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'`.

4. **Assume the loop does not break:**
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `j + slice_len < n` and `field[j + slice_len] != '*'` must hold true.

5. **Update the states for the next iteration:**
   - `i` increases by 1, so `i` becomes `2`.
   - `j` updates to `2 + 4 * slice_len`.

### Final States at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 0 (no change)
- `field` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'` (no change)
- `win` is `True` if `field[1]` is not `'.'` (no change)
- `j` is `2 + 4 * slice_len`

### Adjusted State:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, `win` is `True` if `field[1]` is not `'.'`, `j` is `2 + 4 * slice_len`**
