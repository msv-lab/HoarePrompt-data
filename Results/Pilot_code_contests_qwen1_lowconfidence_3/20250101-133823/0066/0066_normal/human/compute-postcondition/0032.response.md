The print statement 'yes' does not affect any variables but simply outputs the string 'yes'. Therefore, the only change is in the output, and the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 100, `n` is a positive integer, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, `win` is `True` because at least one `field[i]` is not `'.'` and satisfies the conditions within the loop, `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len` where `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)` if `field[i] != '.'`, the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement is broken out of if either `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'`, the output is 'yes'.**
