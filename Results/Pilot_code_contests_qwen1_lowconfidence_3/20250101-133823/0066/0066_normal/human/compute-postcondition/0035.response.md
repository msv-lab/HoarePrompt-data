Postcondition: ***`i` is 100, `n` is a positive integer, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`. If `win` is `True` (at least one `field[i]` is not `'.'` and satisfies the conditions within the loop), then the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement is broken out of if either `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'`, the output is 'yes'. If `win` is `False`, `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len` where `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)` if `field[i] == '.'`, and if `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'`, the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement is broken out of; the console prints 'no'.***
