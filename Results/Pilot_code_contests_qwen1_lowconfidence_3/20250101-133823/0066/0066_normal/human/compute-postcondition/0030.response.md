Output State: **`i` is 100 (or the last index `n-1`), `n` is a positive integer, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, `win` is `True` if any `field[i]` is not `'.'` and satisfies the conditions within the loop, otherwise `win` remains `False`, `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len` where `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)` if `field[i] != '.'`. If `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'`, the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement is broken out of.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
2. **Variable `i`**: The loop increments `i` by 1 each time until it reaches `n-1`.
3. **Condition Check**: For each `i`, the loop checks if `field[i]` is not `'.'`. If `field[i]` is `'.'`, the loop simply continues without changing any state.
4. **Win Condition**: If `field[i]` is not `'.'`, the loop calculates `slice_len` using `func_1(field, i)`. It then sets `j = i + 4 * slice_len` and checks if `j + slice_len` is greater than or equal to `n` or if `field[j + slice_len]` is `'*'`. If either condition is met, the loop sets `win` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
5. **Final State**:
   - `i` will be `n-1` (the last index checked).
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `field` remains unchanged.
   - `win` will be `True` if any `field[i]` is not `'.'` and satisfies the conditions within the loop, otherwise it remains `False`.
   - `j` will be `i + 4 * slice_len` only if `field[i] != '.'` and the conditions within the loop are satisfied.

If the loop does not execute at all (which means `n` is 0 or all elements in `field` are `'.'`), the final state will be:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is 0.
- `field` is a string of length 0.
- `win` remains `False`.
- `j` is not defined or irrelevant since the loop does not execute.
