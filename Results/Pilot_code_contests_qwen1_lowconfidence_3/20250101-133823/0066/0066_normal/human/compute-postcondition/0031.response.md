Postcondition: **`i` is 100 (or the last index `n-1`), `n` is a positive integer, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, `win` is `True` because at least one `field[i]` is not `'.'` and satisfies the conditions within the loop, `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len` where `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)` if `field[i] != '.'`, the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement is broken out of if either `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'`.**
