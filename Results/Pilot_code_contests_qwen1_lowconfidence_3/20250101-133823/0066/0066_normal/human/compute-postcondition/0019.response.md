Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, `win` is `True` (if `field[1]` is not `'.'`), `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len`. If `j + slice_len` is greater than or equal to `n` or `field[j + slice_len]` is `'*'`, we break out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement.***
