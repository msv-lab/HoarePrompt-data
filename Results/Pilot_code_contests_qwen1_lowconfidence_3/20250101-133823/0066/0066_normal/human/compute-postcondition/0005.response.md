The code `slice_len = func_1(field, i)` calls a function `func_1` with arguments `field` and `i`. The function `func_1` returns a value which is assigned to `slice_len`. However, the specific value of `func_1(field, i)` is not provided, and the function itself is not defined. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `slice_len` without knowing what `func_1` does. The variables `i`, `n`, `field`, and `win` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, `win` is `False`, `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)`**
