Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, `win` is `True` if either `j + slice_len` is greater than or equal to `n` or the character at index `j + slice_len` in `field` is `'*'`. Otherwise, `win` remains `False`, `j` is `4 * slice_len`, and `i`, `n`, `field`, and `win` retain their initial values.***
