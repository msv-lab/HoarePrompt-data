The line `win = True` does not affect the values of the other variables. It only changes the value of `win` to `True`. All other variables remain in their original states.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, `win` is `True`, `j` is `2 + 4 * k`, `slice_len` is `k`**
