The code `slice_len = func_1(field, i)` calls a function `func_1` with arguments `field` and `i`. The function `func_1` returns a value which is assigned to `slice_len`. However, the specific behavior of `func_1` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `slice_len`. We know that `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, and `win` is `True` if `field[i]` is not `'.'`. Otherwise, `win` remains `False`.

Since the value of `slice_len` is not specified, we can only state that it is the return value of `func_1`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, `win` is `True` if `field[1]` is not `'.'` otherwise `win` is `False`, `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)`**
