The function `func_1` accepts a string `field` consisting of '*' and '.' and an integer `i` such that \(0 \leq i < \text{len}(field)\). It iterates over possible slice lengths from 1 to the length of `field`. For each slice length, it creates a substring `res` starting from index `i` and slices `field` with the current slice length. If the length of `res` is exactly 5 and all characters in `res` are '*', the function returns the current slice length. If no such substring is found, the function returns 0.
