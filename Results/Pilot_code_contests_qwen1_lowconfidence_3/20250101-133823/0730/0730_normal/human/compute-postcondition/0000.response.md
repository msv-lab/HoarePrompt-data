The code calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The length of the string `s` is stored in `n`, while the string `s` itself remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` and retains the original state of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R', `n` is the length of `s`**
