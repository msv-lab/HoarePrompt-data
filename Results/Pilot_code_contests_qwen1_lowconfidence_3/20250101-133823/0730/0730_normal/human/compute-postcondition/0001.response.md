The code initializes `ans` to 0. The value of `s` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `ans` and retains the initial values of `s` and `n`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R', `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is 0**
