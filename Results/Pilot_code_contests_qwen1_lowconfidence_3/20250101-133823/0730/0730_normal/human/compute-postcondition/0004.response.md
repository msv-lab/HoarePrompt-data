`ans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ans` is 0, so after executing `ans += 1`, the value of `ans` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R', `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 1, the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the character at index `i-1` in `s` is 'L', and the character at index `i` in `s` is 'L'**
