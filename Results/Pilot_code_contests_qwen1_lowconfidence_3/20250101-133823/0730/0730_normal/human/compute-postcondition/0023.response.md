Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of 'L' and 'R', and returns the count of consecutive pairs of 'LL' and 'RR' in the string `s`. After executing the function, the program state will have the variable `ans` containing the total count of such consecutive pairs. The function iterates through the string `s` and increments `ans` whenever it finds two consecutive 'L' characters ('LL') or two consecutive 'R' characters ('RR'). The function handles all edge cases, including when the string `s` is very short (length 1 or 2), ensuring no out-of-bounds errors occur during the iteration.**
