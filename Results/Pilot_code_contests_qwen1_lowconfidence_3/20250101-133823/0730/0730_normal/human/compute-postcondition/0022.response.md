The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R', and its length is `N` where `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`. The function also accepts an integer `K` where `1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5`, although `K` is not used in the description of the output.

The function returns `ans`, which is the count of consecutive pairs of 'LL' and 'RR' in the string `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` consisting of 'L' and 'R', and return the count of consecutive pairs of 'LL' and 'RR' in the string `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting of 'L' and 'R', and returns the count of consecutive pairs of 'LL' and 'RR' in the string `s`.**
