Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R', `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is 1 if the following conditions are met for `i = n-1`: the character at index `n-1` in `s` is 'R' and `n-1` is less than or equal to `n-2` and the character at index `n-2` in `s` is 'R'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If the if condition is not met, `ans` remains unchanged.***
