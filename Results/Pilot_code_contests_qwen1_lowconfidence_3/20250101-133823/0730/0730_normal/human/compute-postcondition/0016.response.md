`ans` is incremented by 1 based on its previous value. From the initial state, if the character at index `n-1` in `s` is 'L' and `n-1` is greater than or equal to 1, and the character at index `n-2` in `s` is 'L', then `ans` was 2. If the character at index `n-1` in `s` is 'R' and `n-1` is less than or equal to `n-2` and the character at index `n-2` in `s` is 'R', then `ans` was 1. In any other case, `ans` was 0.

- If `ans` was initially 2, then after `ans += 1`, `ans` becomes 3.
- If `ans` was initially 1, then after `ans += 1`, `ans` becomes 2.
- If `ans` was initially 0, then after `ans += 1`, `ans` becomes 1.

The values of the other variables (`s`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R', `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is 3 if it was 2, 2 if it was 1, and 1 if it was 0, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
