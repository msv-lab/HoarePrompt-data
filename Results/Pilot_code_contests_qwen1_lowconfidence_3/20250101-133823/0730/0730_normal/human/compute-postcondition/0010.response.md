Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `s` is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R'.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `ans` is 1 if certain conditions are met, otherwise it is 0.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Conditions for `ans`**:
   - If `s[i]` is 'L' and `i >= 1` and `s[i-1]` is 'L', then `ans` becomes 1.
   - If `s[i]` is 'R' and `i <= n-2` and `s[i+1]` is 'R', then `ans` becomes 1.
   - Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

4. **Current Iteration**:
   - We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Analysis**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been one less than `n` (i.e., `i = n-1`).
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i = n`.

6. **Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n`, the loop will continue if `i` is less than `n` after incrementing.
   - Therefore, we need to check the conditions for `i = n` to determine if `ans` will change.

7. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The value of `s` and `n` remain unchanged.
   - `ans` will be 1 if any of the conditions are met for `i = n-1` in the previous iteration.
   - Since `i` will now be `n`, we need to check the conditions for `i = n` to see if they are met.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - The conditions for `i = n-1` will determine the value of `ans`.
   - If the conditions are met, `ans` will be 1; otherwise, it will remain 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R', `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is 1 if either of the following conditions is met for `i = n-1`:
1. The character at index `n-1` in `s` is 'L' and `n-1` is greater than or equal to 1, and the character at index `n-2` in `s` is 'L'.
2. The character at index `n-1` in `s` is 'R' and `n-1` is less than or equal to `n-2`, and the character at index `n-2` in `s` is 'R'.
Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
