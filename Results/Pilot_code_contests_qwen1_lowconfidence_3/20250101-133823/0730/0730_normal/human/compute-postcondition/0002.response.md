According to the code, the loop will execute if the variable `n` is at least 1. The initial value of `s` being a string consisting of 'L' and 'R' and `ans` being 0 does not affect the ability of the loop to start executing, as long as `n` is greater than 0.

So, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R', `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 0**
