You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N people standing in a queue from west to east.

Given is a string S of length N representing the directions of the people. The i-th person from the west is facing west if the i-th character of S is `L`, and east if that character of S is `R`.

A person is happy if the person in front of him/her is facing the same direction. If no person is standing in front of a person, however, he/she is not happy.

You can perform the following operation any number of times between 0 and K (inclusive):

Operation: Choose integers l and r such that 1 \leq l \leq r \leq N, and rotate by 180 degrees the part of the queue: the l-th, (l+1)-th, ..., r-th persons. That is, for each i = 0, 1, ..., r-l, the (l + i)-th person from the west will stand the (r - i)-th from the west after the operation, facing east if he/she is facing west now, and vice versa.

What is the maximum possible number of happy people you can have?

Constraints

* N is an integer satisfying 1 \leq N \leq 10^5.
* K is an integer satisfying 1 \leq K \leq 10^5.
* |S| = N
* Each character of S is `L` or `R`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Output

Print the maximum possible number of happy people after at most K operations.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains several issues that prevent it from handling all potential cases correctly:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Initial Conditions**: The program checks if `S` is `'RL'` or `'LR'` and prints `0` without considering other possible initial conditions. This is incomplete because it does not handle other initial sequences like `'RLR'`, `'LRL'`, etc., properly.

2. **Incomplete Logic for `func_1` Function**: The function `func_1` is called but its implementation seems to only count adjacent pairs without considering the full context of the problem. It should be more comprehensive to handle all possible transitions and rotations.

3. **Inconsistent Variable Usage**: Variables like `lr`, `rl`, `lrl`, `rlr` are used without clear initialization or proper counting logic. For example, `lr` and `rl` should count the number of transitions from `L` to `R` and `R` to `L`, respectively, but their usage in the final calculation is unclear.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases effectively. For instance, if the queue starts with a single person or ends with a single person, the logic to handle such cases is missing.

5. **Rotation Operation Implementation**: The program attempts to implement the rotation operation but does not actually perform the 180-degree rotation within the constraints. Instead, it relies on the variable `K` to decide the number of happy people, which is an oversimplification of the problem.

Given these issues, the program cannot be guaranteed to work correctly for all potential inputs and cases. Specifically, it fails to account for various initial conditions and does not fully implement the logic required to maximize the number of happy people through rotations. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of 'L' and 'R', and returns the count of consecutive pairs of 'LL' and 'RR' in the string `s`. After executing the function, the program state will have the variable `ans` containing the total count of such consecutive pairs. The function iterates through the string `s` and increments `ans` whenever it finds two consecutive 'L' characters ('LL') or two consecutive 'R' characters ('RR'). The function handles all edge cases, including when the string `s` is very short (length 1 or 2), ensuring no out-of-bounds errors occur during the iteration.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
