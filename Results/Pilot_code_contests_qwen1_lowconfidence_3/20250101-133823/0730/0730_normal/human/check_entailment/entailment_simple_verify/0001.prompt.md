You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N people standing in a queue from west to east.

Given is a string S of length N representing the directions of the people. The i-th person from the west is facing west if the i-th character of S is `L`, and east if that character of S is `R`.

A person is happy if the person in front of him/her is facing the same direction. If no person is standing in front of a person, however, he/she is not happy.

You can perform the following operation any number of times between 0 and K (inclusive):

Operation: Choose integers l and r such that 1 \leq l \leq r \leq N, and rotate by 180 degrees the part of the queue: the l-th, (l+1)-th, ..., r-th persons. That is, for each i = 0, 1, ..., r-l, the (l + i)-th person from the west will stand the (r - i)-th from the west after the operation, facing east if he/she is facing west now, and vice versa.

What is the maximum possible number of happy people you can have?

Constraints

* N is an integer satisfying 1 \leq N \leq 10^5.
* K is an integer satisfying 1 \leq K \leq 10^5.
* |S| = N
* Each character of S is `L` or `R`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains several issues that prevent it from handling all potential cases correctly:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Initial Conditions**: The program checks if `S` is `'RL'` or `'LR'` and prints `0` without considering other possible initial conditions. This is incomplete because it does not handle other initial sequences like `'RLR'`, `'LRL'`, etc., properly.

2. **Incomplete Logic for `func_1` Function**: The function `func_1` is called but its implementation seems to only count adjacent pairs without considering the full context of the problem. It should be more comprehensive to handle all possible transitions and rotations.

3. **Inconsistent Variable Usage**: Variables like `lr`, `rl`, `lrl`, `rlr` are used without clear initialization or proper counting logic. For example, `lr` and `rl` should count the number of transitions from `L` to `R` and `R` to `L`, respectively, but their usage in the final calculation is unclear.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases effectively. For instance, if the queue starts with a single person or ends with a single person, the logic to handle such cases is missing.

5. **Rotation Operation Implementation**: The program attempts to implement the rotation operation but does not actually perform the 180-degree rotation within the constraints. Instead, it relies on the variable `K` to decide the number of happy people, which is an oversimplification of the problem.

Given these issues, the program cannot be guaranteed to work correctly for all potential inputs and cases. Specifically, it fails to account for various initial conditions and does not fully implement the logic required to maximize the number of happy people through rotations. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
