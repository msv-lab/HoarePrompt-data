Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum and maximum number of stolen hay blocks for every potential case. Specifically:

1. The program does not properly handle the calculation of the minimum number of stolen hay blocks. The formula used in `func_1` does not accurately represent the number of hay blocks that could have been stolen. For instance, if `A = 2`, `B = 4`, and `C = 4`, the number of remaining hay blocks is `(2-1) * (4-2) * (4-2) = 4`, and the number of stolen blocks should be `2 * (2+1) * (4+4+2) + 4 - 4 = 40`. However, the program incorrectly calculates this as `2 * (2+1) * (4+2+2) + 4 - 4 = 28`.

2. The program does not handle the case where the dimensions `A`, `B`, and `C` might not be integers. While the input `n` is an integer, the program assumes that the factors found will always form integer dimensions, which is not necessarily true.

3. The program's approach to finding the minimum number of stolen blocks is flawed. It iterates over possible values of `A` and `B` but does not ensure that the calculated dimensions `A`, `B`, and `C` are valid (i.e., they must be integers and satisfy the conditions of the problem).

4. The program's maximum number of stolen blocks calculation (`8 * n + 9`) is not derived from the problem's constraints and is likely incorrect. The correct maximum would depend on the dimensions of the original parallelepiped.

These issues indicate that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for every potential case.
