Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the input `n` from standard input, which is the number of remaining hay blocks after the theft. The input is expected to be an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). The code uses `eval` and `sys.stdin.readline()` to read the input, which is appropriate for this context.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly outputs `17 17`. This is a valid edge case because if there is only 1 block left, the initial configuration could have been \(2 \times 3 \times 3\) (since \(1 = (2-1) \times (3-2) \times (3-2)\)), leading to a total of 17 blocks being stolen.

3. **Initial Setup**:
   - The variable `r` is set to \(\sqrt{n} + 1\), and `r3` is set to \(10^{\frac{\log_{10}(n)}{3}} - 1\). These values are used to initialize the search for possible dimensions of the original parallelepiped.

4. **Finding Minimum and Maximum Stolen Blocks**:
   - The program iterates over possible values of `r` and checks if `n` is divisible by `r`. If it is, it calculates the possible dimensions \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) using \(m = \frac{n}{r}\).
   - For each valid set of dimensions, it calculates the number of stolen blocks using the function `func_1(A, B, C)`.
   - The function `func_1` computes the number of stolen blocks as \(2 \times (A + 1) \times (B + C + 2) + B \times C\).
   - The minimum number of stolen blocks (`mn`) is updated accordingly.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum and maximum number of stolen blocks. The maximum number of stolen blocks is derived as \(8 \times n + 9\), which is a valid upper bound based on the problem constraints.

### Why it is Correct:

- **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input within the specified range.
- **Edge Case**: It appropriately handles the edge case where `n` is 1.
- **Logic for Finding Dimensions**: The program correctly iterates through possible dimensions to find the minimum and maximum number of stolen blocks.
- **Function Calculation**: The function `func_1` accurately calculates the number of stolen blocks based on the given formula.

Thus, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description and works correctly for all valid inputs within the specified range.
