Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is a prime number. When `n` is a prime number, the program incorrectly calculates both the minimum and maximum number of stolen hay blocks.

Consider the input `n = 7`. In this case, the only possible dimensions for the initial parallelepiped are `1 × 1 × 7`, `1 × 7 × 1`, or `7 × 1 × 1`. After the theft, the barn will have `1 × (-1) × (-1)` hay blocks, which is not valid since dimensions cannot be negative. However, the program does not account for this scenario and still tries to calculate the minimum and maximum values using the formula `2 * (A + 1) * (B + C + 2) + B * C`.

The correct approach should handle the case where `n` is a prime number separately. For a prime number `p`, the only valid dimensions for the initial parallelepiped are `1 × 1 × p`, `1 × p × 1`, or `p × 1 × 1`. In such cases, the minimum number of stolen hay blocks would be `p - 1` and the maximum would be `3 * p - 3`.

Here’s a corrected version of the program that handles this edge case:

```python
import sys
import math

n = eval(sys.stdin.readline().strip('\n\r ').split()[0])

def func_1(A, B, C):
    return 2 * (A + 1) * (B + C + 2) + B * C

if n == 1:
    print('17 17')
    exit(0)

r = int(math.sqrt(float(n))) + 1
r3 = int(10 ** (math.log10(float(n)) / 3)) - 1
mx = 8 * n + 9
mn = mx

is_prime = True
for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
    if n % i == 0:
        is_prime = False
        break

if is_prime:
    mn = n - 1
    mx = 3 * n - 3
else:
    while r > 0:
        if n % r == 0:
            A = r
            m = n // r
            B = int(math.sqrt(float(m))) + 1
            while B > 0:
                if m % B == 0:
                    C = m // B
                    mn = min([mn, func_1(A, B, C), func_1(B, A, C), func_1(C, B, A)])
                B -= 1
        r -= 1

print('%d %d' % (mn, mx))
```

This corrected version explicitly checks if `n` is a prime number and handles it appropriately.
