Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimally and maximally possible number of stolen hay blocks. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Stolen Blocks**: The program attempts to find the minimum number of stolen blocks by considering different permutations of the dimensions \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) of the original parallelepiped. However, the function `func_1` used for calculating the minimum number of stolen blocks is incorrect. According to the problem, the number of remaining hay blocks is given by \((A - 1) \times (B - 2) \times (C - 2)\), and the total number of blocks originally is \(A \times B \times C\). Therefore, the number of stolen blocks should be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Stolen Blocks} = A \times B \times C - (A - 1) \times (B - 2) \times (C - 2)
   \]
   The current implementation of `func_1` does not reflect this calculation.

2. **Maximally Possible Stolen Blocks**: The program sets the maximum number of stolen blocks to \(8 \times n + 9\), which is an incorrect heuristic and does not necessarily represent the maximum possible stolen blocks. The actual maximum number of stolen blocks can be derived from the constraints and the relationship between the dimensions of the original and remaining parallelepipeds.

To fix the program, you need to implement the correct logic for both the minimum and maximum number of stolen blocks. Specifically:

- For the minimum number of stolen blocks, you should calculate:
  \[
  \text{Min Stolen} = A \times B \times C - (A - 1) \times (B - 2) \times (C - 2)
  \]
  where \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are the dimensions of the original parallelepiped.

- For the maximum number of stolen blocks, you need to consider the largest possible original parallelepiped that could reduce to the given \(n\) after the theft. This can be derived by finding the closest factorization of \(n\) and then calculating the maximum possible stolen blocks using the formula above.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

n = eval(sys.stdin.readline().strip('\n\r '))
if n == 1:
    print('17 17')
    exit(0)

max_stolen = 8 * n + 9
min_stolen = max_stolen

for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 2):
    if n % i == 0:
        j = n // i
        for k in range(1, int(j**0.5) + 2):
            if j % k == 0:
                l = j // k
                original_blocks = i * j * k
                remaining_blocks = (i - 1) * (j - 2) * (k - 2)
                stolen_blocks = original_blocks - remaining_blocks
                min_stolen = min(min_stolen, stolen_blocks)
                max_stolen = max(max_stolen, stolen_blocks)

print(f'{min_stolen} {max_stolen}')
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the minimally and maximally possible number of stolen hay blocks based on the problem description.
