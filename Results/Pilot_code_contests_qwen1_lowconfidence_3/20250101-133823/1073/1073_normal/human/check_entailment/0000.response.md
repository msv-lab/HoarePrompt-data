Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum and maximum number of stolen hay blocks for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function and the way the dimensions \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are determined do not align with the problem description.

For example, consider the input \(n = 12\). According to the problem, the original parallelepiped could have dimensions such as \(5 \times 3 \times 2\) (since \(5 \times 3 \times 2 = 30\) and \((5-1) \times (3-2) \times (2-2) = 4\), so \(30 - 4 = 26\)). However, the program calculates the maximum number of stolen blocks as \(8 \times 12 + 9 = 105\), which is incorrect because the maximum number of stolen blocks should be calculated based on valid dimensions.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the input \(n\) cannot be expressed as \((A-1) \times (B-2) \times (C-2)\) for any positive integers \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). For instance, if \(n = 1\), the program incorrectly outputs \(17 17\) instead of the correct values based on the valid dimensions.

These issues indicate that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases.
