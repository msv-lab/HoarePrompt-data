Final: **False**

Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code and the original assessment, the program still does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum and Maximum Stolen Blocks:**
   - The `func_1` function does not correctly represent the formula for the number of stolen blocks. The formula used in `func_1` is \(2 \cdot (A + 1) \cdot (B + C + 2) + B \cdot C\), which does not match the problem's requirement of calculating \((A - 1) \cdot (B - 2) \cdot (C - 2)\).
   - The logic in the main loop to find the minimum and maximum number of stolen blocks is flawed. The current approach does not ensure that the dimensions \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are correctly derived from \(n\).

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case \(n = 1\) incorrectly by outputting \(17 17\) instead of the correct values based on valid dimensions.
   - The program does not properly handle cases where the input \(n\) cannot be expressed as \((A-1) \times (B-2) \times (C-2)\) for any positive integers \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).

3. **Invalid Dimensions:**
   - The dimensions \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are not derived in a manner that ensures they satisfy the condition \((A - 1) \times (B - 2) \times (C - 2) = n\). This leads to incorrect calculations of both the minimum and maximum number of stolen blocks.

Given these issues, the annotated version confirms that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases, hence maintaining the original assessment.
