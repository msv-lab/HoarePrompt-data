#State of the program right berfore the function call: A, B, and C are positive integers. The number of remaining hay blocks after the theft is given by n = (A - 1) × (B - 2) × (C - 2), where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 109.
def func_1(A, B, C):
    return 2 * (A + 1) * (B + C + 2) + B * C
    #The program returns the value 2 * (A + 1) * (B + C + 2) + B * C, where A, B, and C are positive integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three positive integer parameters A, B, and C. It calculates and returns the value \(2 \times (A + 1) \times (B + C + 2) + B \times C\). This expression involves simple arithmetic operations and does not include any conditional statements or checks for the range of the inputs beyond ensuring they are positive integers. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code, but it is implied that A, B, and C must be positive integers. The function does not perform any validation on these conditions; thus, if non-positive integers are passed, the behavior is undefined.
