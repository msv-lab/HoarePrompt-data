Precondition: **n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The second line is a string of length n containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where '.' represents an empty cell, '#' represents a cell with an obstacle, 'G' represents the grasshopper's starting position, and 'T' represents the insect's position. It is guaranteed that both 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string.**
