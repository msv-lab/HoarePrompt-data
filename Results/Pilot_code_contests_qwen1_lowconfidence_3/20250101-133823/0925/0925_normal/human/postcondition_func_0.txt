The function takes three inputs: two integers `n` and `k`, and a string representing a sequence of cells where each cell can be one of four types: empty (`.`), obstacle (`#`), grasshopper (`G`), or insect (`T`). The function checks if the grasshopper can jump to the insect following the specified rules. Specifically, it checks if the distance between the grasshopper and the insect, measured in steps of `k`, is a multiple of `k` and if there are no obstacles along the path. If these conditions are met, the function prints `'YES'`, indicating that the grasshopper can reach the insect. Otherwise, it prints `'NO'`.

The function performs the following actions:
1. It reads the values of `n` and `k` from the first line of input.
2. It reads the string representing the sequence of cells.
3. It identifies the positions of the grasshopper (`G`) and the insect (`T`) in the sequence.
4. It calculates the distance between the grasshopper and the insect.
5. It checks if the distance is a multiple of `k`.
6. If the distance is a multiple of `k`, it checks for obstacles along the path. If there are no obstacles, it prints `'YES'`; otherwise, it prints `'NO'`.
7. If the distance is not a multiple of `k`, it immediately prints `'NO'`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If the string does not contain a grasshopper or an insect, the function should handle this case by printing an appropriate message or returning an error.
- The function assumes that the string contains exactly one grasshopper and one insect. If the string contains more than one of either, the function should handle this case appropriately.
- The function does not explicitly check if `n` and `k` are within the specified ranges (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1). This could lead to undefined behavior if invalid input is provided.
- The function does not check if the input string is of length `n`. This could result in incorrect behavior if the string length does not match `n`.
