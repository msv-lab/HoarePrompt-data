Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from working correctly according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead. This will cause syntax errors in Python 3.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Jump Validation**: The logic to validate if the grasshopper can make the required jumps is flawed. Specifically:
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between the positions of 'G' and 'T' is divisible by `k`, but this alone is not sufficient to ensure the grasshopper can reach 'T'.
   - The program reverses the string and checks again, which is unnecessary and can be simplified.

3. **Boundary Conditions Not Properly Handled**: The program does not handle cases where the grasshopper starts or ends its journey near the boundaries of the line, which could affect the validity of the jumps.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    mestok = line.find('G')
    mestot = line.find('T')

    if abs(mestot - mestok) % k == 0:
        steps = abs(mestot - mestok) // k
        cur_pos = mestok
        for _ in range(steps):
            next_pos = cur_pos + k if cur_pos + k <= mestot else cur_pos - k
            if line[next_pos] == '#':
                print('NO')
                return
            cur_pos = next_pos
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version:
- Uses `input()` for Python 3 compatibility.
- Checks the absolute difference between 'G' and 'T' positions and divides by `k` to find the number of jumps needed.
- Iteratively checks each jump position to ensure no obstacles are encountered.
- Prints 'YES' if the path is clear, otherwise prints 'NO'.
