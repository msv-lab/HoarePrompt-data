Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Here are some specific issues:

1. **Input Validation**: The code does not validate the lengths of the input lines or the values of `n` and `k` to ensure they fall within the specified ranges (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1). If invalid input is provided, the code may behave unpredictably.

2. **Multiple Grasshoppers or Insects**: The code assumes there is exactly one grasshopper (`G`) and one insect (`T`) in the input string. However, the problem description does not specify this constraint, and the code should handle multiple instances of `G` and `T` appropriately. If there are multiple `G`s or `T`s, the current implementation may fail.

3. **String Length Mismatch**: The code does not check if the input string is of length `n`. If the string length does not match `n`, the code will produce incorrect results.

Here is an example where the program fails due to the lack of proper validation and handling of multiple instances:

**Example Input:**
```
5 2
G#T#G
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
```

The code does not account for the multiple instances of `G` and `T`, leading to an incorrect output. Additionally, without proper validation, the code may produce unexpected results if the input string length does not match `n` or if `n` and `k` are out of the specified ranges.

To correct these issues, the code should include checks for the length of the input string and the ranges of `n` and `k`. It should also handle multiple instances of `G` and `T` appropriately.
