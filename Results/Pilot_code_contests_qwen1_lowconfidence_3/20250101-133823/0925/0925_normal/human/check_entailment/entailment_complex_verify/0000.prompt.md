You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.

Ostap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.

Your goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.

The second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.

Output

If there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).

Examples

Input

5 2
#G#T#


Output

YES


Input

6 1
T....G


Output

YES


Input

7 3
T..#..G


Output

NO


Input

6 2
..GT..


Output

NO

Note

In the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.

In the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free — he can get there by jumping left 5 times.

In the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.

In the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect.
Program:
```
def func():
    l1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    (n, k) = (l1[0], l1[1])
    l = raw_input()
    mestot = None
    mestok = None
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if l[i] == 'G':
            mestok = i
        if l[i] == 'T':
            mestot = i
        if mestok != None and mestot != None:
            break
    fl = True
    if abs(mestot - mestok) % k == 0:
        for i in range(mestok, len(l), k):
            if l[i] == '#':
                fl = False
                break
        if fl != False and mestot < mestok:
            l = l[::-1]
            for i in range(len(l)):
                if l[i] == 'G':
                    mestok = i
                if l[i] == 'T':
                    mestot = i
            for i in range(mestok, len(l), k):
                if l[i] == '#':
                    fl = False
                    break
        if fl == True:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from working correctly according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead. This will cause syntax errors in Python 3.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Jump Validation**: The logic to validate if the grasshopper can make the required jumps is flawed. Specifically:
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between the positions of 'G' and 'T' is divisible by `k`, but this alone is not sufficient to ensure the grasshopper can reach 'T'.
   - The program reverses the string and checks again, which is unnecessary and can be simplified.

3. **Boundary Conditions Not Properly Handled**: The program does not handle cases where the grasshopper starts or ends its journey near the boundaries of the line, which could affect the validity of the jumps.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    mestok = line.find('G')
    mestot = line.find('T')

    if abs(mestot - mestok) % k == 0:
        steps = abs(mestot - mestok) // k
        cur_pos = mestok
        for _ in range(steps):
            next_pos = cur_pos + k if cur_pos + k <= mestot else cur_pos - k
            if line[next_pos] == '#':
                print('NO')
                return
            cur_pos = next_pos
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version:
- Uses `input()` for Python 3 compatibility.
- Checks the absolute difference between 'G' and 'T' positions and divides by `k` to find the number of jumps needed.
- Iteratively checks each jump position to ensure no obstacles are encountered.
- Prints 'YES' if the path is clear, otherwise prints 'NO'.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The second line is a string of length n containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where '.' represents an empty cell, '#' represents a cell with an obstacle, 'G' represents the grasshopper's starting position, and 'T' represents the insect's position. It is guaranteed that both 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string.

    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a string, `mestok` is the index of the first 'G' in `l` (or `None` if 'G' is not present), `mestot` is the index of the first 'T' in `l` (or `None` if 'T' is not present); `fl` is `False`. If `abs(mestot - mestok) % k == 0`, and if `fl == True` and `mestot < mestok`, the program prints `'YES'`; otherwise, it prints `'NO'`. If `abs(mestot - mestok) % k != 0`, the program remains in the state where `fl` is `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes three inputs: two integers `n` and `k`, and a string representing a sequence of cells where each cell can be one of four types: empty (`.`), obstacle (`#`), grasshopper (`G`), or insect (`T`). The function checks if the grasshopper can jump to the insect following the specified rules. Specifically, it checks if the distance between the grasshopper and the insect, measured in steps of `k`, is a multiple of `k` and if there are no obstacles along the path. If these conditions are met, the function prints `'YES'`, indicating that the grasshopper can reach the insect. Otherwise, it prints `'NO'`.

The function performs the following actions:
1. It reads the values of `n` and `k` from the first line of input.
2. It reads the string representing the sequence of cells.
3. It identifies the positions of the grasshopper (`G`) and the insect (`T`) in the sequence.
4. It calculates the distance between the grasshopper and the insect.
5. It checks if the distance is a multiple of `k`.
6. If the distance is a multiple of `k`, it checks for obstacles along the path. If there are no obstacles, it prints `'YES'`; otherwise, it prints `'NO'`.
7. If the distance is not a multiple of `k`, it immediately prints `'NO'`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If the string does not contain a grasshopper or an insect, the function should handle this case by printing an appropriate message or returning an error.
- The function assumes that the string contains exactly one grasshopper and one insect. If the string contains more than one of either, the function should handle this case appropriately.
- The function does not explicitly check if `n` and `k` are within the specified ranges (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1). This could lead to undefined behavior if invalid input is provided.
- The function does not check if the input string is of length `n`. This could result in incorrect behavior if the string length does not match `n`.
