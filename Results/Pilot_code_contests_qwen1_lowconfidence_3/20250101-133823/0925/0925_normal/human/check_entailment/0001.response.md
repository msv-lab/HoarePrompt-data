Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error when checking for the possibility of the grasshopper reaching the target. Specifically, the program incorrectly checks for the presence of obstacles within the range of jumps without considering the direction of the jumps properly.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
7 3
T..#..G
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

However, the program outputs `YES` because it incorrectly reverses the string and checks again, which does not reflect the original problem constraints.

The program should handle both directions (left and right) of jumps correctly and check for obstacles within the range of each jump. The current implementation does not properly account for the directionality of the jumps, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
