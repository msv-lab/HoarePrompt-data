`mestot` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` is initially 1, `mestot` becomes 1. The values of other variables (`l1`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `mestok`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a string, `mestok` is 1, `i` is 1, and `mestot` is 1.**
