Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `l` is a list.
   - `mestok` is the index of the last 'G' in the list `l` and is less than the length of `l`.
   - `mestot` is the index of the last 'T' in the list `l`.
   - `k` is a positive integer or zero.
   - `i` is initialized to `mestok`.
   - `fl` is `False`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(mestok, len(l), k):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop starts at `mestok` and increments `i` by `k` until `i` is no longer less than `len(l)`.
   - If `l[i]` is '#', then `fl` remains `False`.
   - If `l[i]` is not '#', the postcondition remains unchanged.

4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was at some value `i_prev` (which was less than `len(l)` and incremented by `k`).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i_prev + k` must still be less than `len(l)`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `i` is updated to `i_prev + k` (the new value of `i`).
   - `fl` remains `False` because no '#' was encountered during the last iteration.

6. **Final State:**
   - `l` remains the same.
   - `mestok` remains the same.
   - `mestot` remains the same.
   - `k` remains the same.
   - `i` is now `i_prev + k`.
   - `fl` remains `False`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`l` is a list, `mestok` is the index of the last 'G' in the list `l` and is less than the length of `l`, `mestot` is the index of the last 'T' in the list `l`, `k` is a positive integer or zero, `i` is `mestok + k`, `fl` is `False`.**
