Postcondition: ***`l` must have at least one element. `mestok` is updated to the index of the current element in the list `l` where the loop is currently executing. If the current element is 'T', `mestok` is updated to the index of 'T' and `mestot` is equal to `i`. Otherwise, `mestok` remains unchanged and `mestot` retains its initial value or remains unchanged if 'T' was not found.***
