Postcondition: ***`l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a non-empty string, `mestok` is the index of the first 'G' in `l` (or `None` if 'G' is not present), `mestot` is the index of the first 'T' in `l` (or `None` if 'T' is not present); `fl` is `False`. `mestok` is not `None`, `k` is a positive integer, and the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` modulo `k` is equal to 0. If `l[i]` is equal to '#', the current state remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition is the same as the precondition if the if condition is not met.***
