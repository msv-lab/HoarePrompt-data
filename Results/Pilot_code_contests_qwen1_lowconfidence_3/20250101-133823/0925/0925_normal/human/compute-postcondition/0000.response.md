The code `l1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `l1`. Since the initial state only mentions `n` and `k` as integers with specified ranges, and does not specify their exact values, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `k`. However, we know that the first two integers from the input will be assigned to `n` and `k` respectively.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n` and `k` have been replaced by the first two integers from the input, while the remaining variables retain their initial conditions. The string representing the cells remains unchanged.

Output State: **`l1` is [integer1, integer2, ...], `n` is integer1, `k` is integer2, the string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' is unchanged.**
