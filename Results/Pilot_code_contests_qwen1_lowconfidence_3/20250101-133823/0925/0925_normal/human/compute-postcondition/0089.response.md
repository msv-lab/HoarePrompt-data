The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters directly in the provided function signature. However, based on the problem description, it seems the function should accept two parameters: `n` and `k`, and a string representing a sequence of cells.

- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1.
- The string has a length of `n` and contains characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three inputs: `n`, `k`, and a string, and based on these inputs, perform some operation (which is not specified here).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and a string, where `n` and `k` are integers and the string represents a sequence of cells.**
