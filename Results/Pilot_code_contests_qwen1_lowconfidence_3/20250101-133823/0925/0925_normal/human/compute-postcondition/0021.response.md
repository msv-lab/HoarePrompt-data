Postcondition: ***`l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a string, `mestok` is 1, `i` is 1, and `mestot` is 1. Since the condition `mestok != None and mestot != None` is always true in this case, no changes occur to the variables.***
