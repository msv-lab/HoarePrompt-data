Postcondition: ***`l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a string, `mestok` is 1, and `i` is 1. This is because if `l[i] == 'G'` evaluates to true, `mestok` is set to 1. There is no change to other variables in the else part since no else part is provided.***
