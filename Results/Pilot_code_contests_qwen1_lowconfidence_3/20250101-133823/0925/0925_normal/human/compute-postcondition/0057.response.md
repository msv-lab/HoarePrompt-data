Postcondition: ***`l` must have at least one element, `mestok` is updated to the index of the current element in the list `l` where the loop is currently executing, and `mestot` retains its initial value if no 'T' was found or remains unchanged if it was previously set. If the current element is 'G', `mestok` is updated to the index of this 'G'. Otherwise, `mestok` remains unchanged.***
