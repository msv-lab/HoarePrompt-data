Postcondition: ***`l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a string, `mestok` is 2, `i` is 2, and `mestot` is 1. Since there is no change to the values within the if or else part, the values of `mestok` and `mestot` remain unchanged regardless of the condition.***
