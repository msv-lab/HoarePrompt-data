State: **`l` must be a list, `mestok` is the index of the last 'G' in the list `l`, `mestot` is the index of the last 'T' in the list `l`, `mestok` must be less than the length of `l`, `k` must be a positive integer or zero, and `i` must be initialized to `mestok`**

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **List `l`:** The list `l` must exist and be non-empty.
2. **Index `mestok`:** This is the index of the last 'G' in the list `l`. For the loop to execute, `mestok` must be a valid index, meaning it should be less than the length of `l`.
3. **Index `mestot`:** This is the index of the last 'T' in the list `l`. Its value is not directly relevant to the loop execution but must still be defined.
4. **Step Value `k`:** The step value `k` must be an integer. It must also be such that the loop can progress, implying it should not be negative unless the loop body is designed to handle negative steps. Therefore, it is generally assumed to be a positive integer or zero.
5. **Loop Initialization:** The variable `i` used in the loop must be initialized to `mestok` before the loop starts.

Putting it all together, the required states are:
- `l` must be a list.
- `mestok` must be the index of the last 'G' in the list `l` and must be less than the length of `l`.
- `mestot` is the index of the last 'T' in the list `l`.
- `k` must be a positive integer or zero.
- `i` must be initialized to `mestok`.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`l` must be a list, `mestok` is the index of the last 'G' in the list `l`, `mestok` must be less than the length of `l`, `mestot` is the index of the last 'T' in the list `l`, `k` must be a positive integer or zero, and `i` must be initialized to `mestok`**
