According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `l1`. The loop will execute if `len(l1)` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, we know the following:

- `l1` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is the second element of `l1`.
- `l` is a string.
- `mestok` is `None`.

To ensure the loop can execute, `l1` must have at least one element. This means the length of `l1` should be greater than or equal to 1.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

State: **`l1` is [integer1, integer2, ...] (with at least 1 element), `n` is integer1, `k` is integer2, `l` is a string, `mestok` is None, `i` is 0**

This ensures that the loop can start executing as `i` will be 0 and `len(l1)` will be at least 1.
