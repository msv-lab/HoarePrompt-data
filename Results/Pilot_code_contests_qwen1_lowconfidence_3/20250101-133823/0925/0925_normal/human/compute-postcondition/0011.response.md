Postcondition: ***`l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a string, `mestok` is 0, and `i` is 0; if the element at index `i` in `l1` is 'T', `mestok` remains 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables does not change.***
