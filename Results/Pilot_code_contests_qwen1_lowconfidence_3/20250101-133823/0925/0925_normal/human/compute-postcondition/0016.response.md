The code `mestok = i` assigns the value of `i` to `mestok`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, `mestok` will be set to 1. The values of the other variables (`l1`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `mestok`) are updated accordingly.

Output State: **`l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a string, `mestok` is 1, and `i` is 1**
