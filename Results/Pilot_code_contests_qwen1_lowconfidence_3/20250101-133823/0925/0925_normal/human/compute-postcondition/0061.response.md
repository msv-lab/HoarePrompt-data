`mestok` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` must have at least one element, `mestok` is now equal to `i`, `mestot` retains its previous value, `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`l` must have at least one element, `mestok` is equal to `i`, `mestot` retains its previous value, `i` is incremented by 1**
