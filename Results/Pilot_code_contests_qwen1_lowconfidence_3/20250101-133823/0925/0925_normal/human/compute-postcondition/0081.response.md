Postcondition: ***`l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a non-empty string, `mestok` is the index of the last 'G' in the list `l` and is less than the length of `l`, `mestot` is the index of the last 'T' in the list `l`, `k` is a positive integer or zero, and `fl` is `True`. After all iterations, `i` is the largest multiple of `k` starting from `mestok` such that `i < len(l)` and `l[i] != '#'. If no such `i` exists, `i` is `len(l)`. The condition `fl != False and mestot < mestok` is true.***
