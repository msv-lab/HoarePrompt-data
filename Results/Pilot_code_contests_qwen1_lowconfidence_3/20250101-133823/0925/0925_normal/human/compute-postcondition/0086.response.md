Postcondition: `l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a string, `mestok` is the index of the first 'G' in `l` (or `None` if 'G' is not present), `mestot` is the index of the first 'T' in `l` (or `None` if 'T' is not present); `fl` is `False`, and `abs(mestot - mestok) % k != 0`
