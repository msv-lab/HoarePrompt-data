According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `l1`. The loop condition is `i < len(l1)`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states hold:

- `l1` is a list containing integers and strings.
- `n` is the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is the second element of `l1`.
- `l` is a string.
- `mestok` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- The loop breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional block because `mestok` and `mestot` are not `None`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and should still be less than the length of `l1`.

Let's summarize the new states:
- `l1` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- `k` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- `l` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- `mestok` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than the length of `l1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a string, `mestok` is 0, and `i` is 1**.
