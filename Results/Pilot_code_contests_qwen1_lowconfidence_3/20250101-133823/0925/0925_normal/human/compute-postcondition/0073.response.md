The code `break` does not assign any new values to any variables. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the initial state, the `break` statement does not affect any variables and simply indicates that we would exit the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`fl` remains `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
