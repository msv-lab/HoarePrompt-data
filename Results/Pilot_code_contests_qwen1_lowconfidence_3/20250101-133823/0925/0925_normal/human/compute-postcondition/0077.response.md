The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the loop without changing the values of any variables. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` remains unchanged, `mestok` remains unchanged, `mestot` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `fl` is `False`, `i` is now `i_prev + k`, and we break out of the loop.**
