The variable `fl` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a string, `mestok` is the index of the first 'G' in `l` (or `None` if 'G' is not present), `mestot` is the index of the first 'T' in `l` (or `None` if 'T' is not present); `fl` is `True`.

Output State: **`l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a string, `mestok` is the index of the first 'G' in `l` (or `None` if 'G' is not present), `mestot` is the index of the first 'T' in `l` (or `None` if 'T' is not present); `fl` is `True`**
