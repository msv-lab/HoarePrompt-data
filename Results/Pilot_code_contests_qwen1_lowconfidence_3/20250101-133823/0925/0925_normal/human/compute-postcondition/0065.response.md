Output State: **`l` must be a list, `mestok` is the index of the last 'G' in the list `l`, `mestot` is the index of the last 'T' in the list `l`.**

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: Initially, `mestok` is the index of the last 'G' in the reversed list `l`, and `mestot` is the index of the last 'T' in the reversed list `l`. This is given as part of the initial state.
- **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates through each element of the list `l`. For each iteration:
  - If the current element is 'G', `mestok` is updated to the current index.
  - If the current element is 'T', `mestot` is updated to the current index.
- **Final State**: After all iterations, `mestok` will be the index of the last 'G' in the list `l`, and `mestot` will be the index of the last 'T' in the list `l`. If there are no 'G's or 'T's in the list, `mestok` and `mestot` will retain their initial values.
- **List Condition**: The list `l` must be non-empty for the loop to execute at all.

Thus, after the loop completes, the final state of the variables is that `mestok` is the index of the last 'G' in the list `l`, `mestot` is the index of the last 'T' in the list `l`, and `l` must be a valid list.
