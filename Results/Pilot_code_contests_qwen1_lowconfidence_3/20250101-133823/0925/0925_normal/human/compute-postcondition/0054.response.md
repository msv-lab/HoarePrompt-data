Postcondition: ***`l` must have at least one element, `mestok` is the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in the list `l` or retains its initial value if no 'G' is found, and `mestot` is the index of 'T'. If `l[i]` is 'T', `mestot` is the index of 'T' in the list `l`. Otherwise, `mestok` remains unchanged.***
