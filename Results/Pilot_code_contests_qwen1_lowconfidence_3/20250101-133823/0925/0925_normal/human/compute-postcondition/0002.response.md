The code `l = raw_input()` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `l`. Since `raw_input()` returns a string, `l` is now a string containing the input provided by the user. The initial states of `l1`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l1` is [integer1, integer2, ...], `n` is integer1, `k` is integer2, `l` is a string**
