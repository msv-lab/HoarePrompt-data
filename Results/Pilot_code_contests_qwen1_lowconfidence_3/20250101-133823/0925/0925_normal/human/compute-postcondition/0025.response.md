The code `mestot = i` assigns the value of `i` to `mestot`. From the initial state, we know that `i` is 2. Therefore, `mestot` is updated to 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a string, `mestok` is 2, `i` is 2, and `mestot` is 2.**
