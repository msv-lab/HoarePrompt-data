The code `break` is used to exit a loop or match statement, but since there is no loop or match statement in the given code snippet, it does not affect any variables. The variables `l`, `mestok`, `mestot`, `k`, `i`, and `fl` retain their initial states.

Output State: **`l` is a list, `mestok` is the index of the last 'G' in the list `l` and is less than the length of `l`, `mestot` is the index of the last 'T' in the list `l`, `k` is a positive integer or zero, `i` is initialized to `mestok`, `fl` is `False`**
