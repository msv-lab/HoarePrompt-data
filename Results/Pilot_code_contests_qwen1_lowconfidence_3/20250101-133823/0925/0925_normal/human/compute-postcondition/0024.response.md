Postcondition: ***`l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a string, `mestok` is 2, `i` is 2, and `mestot` is 1. If `l[i]` (which is `l[2]`) equals 'G', then `mestok` is set to 2. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
