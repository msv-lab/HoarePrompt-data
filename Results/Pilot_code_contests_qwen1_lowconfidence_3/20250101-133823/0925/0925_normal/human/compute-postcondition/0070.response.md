Postcondition: ***`l` is a list, `mestok` is the index of the last 'G' in the list `l` and is less than the length of `l`, `mestot` is the index of the last 'T' in the list `l`, `k` is a positive integer or zero, `i` is initialized to `mestok`, `fl` is `False`. If `l[i]` is '#', then `fl` remains `False`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if `l[i]` is not '#'***.
