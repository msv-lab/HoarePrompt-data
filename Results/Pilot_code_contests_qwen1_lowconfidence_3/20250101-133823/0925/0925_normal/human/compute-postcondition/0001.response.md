The code assigns the first element of the list `l1` to `n` and the second element of the list `l1` to `k`. This means that the values of `n` and `k` are updated from their initial states, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l1` is [integer1, integer2, ...], `n` is integer1, `k` is integer2**
