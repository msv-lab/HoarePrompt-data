Postcondition: **`l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a non-empty string, `mestok` is the index of the first 'G' in `l` (or `None` if 'G' is not present), `mestot` is the index of the first 'T' in `l` (or `None` if 'T' is not present), `fl` is `True`, `i` is `mestok + k * (number of full iterations)`, `k` is a positive integer, and the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` modulo `k` is equal to 0. The condition `fl != False and mestot < mestok` is satisfied.**
