Postcondition: ***`l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a string, `mestok` is 0, and `i` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional block because `mestok` and `mestot` are not `None`.***
