The code assigns the value of `i` to `mestok`. Given that the current value of `l[i]` is 'G', this implies that `i` is the index where 'G' is found in the list `l1`. Since the value of `i` is 0 initially, `mestok` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l1` is [integer1, integer2, ...], `n` is integer1, `k` is integer2, `l` is a string, `mestok` is 0, `i` is 0**
