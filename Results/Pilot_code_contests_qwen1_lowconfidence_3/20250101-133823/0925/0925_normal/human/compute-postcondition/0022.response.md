According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `l1`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `l1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `l1` is a list containing integers and strings.
- `n` is the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is the second element of `l1`.
- `l` is a string.
- `mestok` is 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `mestot` is 1.

Since the condition `mestok != None and mestot != None` is always true in this case, no changes occur to the variables.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and checked against the length of `l1`. Therefore, `i` should be 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a string, `mestok` is 1, `i` is 2, and `mestot` is 1.**
