The code `mestot = i` assigns the value of `i` to `mestot`. In the initial state, `mestok` is updated to the index of the current element in the list `l` where the loop is currently executing, and `mestot` retains its initial value if no 'T' was found or remains unchanged if it was previously set. Since the code only updates `mestot` and does not affect `mestok`, `mestok` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`l` must have at least one element, `mestok` is updated to the index of the current element in the list `l` where the loop is currently executing, `mestot` is equal to `i`, and `mestok` remains unchanged.**
