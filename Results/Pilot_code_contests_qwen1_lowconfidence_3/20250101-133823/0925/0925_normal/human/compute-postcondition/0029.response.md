To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states.

### Loop Code Analysis
The loop iterates over each element in the list `l`. For each element, it checks if the element is 'G' or 'T' and updates the respective indices (`mestok` and `mestot`). The loop breaks when both `mestok` and `mestot` are not `None`.

### Key Observations
- `mestok` and `mestot` are updated only when the corresponding characters ('G' or 'T') are found.
- The loop breaks as soon as both `mestok` and `mestot` are set to valid indices.
- If neither 'G' nor 'T' is present in the list, the loop will not break and may continue iterating until the end of the list.

### Output States Provided
- **After 1 iteration**: `mestok` is 0, `i` is 0.
- **After 2 iterations**: `mestok` is 1, `i` is 1, and `mestot` is 1.
- **After 3 iterations**: `mestok` is 2, `i` is 2, and `mestot` is 1.

### Determining the Final State
Given these observations, we can infer the following:

1. **If 'G' and 'T' are present in the list**:
   - `mestok` will be set to the index of the first 'G'.
   - `mestot` will be set to the index of the first 'T'.
   - The loop will break as soon as both `mestok` and `mestot` are not `None`.

2. **If either 'G' or 'T' is not present in the list**:
   - The loop may continue to iterate until the end of the list.
   - `mestok` or `mestot` (or both) will remain `None`.

### Final Output State
- If both 'G' and 'T' are present in the list, the loop will break, and the final values will be `mestok` and `mestot` corresponding to the indices of the first 'G' and 'T', respectively.
- If either 'G' or 'T' is not present, `mestok` or `mestot` will remain `None`.

Thus, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a string, `mestok` is the index of the first 'G' in `l` (or `None` if 'G' is not present), `mestot` is the index of the first 'T' in `l` (or `None` if 'T' is not present).**
