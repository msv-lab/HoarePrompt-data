Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `l1` is a list containing integers and strings.
   - `n` is the first element of `l1`.
   - `k` is the second element of `l1`.
   - `l` is a string.
   - `mestok` is the index of the first 'G' in `l` (or `None` if 'G' is not present).
   - `mestot` is the index of the first 'T' in `l` (or `None` if 'T' is not present).
   - `fl` is `True`.
   - The absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` modulo `k` is equal to 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates from `mestok` to `len(l)` in steps of `k`.

3. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - For the loop to execute, `mestok` must be defined and valid (not `None`).
   - The loop condition `mestok` to `len(l)` ensures that there must be elements in the range to iterate over.
   - The step size `k` should be a positive integer to ensure valid iteration.

4. **Required Adjustments:**
   - Ensure `mestok` is not `None`. If `mestok` is `None`, the loop cannot start.
   - Ensure `k` is a positive integer. A non-positive `k` would make the loop invalid or potentially infinite.
   - Ensure `l` is a non-empty string. An empty string would mean no elements to iterate over, making the loop invalid.

### Conclusion:

The necessary states to adjust for the loop to execute are:
- `mestok` should not be `None`.
- `k` should be a positive integer.
- `l` should be a non-empty string.

Thus, the final state is:

**State: **`l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a non-empty string, `mestok` is the index of the first 'G' in `l` (or `None` if 'G' is not present), `mestot` is the index of the first 'T' in `l` (or `None` if 'T' is not present); `fl` is `True`. `mestok` must not be `None`, `k` must be a positive integer, and the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` modulo `k` is equal to 0.**
