The code assigns the value of `i` to `mestot`. The initial value of `i` is 0. Therefore, `mestot` is set to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a string, `mestok` is 0, and `i` is 0; `mestot` is 0.**
