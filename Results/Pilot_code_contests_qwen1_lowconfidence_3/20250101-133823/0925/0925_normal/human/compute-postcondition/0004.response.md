The code assigns `None` to the variable `mestok`. The value of `mestot` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `l1` is [integer1, integer2, ...], `n` is integer1, `k` is integer2, `l` is a string, `mestok` is `None`.

Output State: **`l1` is [integer1, integer2, ...], `n` is integer1, `k` is integer2, `l` is a string, `mestok` is `None`**
