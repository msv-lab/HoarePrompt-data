The code `mestot = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `mestot`. The previous value of `mestot` is retained, and `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the updated states are:

- `mestot` is now equal to the previous value of `i`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`l` must have at least one element, `mestot` is equal to the previous value of `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
