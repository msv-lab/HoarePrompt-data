The code snippet sets `mestok` to the current value of the loop variable `i`. This means that `mestok` will now hold the index of the current element in the list `l` where the loop is currently executing.

Since the initial state includes that `mestok` is the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in the list `l` or retains its initial value if no 'G' is found, and `mestot` is the index of 'T', this code will update `mestok` but not affect `mestot`.

The output state after the code execution is:

Output State: **`l` must have at least one element, `mestok` is the index of the current element in the list `l` where the loop is currently executing, `mestot` is the index of 'T' if it was previously set, otherwise it retains its initial value.**
