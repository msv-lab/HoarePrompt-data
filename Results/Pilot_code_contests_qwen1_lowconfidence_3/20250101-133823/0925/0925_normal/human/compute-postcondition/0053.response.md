The code assigns the value of `i` to `mestot`. Given that `l[i]` is 'T', the initial value of `mestot` would be the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in the list `l`. Since `mestok` is the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in the list `l`, and no 'G' is found, `mestok` retains its initial value, which means it is still the index of the first 'G' (if there was one) or an unspecified value if no 'G' exists.

After executing `mestot = i`, the value of `mestot` is updated to the value of `i`, which is the index of 'T'. Therefore, `mestok` remains unchanged, and `mestot` now holds the index of 'T'.

Output State: **`l` must have at least one element, `mestok` is the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in the list `l` or retains its initial value if no 'G' is found, `mestot` is the index of 'T', and `l[i]` is 'T'.**
