`fl` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The value of `fl` is now `False`, and the other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` remains unchanged, `mestok` remains unchanged, `mestot` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `fl` is `False`, `i` is now `i_prev + k`, and the loop will continue if `i_prev + 2k < len(l)` and `l[i_prev + k] != '#'`.

Output State: **`l` remains unchanged, `mestok` remains unchanged, `mestot` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `fl` is `False`, `i` is now `i_prev + k`, and the loop will continue if `i_prev + 2k < len(l)` and `l[i_prev + k] != '#'`**
