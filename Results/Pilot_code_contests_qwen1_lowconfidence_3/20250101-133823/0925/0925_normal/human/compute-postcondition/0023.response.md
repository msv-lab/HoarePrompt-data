`mestok` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a string, `mestok` is 2, `i` is 2, and `mestot` is 1.

Output State: **`l1` is a list containing integers and strings, `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is a string, `mestok` is 2, `i` is 2, and `mestot` is 1.**
