The function accepts a list `n` containing two integers representing the number of participants and the number of regions, and a list of strings describing participants in the format (surname, region number, and points scored). It processes the participant data to determine the second and first-place winners for each region. If a region has more than three participants and the third-place score is the same as the first or second place, it marks the region as uncertain ('?'). Otherwise, it appends the names of the first and second-place winners. The function then prints a list of these results for each region, separated by newlines.
