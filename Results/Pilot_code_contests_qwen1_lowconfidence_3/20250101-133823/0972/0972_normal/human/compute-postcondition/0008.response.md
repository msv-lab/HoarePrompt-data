The function `rstrs()` is called and the result is assigned to the variable `a`. The impact of this code on the program is that the variable `a` is updated to the result of `rstrs()`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer read from standard input, the list of strings describing the participants is unchanged, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists with one additional tuple appended to the sublist indexed by `int(a[1])`, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is the result of `rstrs()`**
