The code `n, m = rints()` reads two integers from standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state includes a list `n` containing the number of participants and the number of regions, and a list of strings describing the participants. However, after executing the given code, the list `n` is replaced by the values read from standard input.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, they are represented as `n` and `m` in the output state. The list of strings describing the participants remains unchanged because no operation affects it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from standard input, `m` is an integer read from standard input, the list of strings describing the participants is unchanged**
