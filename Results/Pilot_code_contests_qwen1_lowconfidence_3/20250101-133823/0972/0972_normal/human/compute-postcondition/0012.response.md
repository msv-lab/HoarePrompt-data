`mem[int(a[1])]` is updated to include a new tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`. The value of `a` is returned by `rstrs()`, so `a` holds the specific value returned by `rstrs()`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again; `m` remains unchanged; `mem` remains unchanged; `ans` remains unchanged; `a` holds the value returned by `rstrs()`; `mem[int(a[1])]` is updated to include `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`.
