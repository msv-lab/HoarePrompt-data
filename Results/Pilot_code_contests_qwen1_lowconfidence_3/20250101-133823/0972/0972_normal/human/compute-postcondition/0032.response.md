The code appends a new string to the `ans` list. The string is formatted as '%s %s', which concatenates the second last element's first character (`tem[-2][1]`) and the first character of the last element (`tem[-1][1]`). Since `tem` is equal to `mem[3]` and `mem[3]` is sorted, the characters are taken from the sorted list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `m` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 3
- `mem` is a list of `m + 1` lists with the required structure where `mem[1]` is sorted
- `tem` is now equal to `mem[3]` and has a length greater than 2
- `mem[3]` is sorted
- The third last element's first character is present in either the last element's first character or the second last element's first character
- `ans` is a list where its only element is a string formed by the second last element's first character followed by the first character of the last element

After executing the code:
- `ans` will have two elements: the original element and the new string appended to it.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `m` must be greater than 1; `i` is 3; `mem` is a list of `m + 1` lists with the required structure where `mem[1]` is sorted; `tem` is now equal to `mem[3]` and has a length greater than 2; `mem[3]` is sorted; the third last element's first character is present in either the last element's first character or the second last element's first character; `ans` is a list where its elements are a string formed by the second last element's first character followed by the first character of the last element and the newly appended string '%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1])**
