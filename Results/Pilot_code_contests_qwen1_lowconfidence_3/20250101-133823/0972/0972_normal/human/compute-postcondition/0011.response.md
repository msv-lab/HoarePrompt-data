The code `a = rstrs()` assigns the result of calling the function `rstrs()` to the variable `a`. Since the function `rstrs()` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine its exact output. However, we know that `a` will now hold whatever value this function returns.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `mem`, `ans`, and `a`) remain unchanged except for the new assignment to `a`.

Output State: **`n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again, `m` remains unchanged, `mem` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `a` holds the value returned by `rstrs()`**
