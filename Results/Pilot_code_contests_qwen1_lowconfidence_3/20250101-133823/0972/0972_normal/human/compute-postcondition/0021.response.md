Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is at least 1, `i` is 1, the list of strings describing the participants is unchanged, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` lists with the required structure where `mem[1]` is sorted. If the length of `tem` (which is equal to `mem[1]`) is greater than 2 and the third last element's first character is present in either the last element's first character or the second last element's first character, `ans` is a list where its only element is a string formed by the second last element's first character followed by the first character of the last element. Otherwise, `ans` contains one additional element `'second_element_of_tem first_element_of_tem'`.***
