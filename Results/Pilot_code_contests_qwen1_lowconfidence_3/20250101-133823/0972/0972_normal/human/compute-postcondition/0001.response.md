Output State: **There are two lists provided: one list `n` containing the number of participants (an integer) and the number of regions (an integer), and another list of strings describing the participants in the qualifying competition format (surname, region, and points scored). The lambda function `rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]` is defined, and a new lambda function `rstrs = lambda : [str(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]` is defined.**
