Functionality: **The function accepts a list `n` containing two integers representing the number of participants and the number of regions, and a list of strings describing participants in the format (surname, region number, and points scored). It processes the participant data to determine the second and first-place winners for each region. If a region has more than three participants and the third-place score is the same as the first or second place, it marks the region as uncertain ('?'). Otherwise, it appends the names of the first and second-place winners. The function then prints a list of these results for each region, separated by newlines.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If a region has fewer than three participants, the function will still process the available data and print the available results, marking any region with less than two participants as uncertain ('?') since it cannot have both a first and second-place winner.
- If no participants are provided (i.e., `n` is 0), the function will not modify `mem` or `ans`, and will print an empty list.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not validate the input to ensure that surnames are unique or that each region has at least two participants. This validation should ideally be included to prevent unexpected behavior.
