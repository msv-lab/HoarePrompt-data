Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is `m`, the list of strings describing the participants is unchanged, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` lists where each list contains tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` with `a[1]` being the index, `ans` is a list containing a series of strings based on the conditions inside the loop. If the loop does not execute, `n` must be 0, `mem` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains an empty list. If the loop executes, `ans` contains a series of strings where each string is either `'second_last_element_of_mem[i][1] last_element_of_mem[i][1]'` or `'?'` depending on whether the condition `len(mem[i]) > 2 and mem[i][-3][0] in (mem[i][-1][0], mem[i][-2][0])` holds true for each iteration.**

### Explanation:
- **Variables involved:** `n`, `m`, `mem`, `ans`, and `i`.
- **Loop Execution:** The loop runs from `1` to `m`. For each iteration `i`:
  - `mem[i]` is sorted.
  - If `len(mem[i]) > 2` and `mem[i][-3][0] in (mem[i][-1][0], mem[i][-2][0])`, `ans` appends `'?'`.
  - Otherwise, `ans` appends `'second_last_element_of_mem[i][1] last_element_of_mem[i][1]'`.

- **Final Values:**
  - `n` remains a non-negative integer (unchanged).
  - `m` remains a positive integer (unchanged).
  - `i` becomes `m` after the loop completes.
  - `mem` remains a list of `m + 1` lists with the required structure (unchanged).
  - `ans` contains a series of strings determined by the loop conditions. If the loop did not execute, `ans` remains an empty list.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state is described as above.
