`mem[i]` is sorted, which means the list at index `i` in the `mem` list is sorted. Given that `i` is 2, we sort `mem[2]`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, the list of strings describing the participants is unchanged, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` lists with the required structure where `mem[1]` is sorted, `tem` (which is equal to `mem[1]`) has a length greater than 2, `mem[2]` is sorted, the third last element's first character is present in either the last element's first character or the second last element's first character, `ans` is a list where its only element is a string formed by the second last element's first character followed by the first character of the last element.**
