The code appends a tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` to the sublist in `mem` indexed by `int(a[1])`. Here, `a` is the result of `rstrs()`, which means `a` is a list or tuple obtained from calling `rstrs()`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `m` is an integer read from standard input
- `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists with one additional tuple appended to the sublist indexed by `int(a[1])`
- `ans` is an empty list
- `a` is the result of `rstrs()`

After executing the code:
- The sublist in `mem` indexed by `int(a[1])` now contains one additional tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `m` is an integer read from standard input; `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists with one additional tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` appended to the sublist indexed by `int(a[1])`; `ans` is an empty list; `a` is the result of `rstrs()`**
