The code appends the value `'?'` to the list `ans`. The initial value of `ans` is a list containing a single string formed by the second last element's first character followed by the first character of the last element. After appending `'?'`, the updated `ans` will be a list containing two elements: the original string and `'?'`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, the list of strings describing the participants is unchanged, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` lists with the required structure where `mem[1]` is sorted, `tem` is now equal to `mem[2]` and has a length greater than 2, `mem[2]` is sorted, the third last element's first character is present in either the last element's first character or the second last element's first character, `ans` is a list where its elements are the string formed by the second last element's first character followed by the first character of the last element and `'?'`.**
