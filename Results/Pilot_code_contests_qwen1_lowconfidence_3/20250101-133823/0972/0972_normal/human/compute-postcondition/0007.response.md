According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, it is stated that `n` must be greater than 0.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what happens to `n` during each iteration. Typically, `n` would be decremented by 1 at the beginning of each iteration, assuming the loop body does not change `n`.

Since `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue, and it is decreased by 1 at the start of each iteration, `n` must be reduced by 1 from its current value.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration should have `n` decremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer read from standard input, the list of strings describing the participants is unchanged, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists with one additional tuple appended to the sublist indexed by `int(a[1])`, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is the result of `rstrs()`**
