Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, the list of strings describing the participants is unchanged, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` lists with the required structure where `mem[1]` is sorted, `tem` is now equal to `mem[2]` and has a length greater than 2, `mem[2]` is sorted, the third last element's first character is present in either the last element's first character or the second last element's first character, `ans` is a list where its only element is a string formed by the second last element's first character followed by the first character of the last element. If the condition `len(tem) > 2 and tem[-3][0] in (tem[-1][0], tem[-2][0])` is true, `ans` remains as the string formed by the second last element's first character followed by the first character of the last element. Otherwise, `ans` includes the new string '%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1]).***
