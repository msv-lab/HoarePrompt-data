The provided code snippet is a lambda function definition that reads input from standard input (`stdin`) and splits it into a list of integers. However, the lambda function itself does not execute any operations; it simply defines a function that will be used later to read and parse integer inputs.

Given the initial state:
- There are two lists provided: one list `n` containing the number of participants (an integer) and the number of regions (an integer), and another list of strings describing the participants in the qualifying competition format (surname, region number, and points scored).

The lambda function does not change any of these lists or the values within them. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **There are two lists provided: one list `n` containing the number of participants (an integer) and the number of regions (an integer), and another list of strings describing the participants in the qualifying competition format (surname, region, and points scored). The lambda function `rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]` is defined but has not been called.**
