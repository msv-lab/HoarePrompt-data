`tem` is assigned the value of `mem[i]`. The value of `i` is 1, so `tem` is assigned `mem[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, the list of strings describing the participants is unchanged, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` lists with the required structure where `mem[1]` is sorted, `ans` is an empty list, and `tem` is equal to `mem[1]`.
