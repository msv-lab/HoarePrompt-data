The code appends a formatted string to the `ans` list using the last and second-to-last elements of `tem`. Given the initial state, `tem` is equal to `mem[1]`, which is sorted. The condition specifies that either the length of `tem` is less than or equal to 2 or the third last element of `tem` is not in the last two elements of `tem`. 

Since `tem` is sorted and the third last element cannot be in the last two elements, the length of `tem` must be exactly 2 (if it were longer, the third last element would be part of the last two). Therefore, `tem` contains only two elements.

The formatted string appended to `ans` will be `'%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1])`, which means it will take the second and first elements from `tem` and concatenate their second elements (since `tem` has only two elements, these are the same).

So, the output state is:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `m` must be at least 1.
- `i` is 1.
- The list of strings describing the participants is unchanged.
- `mem` is a list of `m + 1` lists with the required structure where `mem[1]` is sorted.
- `ans` now contains one additional element, which is the formatted string `'second_element_of_tem first_element_of_tem'` (assuming `tem` is `[first_element_of_tem, second_element_of_tem]`).
- `tem` remains equal to `mem[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, the list of strings describing the participants is unchanged, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` lists with the required structure where `mem[1]` is sorted, `ans` is a list containing one additional element `'second_element_of_tem first_element_of_tem'`, `tem` is equal to `mem[1]`.**
