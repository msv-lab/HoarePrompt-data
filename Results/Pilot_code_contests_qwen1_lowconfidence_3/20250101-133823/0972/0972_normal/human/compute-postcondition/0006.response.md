`a` is the result of `rstrs()`, which means `a` is a list. The first element of `a` is `a[1]`, which is used to index into `mem`. The last element of `a` is `a[-1]`, which is converted to an integer and appended as a tuple to the sublist in `mem` indexed by `int(a[1])`. The value of `mem` is updated accordingly, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer read from standard input, the list of strings describing the participants is unchanged, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists with one additional tuple appended to the sublist indexed by `int(a[1])`, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is the result of `rstrs()`**
