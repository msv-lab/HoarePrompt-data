Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `m` is an integer read from standard input.
   - `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists with one additional tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` appended to the sublist indexed by `int(a[1])`.
   - `ans` is an empty list.
   - `a` is the result of `rstrs()`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates `n` times, as specified by the line `for _ in range(n):`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `n` was greater than 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 again.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop condition checks if `n` is greater than 1, and it is already true, `n` remains unchanged at the start of the next iteration.
   - `m`, `mem`, `ans`, and `a` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless explicitly modified within the loop.

5. **Final State:**
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.
   - `m` remains unchanged.
   - `mem` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `m` is an integer read from standard input; `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists with one additional tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` appended to the sublist indexed by `int(a[1])`; `ans` is an empty list; `a` is the result of `rstrs()`**
