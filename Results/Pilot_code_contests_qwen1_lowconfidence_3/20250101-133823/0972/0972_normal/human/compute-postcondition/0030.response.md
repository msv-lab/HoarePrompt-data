The code `tem = mem[i]` assigns the list `mem[i]` to the variable `tem`. Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 3.
- `mem` is a list of `m + 1` lists with specific structures.
- `tem` is currently equal to `mem[2]`.

Since `i` is 3, `mem[i]` corresponds to `mem[3]`. Therefore, `tem` is now set to `mem[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3, the list of strings describing the participants is unchanged, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` lists with the required structure where `mem[1]` is sorted, `tem` is now equal to `mem[3]` and has a length greater than 2, `mem[3]` is sorted, the third last element's first character is present in either the last element's first character or the second last element's first character, `ans` is a list where its only element is a string formed by the second last element's first character followed by the first character of the last element.**
