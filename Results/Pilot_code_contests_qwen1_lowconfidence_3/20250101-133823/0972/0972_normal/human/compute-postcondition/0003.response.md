The code initializes two variables: `mem` is a list of empty lists with a length of `m + 1`, and `ans` is an empty list. This does not affect the values of `n` or `m`, nor does it change the list of strings describing the participants.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from standard input, `m` is an integer read from standard input, the list of strings describing the participants is unchanged, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists, `ans` is an empty list**
