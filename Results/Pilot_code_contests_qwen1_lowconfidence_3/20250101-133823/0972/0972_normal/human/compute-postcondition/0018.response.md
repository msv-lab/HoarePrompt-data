The code appends the string `'?'` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` is an empty list, so after appending `'?'`, the list `ans` will contain this single element.

All other variables remain unchanged:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `m` is at least 1.
- `i` is 1.
- The list of strings describing the participants remains unchanged.
- `mem` is a list of `m + 1` lists with the required structure where `mem[1]` is sorted.
- `ans` is now `[? ]`.
- `tem` is equal to `mem[1]` and its length is greater than 2 with the third last element's first character being present in either the last element's first character or the second last element's first character.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is at least 1, `i` is 1, the list of strings describing the participants is unchanged, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` lists with the required structure where `mem[1]` is sorted, `ans` is `[? ]`, `tem` is equal to `mem[1]` and its length is greater than 2 with the third last element's first character being present in either the last element's first character or the second last element's first character.**
