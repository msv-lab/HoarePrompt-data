The code `mem[i].sort()` sorts the list at index `i` of the list `mem`. Since `i` is initialized to 1 and `mem` is a list of `m + 1` lists, the list `mem[1]` is sorted in place. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, the list of strings describing the participants is unchanged, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` lists with the required structure where `mem[1]` is sorted, `ans` is an empty list.**
