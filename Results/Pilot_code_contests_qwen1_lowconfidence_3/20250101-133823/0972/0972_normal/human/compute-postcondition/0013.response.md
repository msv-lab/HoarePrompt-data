Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is an integer read from standard input, the list of strings describing the participants is unchanged, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` lists where each list contains tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` with `a[1]` being the index, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is the result of `rstrs()` if the loop executed at least once. If the loop did not execute, `n` must be 0, `mem` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains an empty list.**
