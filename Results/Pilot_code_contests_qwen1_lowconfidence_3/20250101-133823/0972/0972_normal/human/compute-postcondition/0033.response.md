Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3, the list of strings describing the participants is unchanged, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` lists with the required structure where `mem[1]` is sorted, `tem` is now equal to `mem[3]` and has a length greater than 2, `mem[3]` is sorted. If the third last element's first character is present in either the last element's first character or the second last element's first character, `ans` is a list where its elements are a string formed by the second last element's first character followed by the first character of the last element and either `'?'` or the newly appended string '%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1]). Otherwise, `ans` is a list where its elements are a string formed by the second last element's first character followed by the first character of the last element.***
