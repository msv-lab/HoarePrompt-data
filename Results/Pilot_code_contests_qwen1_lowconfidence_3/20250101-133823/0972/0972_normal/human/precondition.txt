n and m are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10 000, and n ≥ 2m. Each of the next n lines contains a string (representing the surname of a participant), an integer (representing the region number), and an integer (representing the number of points scored by the participant) separated by spaces.
