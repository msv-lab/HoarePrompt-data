Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the code fails to handle cases where the top three scores in a region are equal. According to the problem description, if a region has more than two participants and the third-highest score is the same as the first or second-highest score, the team cannot be uniquely determined. However, the code only checks if the third-highest score is the same as the first or second-highest score and does not account for the scenario where the third-highest score is exactly the same as the first or second-highest score. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
5 2
Ivanov 1 800
Andreev 2 763
Petrov 1 800
Sidorov 1 800
Semenov 2 503
```

The code will output:

```
?
Andreev Semenov
```

However, for region 1, the top three scores are 800, 800, and 800, which means there are multiple possible teams. Therefore, the correct output for region 1 should be `?`.

To fix this, the code needs to check if the third-highest score is strictly less than the highest score before deciding whether to mark the region as uncertain.
