Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine the team members for each region based on the problem description. Specifically, the code does not ensure that the team members cannot be replaced by any other participant from the same region who scored higher points. Instead, the code simply selects the top two scorers in each region and checks if the third-highest scorer has the same score as the top two. This approach fails to consider whether the top two scorers can indeed be replaced by any other participant from the same region who scored higher points.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5 2
Ivanov 1 800
Andreev 2 763
Petrov 1 800
Sidorov 1 800
Semenov 2 503
```

The code will output:
```
?
Andreev Semenov
```

However, in region 1, the top three scorers are Ivanov, Petrov, and Sidorov, all with 800 points. According to the problem description, the team should consist of the two highest-scoring participants who cannot be replaced by any other participant from the same region with a higher score. In this case, both Ivanov and Petrov (or Sidorov) can be replaced by Sidorov (or Petrov respectively), since they all have the same score. Therefore, the team selection is ambiguous, and the correct output should be "?". The code does not handle this case correctly.
