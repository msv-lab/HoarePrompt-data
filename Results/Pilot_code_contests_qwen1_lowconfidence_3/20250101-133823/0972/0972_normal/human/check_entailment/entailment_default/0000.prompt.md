You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

Output hints: The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation:The code originally looks correct. The function hints agree with the code and with their help we determine that the code indeed follows the problem description. the function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints: The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect and not follow the problem description. We also see that the output hints agree with the code and they also help prove that the code is incorrect.  The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Output hints: The function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. If the taget is at the last index it wont be found as the loop will break before reaching the last index.

Example answer 3:
Explanation: Originnaly the code looks correct but after confirming that the output hints agree with the code,we can see the function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the list. However, the termination condition of the while loop is `left < right`, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely when `left` is equal to `right`. This condition can lead to missing the target element if it is at the last index of the list. Also when left and right are adjacent then mid will always be left leading to infinate loop.
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Very soon Berland will hold a School Team Programming Olympiad. From each of the m Berland regions a team of two people is invited to participate in the olympiad. The qualifying contest to form teams was held and it was attended by n Berland students. There were at least two schoolboys participating from each of the m regions of Berland. The result of each of the participants of the qualifying competition is an integer score from 0 to 800 inclusive.

The team of each region is formed from two such members of the qualifying competition of the region, that none of them can be replaced by a schoolboy of the same region, not included in the team and who received a greater number of points. There may be a situation where a team of some region can not be formed uniquely, that is, there is more than one school team that meets the properties described above. In this case, the region needs to undertake an additional contest. The two teams in the region are considered to be different if there is at least one schoolboy who is included in one team and is not included in the other team. It is guaranteed that for each region at least two its representatives participated in the qualifying contest.

Your task is, given the results of the qualifying competition, to identify the team from each region, or to announce that in this region its formation requires additional contests.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10 000, n ≥ 2m) — the number of participants of the qualifying contest and the number of regions in Berland.

Next n lines contain the description of the participants of the qualifying contest in the following format: Surname (a string of length from 1 to 10 characters and consisting of large and small English letters), region number (integer from 1 to m) and the number of points scored by the participant (integer from 0 to 800, inclusive).

It is guaranteed that all surnames of all the participants are distinct and at least two people participated from each of the m regions. The surnames that only differ in letter cases, should be considered distinct.

Output

Print m lines. On the i-th line print the team of the i-th region — the surnames of the two team members in an arbitrary order, or a single character "?" (without the quotes) if you need to spend further qualifying contests in the region.

Examples

Input

5 2
Ivanov 1 763
Andreev 2 800
Petrov 1 595
Sidorov 1 790
Semenov 2 503


Output

Sidorov Ivanov
Andreev Semenov


Input

5 2
Ivanov 1 800
Andreev 2 763
Petrov 1 800
Sidorov 1 800
Semenov 2 503


Output

?
Andreev Semenov

Note

In the first sample region teams are uniquely determined.

In the second sample the team from region 2 is uniquely determined and the team from region 1 can have three teams: "Petrov"-"Sidorov", "Ivanov"-"Sidorov", "Ivanov" -"Petrov", so it is impossible to determine a team uniquely.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rstrs = lambda : [str(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    (n, m) = rints()
    (mem, ans) = ([[] for _ in range(m + 1)], [])
    for _ in range(n):
        a = rstrs()
        mem[int(a[1])].append((int(a[-1]), a[0]))
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        mem[i].sort()
        tem = mem[i]
        if len(tem) > 2 and tem[-3][0] in (tem[-1][0], tem[-2][0]):
            ans.append('?')
        else:
            ans.append('%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1]))
    print('\n'.join(ans))


```
Output hints: The function accepts a list `n` containing two integers representing the number of participants and the number of regions, and a list of strings describing participants in the format (surname, region number, and points scored). It processes the participant data to determine the second and first-place winners for each region. If a region has more than three participants and the third-place score is the same as the first or second place, it marks the region as uncertain ('?'). Otherwise, it appends the names of the first and second-place winners. The function then prints a list of these results for each region, separated by newlines.

Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
