Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify the team from each region according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where there are multiple valid teams that can be formed from the same region. The program checks if the third-highest score is equal to the highest or second-highest score, but this condition is not sufficient to determine if there are multiple valid teams.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5 2
Ivanov 1 800
Andreev 2 763
Petrov 1 800
Sidorov 1 800
Semenov 2 503
```

According to the problem description, for region 1, there are three possible teams:
1. "Ivanov" - "Petrov"
2. "Ivanov" - "Sidorov"
3. "Petrov" - "Sidorov"

Since there are multiple valid teams, the output should be `?`. However, the provided program outputs:

```
Ivanov Petrov
Andreev Semenov
```

This indicates that the program does not correctly identify the scenario where multiple valid teams exist. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
