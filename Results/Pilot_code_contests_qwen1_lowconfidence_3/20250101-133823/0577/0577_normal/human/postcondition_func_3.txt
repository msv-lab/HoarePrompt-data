The function `func_4` reads input from the standard input, processes it, and returns an iterator of strings. The input consists of multiple test cases, each described by a string consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. The function splits the input string by spaces, converts each token to a string (though this conversion is redundant since the tokens are already strings), and then maps these tokens into an iterator. There are no edge cases explicitly handled in the provided code, and the function assumes that the input will always consist of valid 'A' and 'B' characters separated by spaces.
