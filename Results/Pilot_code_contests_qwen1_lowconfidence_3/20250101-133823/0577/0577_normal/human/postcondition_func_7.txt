The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `l`, which is a list of strings composed of characters 'A' and 'B'. It returns a new list of these strings sorted in descending order based on a custom key 'getKey'. The function uses the `sorted` function with the `key=getKey` argument and `reverse=True` to achieve this sorting. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the provided code does not include any missing functionality. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the program returns a list of strings from `l` sorted in descending order based on the custom key 'getKey'.
