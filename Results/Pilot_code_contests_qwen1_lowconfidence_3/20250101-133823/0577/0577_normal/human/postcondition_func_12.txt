The function `func_13` accepts two parameters: `x` (a non-negative integer) and `y` (a positive integer). It returns either `x // y` if `x` is divisible by `y`, or `x // y + 1` if `x` is not divisible by `y`. This ensures that the returned value is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x / y`. There are no apparent edge cases missing from the provided code; however, the function correctly handles the condition where `x` is not divisible by `y` by returning `x // y + 1`.
