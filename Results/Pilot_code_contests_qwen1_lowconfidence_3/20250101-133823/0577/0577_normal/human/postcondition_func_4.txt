The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list generated by calling `func_3()`. After the function executes, it leaves the program in a state where it contains a list that is the result of processing some input strings according to the rules defined in `func_3()`. There are no specific actions mentioned in the annotations that contradict the actual code. However, it is important to note that the function assumes `func_3()` returns an iterable object, which could be an empty iterable or an iterable containing elements based on the input strings processed by the rules in `func_3()`.
