This function sets the recursion limit and thread stack size to allow for higher recursion depth and larger stack size, then starts a new thread to run the `main` function. The function itself does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function executes, the program will have a new thread running the `main` function with the specified settings for recursion limit and stack size. There are no explicit return values or postconditions provided, but the function prepares the environment for the `main` function to run in a separate thread with enhanced resource limits.
