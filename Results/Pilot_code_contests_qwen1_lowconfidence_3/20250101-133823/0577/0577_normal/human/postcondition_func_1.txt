The function `func_2` reads a single line of input from the standard input, expecting the input to be a string consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. It then returns this string. If no input is provided or if the input is not a valid string of 'A' and 'B', the behavior is undefined since the code does not handle these cases. Potential edge cases include empty input or non-'A' and non-'B' characters in the input.
