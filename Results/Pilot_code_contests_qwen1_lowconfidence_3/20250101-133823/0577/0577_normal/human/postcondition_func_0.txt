The function `func_1()` reads an integer input from the user and returns that integer. The function assumes that the input provided by the user is a valid integer. If the user provides a non-integer input, the function will raise a `ValueError`. There are no additional actions performed by the function beyond reading the input and returning it. The function does not handle any edge cases where the input might be empty or null, as it directly returns the input value without any further processing.
