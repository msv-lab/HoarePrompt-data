The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of rows), `m` (a positive integer representing the number of columns), and `num` (an integer that will initialize all elements in the 2D list). It returns a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is initialized to `num`. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly; however, it assumes that `n`, `m`, and `num` are valid inputs (i.e., `n` and `m` are positive integers, and `num` is an integer). There are no missing functionalities in the provided code.
