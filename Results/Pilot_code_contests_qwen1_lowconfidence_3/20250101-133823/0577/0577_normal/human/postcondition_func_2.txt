The function `func_3()` reads a single line of input from the standard input, strips leading and trailing whitespace, splits the input string into individual tokens based on spaces, converts each token into an integer using the `map` function, and returns a map object containing these integers. This function does not accept any parameters. It handles the scenario where the input string might contain multiple space-separated integers. If the input is empty or only contains whitespace, the map object will be empty. However, if the input contains non-integer values or is not properly formatted (e.g., mixed with other characters), the function will raise a `ValueError`.
