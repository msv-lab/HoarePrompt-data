The function `func_7` accepts a single parameter `item`, which must be either a tuple or a list containing at least two elements. The function returns the second element (`item[1]`) of the provided `item`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, and the code accurately reflects the described behavior. Therefore, the function simply extracts and returns the second element from the given tuple or list.
