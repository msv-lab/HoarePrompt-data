The function `func_17` does not accept any parameters and modifies the standard input and output streams of the Python program. It opens 'input.txt' for reading and 'output.txt' for writing, effectively redirecting the input and output operations to these files instead of the console. This change in the streams is intended to facilitate reading from 'input.txt' and writing to 'output.txt' during the execution of subsequent functions or code blocks. There are no return values, and the state of the program after the function concludes will have the standard input redirected to 'input.txt' and the standard output redirected to 'output.txt'.
