The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` impacts the `file` variable by writing the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to it. Since the initial state does not specify a value for `kwargs`, we consider the default value provided in the function call, which is `\n`.

Given that `at_start` is initially `False`, no changes occur to `sep` or `file` during this line of code. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `args` remains a list with exactly `t` elements, each being a non-empty string consisting of 'A' and 'B'.

The only change is that the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` is written to `file`. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `kwargs`, the most general form of the updated state is that `\n` is written to `file`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `args` is a list with exactly `t` elements, each element being a non-empty string consisting of 'A' and 'B'; `sep` is the separator used between elements (determined during the loop execution based on the first iteration where `at_start` is `False`); `file` has had the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` (which is `\n`) written to it; `at_start` is `False`.**
