The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of `t`, `s`, `sep`, or `file`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 20000), and each test case is a non-empty string `s` consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B' (the length of `s` does not exceed 2 * 10^5); `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` or ' '; `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is True.**
