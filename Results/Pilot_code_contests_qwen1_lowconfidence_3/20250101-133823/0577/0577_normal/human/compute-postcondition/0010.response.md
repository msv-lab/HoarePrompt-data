The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. Since the condition `not at_start` is true, `sep` will be written to the file. The other variables (`t`, `args`, `at_start`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `args` is a list with at least `t` elements, `at_start` is False, `sep` is written to the file**
