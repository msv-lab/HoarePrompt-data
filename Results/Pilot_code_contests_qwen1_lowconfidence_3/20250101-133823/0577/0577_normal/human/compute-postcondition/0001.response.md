The code snippet `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the `'sep'` and `'file'` keys and assigning their values to `sep` and `file` respectively. If the keys do not exist in `kwargs`, they default to `' '` and `sys.stdout` respectively.

Given the initial state where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and each test case is a non-empty string `s` consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B', this code does not affect the values of `t` or `s`. It only modifies the `kwargs` dictionary and sets `sep` and `file`.

Since the values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged, and the new values for `sep` and `file` are set but not specifically quantified, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 20000), and each test case is a non-empty string `s` consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B' (the length of `s` does not exceed 2 * 10^5); `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` or ' '; `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`.**
