Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop structure**: The loop iterates over the elements of `args`.
2. **Understand the variables involved**: 
   - `t` is the number of test cases, with constraints \(1 \leq t \leq 20000\).
   - Each test case is a non-empty string `s` consisting of 'A' and 'B'.
   - `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` or ' '.
   - `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`.
   - `at_start` is True.

3. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `args` must contain at least one element.
   - `t` represents the number of test cases, but since the loop is iterating over `args`, we need to ensure that `args` has at least `t` elements.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `args` must be a list with at least `t` elements.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `t` must be at least 1.
- `args` must be a list containing at least `t` elements.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `args` is a list with at least `t` elements**
