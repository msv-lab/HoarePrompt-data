The line `at_start = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `at_start`. This changes the value of `at_start` but does not affect the values of `t` or `args`. The initial state condition that `t` is at least 1 and `args` is a list with at least `t` elements remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `args` is a list with at least `t` elements, and `at_start` is `False`**
