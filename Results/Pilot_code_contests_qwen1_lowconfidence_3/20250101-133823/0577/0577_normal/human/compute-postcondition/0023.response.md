Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `args` is a list with exactly `t` elements, each element being a non-empty string consisting of 'A' and 'B', `sep` is the separator used between elements (determined during the loop execution based on the first iteration where `at_start` is `False`), `file` has had the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` (which is `\n`) written to it, `at_start` is `False`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, the write buffer for the file object `file` has been flushed.***
