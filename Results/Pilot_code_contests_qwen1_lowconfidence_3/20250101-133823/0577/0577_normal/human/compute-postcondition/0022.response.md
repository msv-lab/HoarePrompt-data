The code `file.flush()` flushes the write buffer for the file object `file`. However, since no specific action or value is returned by this operation and no other variables are affected by this line of code, the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `args` is a list with exactly `t` elements, each element being a non-empty string consisting of 'A' and 'B', `sep` is the separator used between elements (determined during the loop execution based on the first iteration where `at_start` is `False`), `file` has had the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` (which is `\n`) written to it, `at_start` is `False`, and `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, and the write buffer for the file object `file` has been flushed.**
