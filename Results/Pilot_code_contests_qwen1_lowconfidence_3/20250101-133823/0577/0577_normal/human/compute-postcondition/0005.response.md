The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file `file`. However, the code does not change the values of the variables `t` or `args`, nor does it change the boolean value of `at_start`. Therefore, the only affected state is that `sep` is written to the file.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `args` is a list with at least `t` elements, the condition `not at_start` is true, `sep` is written to the file.**
