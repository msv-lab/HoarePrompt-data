According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. For the loop to execute again, `args` must have at least `t + 1` elements since `t` is at least 1.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is at least 1.
- `args` is a list with at least `t` elements.
- `at_start` is `False`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The list `args` must have at least `t + 1` elements.

Therefore, we update the state as follows:
State: **`t` is at least 2, `args` is a list with at least `t` elements, and `at_start` is `False`**
