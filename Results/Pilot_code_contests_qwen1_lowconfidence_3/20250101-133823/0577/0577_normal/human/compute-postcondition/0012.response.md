`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. The initial state includes that `t` is at least 1, `args` is a list with at least `t` elements, and `at_start` is `False`. If `not at_start` is true (which it is in this case), then `sep` is written to the file. The code does not affect `t`, `args`, `at_start`, or `sep`, but it does write `str(x)` to the file.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `args` is a list with at least `t` elements, and `at_start` is `False`; `str(x)` is written to the file.**
