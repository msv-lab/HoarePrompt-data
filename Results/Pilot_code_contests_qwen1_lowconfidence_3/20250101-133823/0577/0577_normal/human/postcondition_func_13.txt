The function `func_14` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `p` are non-negative integers and `p` is greater than 1. It calculates the result of `x^y % p` using an efficient algorithm known as "Exponentiation by Squaring". The function iteratively squares the base `x` and reduces the exponent `y` until `y` becomes zero. During this process, if the current bit of `y` is set (i.e., odd), it multiplies the result by the current value of `x` and then reduces the result modulo `p`. The function finally returns the computed result, which is the remainder when `x^y` is divided by `p`.
