The function does not take any parameters and it is intended to be used within the context of the main program to read input. The input consists of multiple test cases, where each test case starts with an integer t representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each containing a non-empty string s consisting of 'A' and 'B' characters. The function itself is not part of the solution to the problem described but is a utility function for reading input.
