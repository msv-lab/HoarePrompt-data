The provided function `func_19` is not related to solving the problem described. It is a helper function that prints values to a stream or the standard output. Therefore, we cannot derive the precondition from this function directly since it does not contribute to the logic needed to solve the problem.

However, based on the problem description and the input/output examples, we can derive the precondition for the problem itself:

Precondition: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 20000), and each test case is a non-empty string s consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B' (the length of s does not exceed 2 * 10^5).**
