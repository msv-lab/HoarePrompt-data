The function `func_12` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list of its digits as individual integers. The function correctly converts the integer `n` into a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string, converts each character back into an integer, and collects these integers into a list. This process works for all non-negative integers, including edge cases such as `0`, which results in a list containing a single element `[0]`. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code.
