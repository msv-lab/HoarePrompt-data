`c` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `c` is updated to `0`, `d` retains its original value, and `s` is the original `s` plus 'G'. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `c` is `0`, `d` is the original value of `d`, and `s` is the original `s` plus 'G'.

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `c` is `0`, `d` is the original value of `d`, and `s` is the original `s` plus 'G'.**
