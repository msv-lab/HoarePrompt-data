Postcondition: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `c` is 0, `d` is either the original value or its opposite depending on the condition `d`, and `s` is either the original `s` plus 'G' or 'B'.** 

Explanation:
- If `d` is true (i.e., `d` is the opposite of its original value), then:
  - `c` is 0.
  - `s` is the original `s` plus 'G'.
- If `d` is false (i.e., `d` reverts to its original value), then:
  - `b` is `b - 1`.
  - `c` is 0.
  - `d` is the opposite of its original value.
  - `s` is 'B'.
  - The final value of `b` is less than `a`.

In both cases, `c` is 0, and `d` is either the original value or its opposite, while `s` changes based on the condition of `d`.
