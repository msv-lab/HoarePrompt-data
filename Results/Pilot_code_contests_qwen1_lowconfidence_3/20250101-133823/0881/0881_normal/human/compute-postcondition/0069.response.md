The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. The initial state shows that `c` is 1, so after executing the code, `c` will be `1 + 1`, which is `2`. The values of the other variables (`k`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s`, and the condition about `d`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is 2, `s` is `s` plus 'B', `a` is decreased by 1 if `d` is the opposite of its original value, and `b` is decreased by 1, and no conditions cause 'NO' to be printed.**
