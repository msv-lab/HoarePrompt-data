`b` is decremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is 0, `d` is the opposite of its original value, and `s` is either the original `s` plus 'GB' or 'BB'; `b` is decreased by 1.
