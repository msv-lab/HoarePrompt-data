Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^5\); `k` is the second element of `vals`; `a` is equal to `vals[2]`; `b` is the fourth element of `vals`; `vals` is a list of integers equal to the input split and converted to integers; `c` is 0; `d` is `True`. The current value of `b` is greater than `a`.**
