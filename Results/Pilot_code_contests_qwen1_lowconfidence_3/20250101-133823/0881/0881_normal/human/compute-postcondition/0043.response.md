The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `c` is 0, so after the code execution, `c` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is 1, `d` is the opposite of its original value, and `s` is either the original `s` plus 'GG' or 'BG'; `a` is decreased by 1.**
