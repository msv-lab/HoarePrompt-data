`c` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `c` is 1 more than its original value, which was 0. The original value of `k` is now the second element of `vals`, `n` is still greater than or equal to `k`, `d` is the opposite of its original value, and `s` is the original `s` plus `'G'`. The value of `a` is not directly used in this operation, but it is mentioned that `a` is `a - 1` in the initial state, which means `a` has a reduced value.

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `c` is 1, `d` is the opposite of its original value, and `s` is the original `s` plus `'G'`; `a` is `a - 1`.**
