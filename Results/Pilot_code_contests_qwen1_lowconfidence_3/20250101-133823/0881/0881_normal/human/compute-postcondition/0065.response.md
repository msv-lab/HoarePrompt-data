`c` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `c` was previously `1`, so it changes to `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is 0, `s` is now `s + 'G'`, `a` is `a - 1`, `b` is decreased by 1 otherwise, `d` is the opposite of its original value**
