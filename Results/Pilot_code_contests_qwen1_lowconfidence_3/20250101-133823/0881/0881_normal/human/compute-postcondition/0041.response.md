`s` is updated by adding 'G' to its current value. The initial conditions state that `s` is either the original `s` plus 'G' or 'B'. Since `s` is already in one of these forms, adding 'G' to it will maintain the form. The value of `k`, `n`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is 0, `d` is the opposite of its original value, and `s` is either the original `s` plus 'GG' or 'BG'.**
