The code `quit()` causes the program to exit immediately without further execution of any subsequent statements. Since no variables are updated or reassigned within this statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `c` is 0, `d` is either the original value or its opposite depending on the condition `(a < 0 or b < 0)`, and `s` is either the original `s` plus 'G' or 'B'. We print 'NO' to the console.**
