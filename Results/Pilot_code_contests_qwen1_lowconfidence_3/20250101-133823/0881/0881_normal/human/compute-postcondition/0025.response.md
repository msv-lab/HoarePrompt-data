`s` is assigned the value of `'B'` and added to the existing value of `s`. Since the initial value of `s` is not specified, let's assume it starts as an empty string (`''`). Therefore, after the operation, `s` becomes `'B'`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `c` is 0, `d` remains unchanged, `s` is `'B'`**
