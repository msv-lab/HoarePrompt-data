Postcondition: ***`k` is the second element of `vals`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is 0, `s` is either the original `s` plus 'GG', 'BG', 'GB', or 'BB', depending on the value of `d`, `a` is decreased by 1 if `d` is the opposite of its original value, and `b` is decreased by 1 otherwise. If `a < 0` or `b < 0`, the console prints 'NO'; if `c == k`, then `d` is now the opposite of its original value.***
