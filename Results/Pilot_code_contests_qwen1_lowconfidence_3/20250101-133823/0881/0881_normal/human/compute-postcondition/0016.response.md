Postcondition: ***`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `c` is 0. If `c` equals `k`, then `d` is the opposite of its original value. Since the if condition checks if `d` is true, `d` remains true if it was originally true, and false if it was originally false.***
