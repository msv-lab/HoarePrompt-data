`n` is assigned the value of `vals[0]`, which means `n` takes the first element from the list `vals`. The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `vals` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a + b = n, `b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a + b = n, and `vals` is a list of integers equal to the input split and converted to integers; `n` is now set to the first element of `vals`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a + b = n, `b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a + b = n, and `vals` is a list of integers equal to the input split and converted to integers; `n` is now set to the first element of `vals`**
