Postcondition: ***`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is 0, `d` is the opposite of its original value, and `s` is either the original `s` plus 'GG' or 'BG'; `a` is decreased by 1. This is because if `a < b` is true, then `c` is set to 0. Regardless of whether `a < b` is true or false, the else part does not change any variables, so the overall postcondition follows the if part's assignment.***
