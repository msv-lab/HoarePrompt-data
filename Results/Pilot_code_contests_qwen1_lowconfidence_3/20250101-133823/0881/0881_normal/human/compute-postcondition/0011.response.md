To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `k` is the second element of `vals`.
   - `a` is equal to `vals[2]`.
   - `b` is the fourth element of `vals`.
   - `vals` is a list of integers equal to the input split and converted to integers.
   - `c` is 0.
   - `d` is `False` if `b > a`, otherwise `d` remains `True`.
   - `s` is an empty string.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`.
   - This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `1 <= k <= n <= 10^5` must hold true.
   - Since `k` is the second element of `vals`, `k` must exist within the list `vals`.
   - `n` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Ensure `n` is greater than or equal to `k` (since `k` is the second element of `vals` and `n` is the upper bound of the range).
   - Ensure `k` exists in `vals` as the second element.
   - Ensure `n` is within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `k` must be the second element of `vals`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.
- `n` must be within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).

Given these conditions, the modified state should be:

State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `n` must be within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)**
