The code assigns the value of `vals[2]` to the variable `a`. According to the initial state, `vals` is a list of integers, and `k` is the second element of `vals`, meaning `vals[1] = k`. However, the code accesses `vals[2]`, which is the third element of the list. Since the initial state does not specify what `vals[2]` is, we cannot determine the exact value of `a`. But we know that `a` is assigned the value of `vals[2]`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, and `vals`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is the second element of `vals`, `a` is equal to `vals[2]`, `b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a + b = n, and `vals` is a list of integers equal to the input split and converted to integers.**
