The `quit()` function call ends the current process and does not return any value. All variables remain in their last known state before the function call. The console prints 'NO', but this is a side effect and not a variable state change.

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is 0, and `s` is either the original `s` plus 'GG' or 'BG' or 'GB' or 'BB'. Depending on the value of `d`, `a` is decreased by 1 if `d` is the opposite of its original value, and `b` is decreased by 1 otherwise. The console prints 'NO'**
