`s` is updated by appending 'B' to its current value. Since `s` is either the original `s` plus 'G' or 'B', and now 'B' is appended, the new value of `s` will be either the original `s` plus 'GB' or 'BB'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is 0, `d` is the opposite of its original value, and `s` is either the original `s` plus 'GB' or 'BB'.**
