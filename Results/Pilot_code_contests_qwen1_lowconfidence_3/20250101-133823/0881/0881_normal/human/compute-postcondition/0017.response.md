`s` is assigned the value `'G'` and concatenated to the existing value of `s`. The length of `s` increases by 1. The conditions related to `c`, `k`, `n`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `c` is 0, `d` is the opposite of its original value, and `s` is the original `s` plus `'G'`.**
