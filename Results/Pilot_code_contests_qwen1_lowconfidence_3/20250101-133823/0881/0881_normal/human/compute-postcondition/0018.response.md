`a` is decremented by 1. The value of `k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `c` is 0, `d` is the opposite of its original value, and `s` is the original `s` plus `'G'`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `a`.

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `c` is 0, `d` is the opposite of its original value, and `s` is the original `s` plus `'G'`; `a` is `a - 1`.**
