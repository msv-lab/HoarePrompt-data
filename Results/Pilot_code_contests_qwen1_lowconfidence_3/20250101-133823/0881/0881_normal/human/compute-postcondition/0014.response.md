`c` is reassigned to 0, which means it no longer holds the value of `k`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `d` also remains unchanged in terms of its relationship to its original value (opposite). The initial state of `k` being the second element of `vals` and `n` being greater than or equal to `k` is preserved.

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `c` is 0, `d` is the opposite of its original value**
