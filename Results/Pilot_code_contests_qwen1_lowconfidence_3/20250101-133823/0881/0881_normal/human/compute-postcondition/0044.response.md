`d` is assigned the opposite of its original value, which means `d` changes from its current value to the opposite (True becomes False and False becomes True). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is 1, `d` is the opposite of its original value, and `s` is either the original `s` plus 'GG' or 'BG'; `a` is decreased by 1.**
