The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly from the given code snippet. However, based on the constraints provided, the function seems to operate within these constraints involving the variables `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Given the constraints:

- `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are integers.
- `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5`.
- `0 ≤ a, b ≤ n`.
- `a + b = n`.

Since no parameters are explicitly passed to the function, we need to infer the functionality based on these constraints alone.

Functionality: **The function operates with internal variables n, k, a, and b constrained such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n, and a + b = n, but does not accept any parameters and returns a value based on these constraints.**
