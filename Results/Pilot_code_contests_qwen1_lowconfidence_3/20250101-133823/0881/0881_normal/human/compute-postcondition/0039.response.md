The code sets `c` to 0. This updates the value of `c`. The values of the other variables (`k`, `n`, `d`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is 0, `d` is the opposite of its original value, and `s` is either the original `s` plus 'G' or 'B'**
