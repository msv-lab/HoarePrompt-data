`a` is decremented by 1. The value of `k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is 0, `d` is the opposite of its original value, and `s` is either the original `s` plus 'GG' or 'BG'. No other changes occur to the variables.

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is 0, `d` is the opposite of its original value, and `s` is either the original `s` plus 'GG' or 'BG'; `a` is decreased by 1.**
