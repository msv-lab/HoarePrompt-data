`d` is assigned the value `not d`. Since `d` is either the original value or its opposite depending on the condition `a < 0 or b < 0`, taking the `not` of `d` will flip its value. Therefore, the value of `d` will now be the opposite of what it was before. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is 0, `d` is the opposite of its original value, and `s` is either the original `s` plus 'G' or 'B'**
