`c` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `k` remains the second element of `vals`, `n` is still greater than 1, `d` retains its original value, `s` is still either the original `s` plus 'GB' or 'BB', and `b` is decreased by 1. 

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` is greater than 1, `c` is 0, `d` is the original value of `d`, `s` is either the original `s` plus 'GB' or 'BB', `b` is decreased by 1.**
