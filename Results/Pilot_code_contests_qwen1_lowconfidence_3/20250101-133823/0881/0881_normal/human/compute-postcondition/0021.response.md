The code `d = not d` changes the value of `d` to its logical opposite. Since `d` was previously the opposite of its original value, changing it again will make it equal to its original value. The other variables are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `c` is 1, `d` is the original value of `d`, and `s` is the original `s` plus 'G'.**
