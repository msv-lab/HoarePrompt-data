The code `vals = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `vals`. The initial conditions state that `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, `0 ≤ a, b ≤ n`, and `a + b = n`. After executing the code, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, but a new list `vals` is created containing the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a + b = n, `b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a + b = n, and `vals` is a list of integers equal to the input split and converted to integers.**
