`c` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `c` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is decreased by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `c` is 1, `d` remains unchanged, `s` is `'B'`.

Output State: **`b` is decreased by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `c` is 1, `d` remains unchanged, `s` is `'B'`**
