The code initializes `c` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, or `vals`. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^5\); `k` is the second element of `vals`; `a` is equal to `vals[2]`; `b` is the fourth element of `vals`; `vals` is a list of integers equal to the input split and converted to integers; `c` is 0.**
