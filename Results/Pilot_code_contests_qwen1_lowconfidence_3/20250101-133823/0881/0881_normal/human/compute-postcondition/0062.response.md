`a` is decreased by 1. Since `a` was originally decreased by 1 only if `d` is the opposite of its original value, and the condition for this decrease is not met (as no information suggests `d` has changed), `a` simply decreases by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is 0, `s` is now `s + 'G'`, `a` is `a - 1`, `b` is decreased by 1 otherwise, and `d` is the original value of `d`.**
