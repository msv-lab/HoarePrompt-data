The code `d = not d` flips the boolean value of `d`. However, the initial value of `d` is not specified in the initial state. Since the initial value of `d` is not given, we cannot determine the exact new value of `d` after the operation. But we can state that `d` is now the opposite of its original value.

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `n` must be within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), the value of `c` equals `k`, `d` is the opposite of its original value**
