The code assigns the value of `vals[3]` to `b`. Initially, `b` is equal to `vals[2]`, and now it is being updated to the value of `vals[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^5\), `k` is the second element of `vals`, `a` is equal to `vals[2]`, `b` is now the fourth element of `vals`, and `vals` is a list of integers equal to the input split and converted to integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^5\); `k` is the second element of `vals`; `a` is equal to `vals[2]`; `b` is the fourth element of `vals`; `vals` is a list of integers equal to the input split and converted to integers.**
