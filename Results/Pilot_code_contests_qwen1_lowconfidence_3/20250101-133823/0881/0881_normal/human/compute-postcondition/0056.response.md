Postcondition: ***`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is 0, and `s` is either the original `s` plus 'GG' or 'BG' or 'GB' or 'BB'. Depending on the value of `d`, `a` is decreased by 1 if `d` is the opposite of its original value, and `b` is decreased by 1 otherwise. If `a < 0` or `b < 0`, the console prints 'NO'.***
