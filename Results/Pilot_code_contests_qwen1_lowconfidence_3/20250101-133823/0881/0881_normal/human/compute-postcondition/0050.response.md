The code snippet changes the value of `d` to its opposite. Given the initial state, the only thing that changes is the value of `d`. Since `d` was the opposite of its original value before the code, after executing `d = not d`, `d` will now be the original value of `d`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is 1, `d` is the original value of `d`, and `s` is either the original `s` plus 'GB' or 'BB'; `b` is decreased by 1.**
