`c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` was 0, so now `c` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is 1, `s` is now `s + 'G'`, `a` is `a - 1`, `b` is decreased by 1 otherwise, and `d` is the original value of `d`.**
