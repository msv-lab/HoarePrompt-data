`d` is assigned the value of `not d`. This means if `d` was originally `True`, it will become `False`, and vice versa. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is 2, `s` is `s` plus 'B', `a` is decreased by 1 if `d` is the opposite of its original value, `b` is decreased by 1, and `d` is the opposite of its original value.**
