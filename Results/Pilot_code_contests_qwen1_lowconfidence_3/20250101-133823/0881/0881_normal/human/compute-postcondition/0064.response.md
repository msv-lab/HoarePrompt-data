The code `d = not d` changes the value of `d` to the opposite of its current value. Since the initial state does not specify the exact boolean value of `d`, it could be either `True` or `False`. Flipping the value of `d` in both cases will give us the updated value.

Given the initial state:
- `k` is the second element of `vals`
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `c` is 1
- `s` is now `s + 'G'`
- `a` is `a - 1`
- `b` is decreased by 1 otherwise (implying it's already decreased)
- `d` is the original value of `d`

After executing `d = not d`:
- `d` becomes the opposite of its original value, so if `d` was `True`, it becomes `False`, and vice versa.

The output state remains as follows:
- `k` is the second element of `vals`
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `c` is 1
- `s` is now `s + 'G'`
- `a` is `a - 1`
- `b` is decreased by 1 otherwise
- `d` is the opposite of its original value

Since the exact value of `d` is not specified initially, we represent it as the opposite of its original value.

Output State: **`k` is the second element of `vals`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is 1, `s` is now `s + 'G'`, `a` is `a - 1`, `b` is decreased by 1 otherwise, `d` is the opposite of its original value**.
