Postcondition: ***`k` is the second element of `vals`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is 0, `s` is either `s + 'G'` or `s + 'B'` depending on the value of `d`, `a` and `b` are each decreased by 1, and `d` is the opposite of its original value. If `a < 0` or `b < 0`, the console prints 'NO'.***
