You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innokentiy likes tea very much and today he wants to drink exactly n cups of tea. He would be happy to drink more but he had exactly n tea bags, a of them are green and b are black.

Innokentiy doesn't like to drink the same tea (green or black) more than k times in a row. Your task is to determine the order of brewing tea bags so that Innokentiy will be able to drink n cups of tea, without drinking the same tea more than k times in a row, or to inform that it is impossible. Each tea bag has to be used exactly once.

Input

The first line contains four integers n, k, a and b (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n) — the number of cups of tea Innokentiy wants to drink, the maximum number of cups of same tea he can drink in a row, the number of tea bags of green and black tea. It is guaranteed that a + b = n.

Output

If it is impossible to drink n cups of tea, print "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, print the string of the length n, which consists of characters 'G' and 'B'. If some character equals 'G', then the corresponding cup of tea should be green. If some character equals 'B', then the corresponding cup of tea should be black.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

    n = vals[0]
    k = vals[1]
    a = vals[2]
    b = vals[3]
    c = 0
    d = True
    if b > a:
        d = False
    s = ''
    for i in range(n):
        if c == k:
            d = not d
            c = 0
        if d:
            s += 'G'
            a -= 1
            c += 1
            if a < b:
                d = not d
                c = 0
        else:
            s += 'B'
            b -= 1
            c += 1
            if b < a:
                d = not d
                c = 0
        if a < 0 or b < 0:
            print('NO')
            quit()
    print(s)

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the number of green tea bags (a) is greater than the number of black tea bags (b). In such a scenario, it is impossible to brew a sequence where the same type of tea is not repeated more than k times in a row. However, the program does not check this condition before attempting to construct the sequence. For example, consider the input:

```
5 1 2 3
```

The program will attempt to construct a sequence but will fail because there are more black tea bags than green tea bags, and k=1, meaning no two consecutive cups can be the same. The program does not account for this possibility and will incorrectly output a sequence without checking the feasibility of the task. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` according to specific constraints and generates a string `s` consisting of 'G' and 'B' characters. The string `s` is constructed based on the values of `a` and `b` within a loop that runs `n` times. If at any point during the loop, `a` or `b` becomes negative, the function immediately prints 'NO' and exits. After completing the loop, the function prints the generated string `s`. If no negative values occur, `s` will consist of exactly `k` 'G' characters and the rest will be 'B' characters, with the pattern alternating between 'G' and 'B' based on the values of `a` and `b`. The function handles the case where `b > a` by setting `d` to `False` initially, ensuring the pattern alternates correctly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
