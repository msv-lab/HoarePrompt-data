The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `xs`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and `k`, which is an integer. The list `xs` has a length between 1 and 10^5, inclusive, and each integer in the list is between 0 and 10^9, inclusive.

The function checks the relative order of adjacent elements in the list `xs` and performs specific actions based on certain conditions:
1. It counts the number of times an element is greater than its next element (`k1`) and the number of times an element is smaller than its next element (`k2`).
2. If `k2` is at least 2, it searches for pairs of elements that are in ascending order and prints their indices plus `k` before exiting.
3. If `k2` is 1 and `k1` is at least 1 and the length of `xs` is less than `n`, it searches for pairs of elements that are in descending order and prints their indices plus `k` before exiting.
4. If `k2` is 1 and `k1` is 0 and the length of `xs` is at least 3, it searches for elements that are smaller than their next element and prints their indices plus `k` before exiting.
5. If `k2` is 0, it checks if the first element of `xs` is different from the last element and prints '1 1' plus `k` if they are different before exiting.

If none of the above conditions are met, the function does not print anything and exits without making changes to `k1` and `k2`.

The function does not return anything; instead, it either prints indices and exits or exits without printing anything. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `k1` and `k2` have been updated according to the conditions checked, and the program either prints indices and exits or exits without printing anything.
