The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `t` and an optional lambda function `f`. It reads `t` lines from an input source, splits each line into non-negative integers, and optionally applies the lambda function `f` to each integer in the split lines. The function then returns a list where each element is either a list of non-negative integers or a tuple of transformed non-negative integers, based on whether `f` is provided or not. The list is formed after calling `read()` exactly `t` times. If `f` is not provided, the elements in the list are lists of non-negative integers; otherwise, they are tuples containing the transformed integers. The function handles the case where `f` is provided and applies it to each integer in the split lines.
