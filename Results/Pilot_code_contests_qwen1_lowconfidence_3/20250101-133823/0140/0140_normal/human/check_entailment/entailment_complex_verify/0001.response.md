Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code and the problem description indicate that the program does not correctly handle the case where the array is already sorted in a way that no two distinct elements can be swapped to make it unsorted. Specifically, the program does not check if the array is already fully sorted in either ascending or descending order. 

For example, consider the input `[4, 4, 4, 4]`. The program should output `-1` because no two distinct elements can be swapped to make the array unsorted. However, the current implementation does not perform this check properly, leading to incorrect behavior. 

The modified version of the `func_3` function, which includes the necessary check, ensures that the program behaves correctly in this scenario. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is not correct based on the problem description.
