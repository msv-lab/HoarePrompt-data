You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Petya likes arrays of integers a lot. Recently his mother has presented him one such array consisting of n elements. Petya is now wondering whether he can swap any two distinct integers in the array so that the array got unsorted. Please note that Petya can not swap equal integers even if they are in distinct positions in the array. Also note that Petya must swap some two integers even if the original array meets all requirements.

Array a (the array elements are indexed from 1) consisting of n elements is called sorted if it meets at least one of the following two conditions:

  1. a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ an; 
  2. a1 ≥ a2 ≥ ... ≥ an. 



Help Petya find the two required positions to swap or else say that they do not exist.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The second line contains n non-negative space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an — the elements of the array that Petya's mother presented him. All integers in the input do not exceed 109.

Output

If there is a pair of positions that make the array unsorted if swapped, then print the numbers of these positions separated by a space. If there are several pairs of positions, print any of them. If such pair does not exist, print -1. The positions in the array are numbered with integers from 1 to n.

Examples

Input

1
1


Output

-1


Input

2
1 2


Output

-1


Input

4
1 2 3 4


Output

1 2


Input

3
1 1 1


Output

-1

Note

In the first two samples the required pairs obviously don't exist.

In the third sample you can swap the first two elements. After that the array will look like this: 2 1 3 4. This array is unsorted.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array is already sorted in a way that no two distinct elements can be swapped to make it unsorted. Specifically, consider the input `4 4 4 4`. The program should output `-1` because no two distinct elements can be swapped to make the array unsorted. However, the current implementation does not check this condition properly.

To fix this, we need to add a check at the beginning of the function to see if the array is sorted in either ascending or descending order and has more than one element. If it does, the program should output `-1`. Here is a modified version of the `func_3` function to include this check:

```python
def func_3(xs, k):
    # Check if the array is already sorted in ascending or descending order
    if xs == sorted(xs) or xs == sorted(xs, reverse=True):
        if len(xs) > 1:
            w('-1')
            sys.exit()
    
    k2 = 0
    k1 = 0
    for i in range(len(xs) - 1):
        if xs[i] < xs[i + 1]:
            k2 += 1
        if xs[i] > xs[i + 1]:
            k1 += 1
    
    if k2 >= 2:
        for i in range(len(xs) - 1):
            if xs[i] < xs[i + 1]:
                w('%s %s' % (i + 1, i + 2))
                sys.exit()
    
    if k2 == 1 and k1 >= 1:
        for i in range(len(xs) - 1):
            if xs[i] > xs[i + 1]:
                w('%s %s' % (i + 1, i + 2))
                sys.exit()
    
    if k2 == 1 and k1 == 0 and len(xs) >= 3:
        for i in range(len(xs) - 1):
            if xs[i] < xs[i + 1]:
                w('%s %s' % (i + 1, i + 2))
                sys.exit()
    
    if k2 == 0:
        for i in range(len(xs) - 1):
            if xs[0] != xs[i]:
                w('%s %s' % (1, i + 1))
                sys.exit()
```

With this modification, the program will correctly handle the case where the array is already fully sorted, ensuring it outputs `-1` when no valid swap exists.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys
import math
from collections import deque

w = sys.stdout.write
read = sys.stdin.readline
reads = sys.stdin.read
sqrt = math.sqrt
[n] = func_1(int)
xs = func_1(int)
xss = set(xs)
if n <= 2:
    w('-1')
    sys.exit()
if len(xss) == 1:
    w('-1')
    sys.exit()
if len(xs) == 3 and xs[0] == xs[2]:
    w('-1')
    sys.exit()
func_3(xs, 0)
xs.reverse()
func_3(xs, -1 * n)
w('-1')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: read is a function that reads a line from input and returns a string, and the array elements are space-separated integers where the number of elements n is the first integer read and the subsequent elements are the integers in the array.
def func_1(f):
    if f :
        return map(f, read().split())
        #`The program returns a map object containing the results of applying function f to each element in the array of integers`
    else :
        return read().split()
        #The program returns a list of strings, which are the space-separated integers read from the input, excluding the first integer (the count of elements)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `f`, which can be a function or `None`. If `f` is a function, it applies `f` to each element in the array of integers (after reading the array from input). If `f` is `None`, it simply returns a list of strings, which are the space-separated integers read from the input, excluding the first integer (the count of elements).

The final state of the program after the function concludes will be as follows:
- If `f` is a function, the program returns a map object containing the results of applying `f` to each element in the array of integers.
- If `f` is `None`, the program returns a list of strings representing the space-separated integers read from the input, excluding the first integer (the count of elements).

This covers all potential cases and includes the necessary logic based on the provided code and annotations.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of lines to read, and each line contains n non-negative integers separated by spaces. The integers are not greater than 10^9. The function f is optional and can be a lambda function applied to each element in the split strings.
def func_2(t, f):
    result = []
    result_append = result.append
    for i in xrange(t):
        if f:
            result_append(tuple(map(f, read().split())))
        else:
            result_append(list(read().split()))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is `t`, `result` is a list where each element is either a list of non-negative integers or a tuple of transformed non-negative integers (based on the function `f`), depending on whether `f` is `True` or `False`, and `read()` is called `t` times.
    return result
    #`The program returns a list 'result' where each element is either a list of non-negative integers or a tuple of transformed non-negative integers, based on the value of 'f', and this list is formed after calling 'read()' exactly 't' times`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `t` and an optional lambda function `f`. It reads `t` lines from an input source, splits each line into non-negative integers, and optionally applies the lambda function `f` to each integer in the split lines. The function then returns a list where each element is either a list of non-negative integers or a tuple of transformed non-negative integers, based on whether `f` is provided or not. The list is formed after calling `read()` exactly `t` times. If `f` is not provided, the elements in the list are lists of non-negative integers; otherwise, they are tuples containing the transformed integers. The function handles the case where `f` is provided and applies it to each integer in the split lines.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`k1` and `k2` are integers representing the counts of indices where elements are out of order in the list `xs`.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`k1` and `k2` are integers representing the counts of indices where elements are out of order in the list `xs`. If `k2 == 0`, then either the first element of `xs` is not equal to the `(n-1)`-th element of `xs`, in which case '1 1' is printed, or no specific action is taken. Otherwise, `k1` and `k2` remain unchanged as they were initially (both are 0 and 1 respectively).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `xs`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and `k`, which is an integer. The list `xs` has a length between 1 and 10^5, inclusive, and each integer in the list is between 0 and 10^9, inclusive.

The function checks the relative order of adjacent elements in the list `xs` and performs specific actions based on certain conditions:
1. It counts the number of times an element is greater than its next element (`k1`) and the number of times an element is smaller than its next element (`k2`).
2. If `k2` is at least 2, it searches for pairs of elements that are in ascending order and prints their indices plus `k` before exiting.
3. If `k2` is 1 and `k1` is at least 1 and the length of `xs` is less than `n`, it searches for pairs of elements that are in descending order and prints their indices plus `k` before exiting.
4. If `k2` is 1 and `k1` is 0 and the length of `xs` is at least 3, it searches for elements that are smaller than their next element and prints their indices plus `k` before exiting.
5. If `k2` is 0, it checks if the first element of `xs` is different from the last element and prints '1 1' plus `k` if they are different before exiting.

If none of the above conditions are met, the function does not print anything and exits without making changes to `k1` and `k2`.

The function does not return anything; instead, it either prints indices and exits or exits without printing anything. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `k1` and `k2` have been updated according to the conditions checked, and the program either prints indices and exits or exits without printing anything.
