Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array is already sorted in a way that no two distinct elements can be swapped to make it unsorted. Specifically, consider the input `4 4 4 4`. The program should output `-1` because no two distinct elements can be swapped to make the array unsorted. However, the current implementation does not check this condition properly.

To fix this, we need to add a check at the beginning of the function to see if the array is sorted in either ascending or descending order and has more than one element. If it does, the program should output `-1`. Here is a modified version of the `func_3` function to include this check:

```python
def func_3(xs, k):
    # Check if the array is already sorted in ascending or descending order
    if xs == sorted(xs) or xs == sorted(xs, reverse=True):
        if len(xs) > 1:
            w('-1')
            sys.exit()
    
    k2 = 0
    k1 = 0
    for i in range(len(xs) - 1):
        if xs[i] < xs[i + 1]:
            k2 += 1
        if xs[i] > xs[i + 1]:
            k1 += 1
    
    if k2 >= 2:
        for i in range(len(xs) - 1):
            if xs[i] < xs[i + 1]:
                w('%s %s' % (i + 1, i + 2))
                sys.exit()
    
    if k2 == 1 and k1 >= 1:
        for i in range(len(xs) - 1):
            if xs[i] > xs[i + 1]:
                w('%s %s' % (i + 1, i + 2))
                sys.exit()
    
    if k2 == 1 and k1 == 0 and len(xs) >= 3:
        for i in range(len(xs) - 1):
            if xs[i] < xs[i + 1]:
                w('%s %s' % (i + 1, i + 2))
                sys.exit()
    
    if k2 == 0:
        for i in range(len(xs) - 1):
            if xs[0] != xs[i]:
                w('%s %s' % (1, i + 1))
                sys.exit()
```

With this modification, the program will correctly handle the case where the array is already fully sorted, ensuring it outputs `-1` when no valid swap exists.
