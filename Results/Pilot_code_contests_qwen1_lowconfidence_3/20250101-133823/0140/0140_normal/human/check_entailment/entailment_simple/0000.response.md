Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given annotated program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Function Definitions and Usage**:
   - Functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are defined and used in the code, but their definitions are incomplete and inconsistent with the expected behavior.
   - `func_1` is meant to read the number of elements and the array elements from input, but its implementation does not match the expected behavior. It should directly return a list of integers, not a map object.
   - `func_2` is not used in the main logic, and its implementation seems to read multiple lines of input, which is not necessary for this problem.
   - `func_3` is intended to check the sorted condition and find the indices to swap, but its implementation does not align with the problem requirements.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic does not correctly identify whether swapping any two distinct integers can make the array unsorted.
   - The conditions for checking if the array is already sorted (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing) and finding indices to swap are missing or incorrectly implemented.
   - The program assumes certain conditions (like the existence of at least two different elements) without checking them properly.
   - The program does not handle all edge cases as specified in the problem description, such as arrays with all elements being the same or having only three elements where the middle element is the same as the first and last.

3. **Specific Issues**:
   - The program does not correctly identify the indices to swap to make the array unsorted.
   - The logic to check if the array is already sorted and needs a swap is flawed.
   - The program does not handle the case where the array can be made unsorted by swapping two distinct integers but incorrectly prints `-1`.

To fix these issues, the program needs to:
- Read the input correctly using `func_1`.
- Check if the array is already sorted in both increasing and decreasing orders.
- Identify and print the indices of two distinct integers that can be swapped to make the array unsorted.

Here is a corrected version of the main logic based on the problem description:

```python
[n] = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
xs = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

# Check if the array is already sorted in increasing or decreasing order
increasing = True
decreasing = True
for i in range(n - 1):
    if xs[i] > xs[i + 1]:
        increasing = False
    if xs[i] < xs[i + 1]:
        decreasing = False

if increasing or decreasing:
    print(-1)
else:
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if xs[i] != xs[i + 1]:
            print(i + 1, i + 2)
            break
```

This corrected version correctly identifies whether the array can be made unsorted by swapping two distinct integers and prints the indices accordingly.
