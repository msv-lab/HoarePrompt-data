You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Little Petya likes arrays of integers a lot. Recently his mother has presented him one such array consisting of n elements. Petya is now wondering whether he can swap any two distinct integers in the array so that the array got unsorted. Please note that Petya can not swap equal integers even if they are in distinct positions in the array. Also note that Petya must swap some two integers even if the original array meets all requirements.

Array a (the array elements are indexed from 1) consisting of n elements is called sorted if it meets at least one of the following two conditions:

  1. a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ an; 
  2. a1 ≥ a2 ≥ ... ≥ an. 



Help Petya find the two required positions to swap or else say that they do not exist.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The second line contains n non-negative space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an — the elements of the array that Petya's mother presented him. All integers in the input do not exceed 109.

Output

If there is a pair of positions that make the array unsorted if swapped, then print the numbers of these positions separated by a space. If there are several pairs of positions, print any of them. If such pair does not exist, print -1. The positions in the array are numbered with integers from 1 to n.

Examples

Input

1
1


Output

-1


Input

2
1 2


Output

-1


Input

4
1 2 3 4


Output

1 2


Input

3
1 1 1


Output

-1

Note

In the first two samples the required pairs obviously don't exist.

In the third sample you can swap the first two elements. After that the array will look like this: 2 1 3 4. This array is unsorted.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys
import math
from collections import deque

w = sys.stdout.write
read = sys.stdin.readline
reads = sys.stdin.read
sqrt = math.sqrt
[n] = func_1(int)
xs = func_1(int)
xss = set(xs)
if n <= 2:
    w('-1')
    sys.exit()
if len(xss) == 1:
    w('-1')
    sys.exit()
if len(xs) == 3 and xs[0] == xs[2]:
    w('-1')
    sys.exit()
func_3(xs, 0)
xs.reverse()
func_3(xs, -1 * n)
w('-1')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: read is a function that reads a line from input and returns a string, and the array elements are space-separated integers where the number of elements n is the first integer read and the subsequent elements are the integers in the array.
def func_1(f):
    if f :
        return map(f, read().split())
        #`The program returns a map object containing the results of applying function f to each element in the array of integers`
    else :
        return read().split()
        #The program returns a list of strings, which are the space-separated integers read from the input, excluding the first integer (the count of elements)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of lines to read, and each line contains n non-negative integers separated by spaces. The integers are not greater than 10^9. The function f is optional and can be a lambda function applied to each element in the split strings.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
