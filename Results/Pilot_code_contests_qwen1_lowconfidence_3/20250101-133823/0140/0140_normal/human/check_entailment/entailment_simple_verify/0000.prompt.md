You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Petya likes arrays of integers a lot. Recently his mother has presented him one such array consisting of n elements. Petya is now wondering whether he can swap any two distinct integers in the array so that the array got unsorted. Please note that Petya can not swap equal integers even if they are in distinct positions in the array. Also note that Petya must swap some two integers even if the original array meets all requirements.

Array a (the array elements are indexed from 1) consisting of n elements is called sorted if it meets at least one of the following two conditions:

  1. a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ an; 
  2. a1 ≥ a2 ≥ ... ≥ an. 



Help Petya find the two required positions to swap or else say that they do not exist.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The second line contains n non-negative space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an — the elements of the array that Petya's mother presented him. All integers in the input do not exceed 109.

Output

If there is a pair of positions that make the array unsorted if swapped, then print the numbers of these positions separated by a space. If there are several pairs of positions, print any of them. If such pair does not exist, print -1. The positions in the array are numbered with integers from 1 to n.

Examples

Input

1
1


Output

-1


Input

2
1 2


Output

-1


Input

4
1 2 3 4


Output

1 2


Input

3
1 1 1


Output

-1

Note

In the first two samples the required pairs obviously don't exist.

In the third sample you can swap the first two elements. After that the array will look like this: 2 1 3 4. This array is unsorted.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to check for certain conditions that could result in the array being unsorted after a swap. Here’s an analysis of the issues:

1. **Missing Edge Cases**: The program does not consider all possible scenarios where swapping two distinct integers can make the array unsorted. For example, it does not handle cases where the array is nearly sorted but requires a single swap to become unsorted.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The current implementation of `func_3` only checks for increasing sequences (`k2`) and decreasing sequences (`k1`). It does not fully cover the logic needed to determine if a swap can make the array unsorted.

Let’s take a specific example to illustrate the failure:

Consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. According to the problem, we need to check if there is a way to swap two distinct elements to make the array unsorted. In this case, the array is already sorted in ascending order, and no swap can make it unsorted without violating the condition of swapping distinct integers.

However, the program incorrectly identifies this as needing a swap, which is incorrect. The program does not properly handle the scenario where the array is already in a state where no valid swap exists to make it unsorted.

Here is a corrected version of the function that handles all necessary conditions:

```python
def func_3(xs):
    n = len(xs)
    if n <= 1:
        return -1
    
    # Check if the array is already sorted in ascending or descending order
    if xs == sorted(xs) or xs == sorted(xs, reverse=True):
        return -1
    
    # Find the first position where the sequence breaks
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if (xs[i-1] < xs[i] and xs[i] > xs[i+1]) or (xs[i-1] > xs[i] and xs[i] < xs[i+1]):
            return f"{i} {i+1}"
    
    # If no such positions found, return -1
    return -1

# Example usage
n = 5
xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(func_3(xs))
```

This corrected function ensures that it correctly identifies whether a swap can make the array unsorted by checking for both increasing and decreasing sequences and identifying the first position where the sequence breaks.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
