Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the array is already sorted in a way that swapping any two distinct integers would not make it unsorted. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
4
1 2 3 4
```

According to the problem description, the output should be `1 2` because swapping the first two elements would make the array unsorted. However, the provided code does not handle this case correctly. The function `func_3` checks for specific conditions but does not cover all possible scenarios where swapping any two distinct integers would make the array unsorted. 

In the given code, the condition `k2 >= 2` is used to check for at least two increasing pairs, which is one way to ensure the array can be made unsorted by swapping. However, it does not cover other scenarios where swapping two distinct integers can break the sorting order. For instance, in the input `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the function does not identify that swapping the first two elements would make the array unsorted.

To fix this, the code needs to be more comprehensive in checking all possible ways to make the array unsorted by swapping two distinct integers.
