Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not handle the case where the array is already fully sorted in either ascending or descending order and has more than one element. According to the problem description and the output hints, the program should output `-1` in such cases. However, the current implementation does not include this check. The modification suggested in the original assessment ensures that the program correctly handles this edge case, making the original assessment accurate.
