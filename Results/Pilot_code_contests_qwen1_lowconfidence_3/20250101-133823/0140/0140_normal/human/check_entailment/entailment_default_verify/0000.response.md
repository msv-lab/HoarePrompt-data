Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not correctly handle all scenarios as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code fails to identify cases where a single swap can make the array unsorted, especially when the array is nearly sorted. The output hints further clarify that the function `func_3` does not fully cover the necessary conditions to determine if a swap can make the array unsorted. For example, it does not properly handle cases where the array is nearly sorted but requires a single swap to become unsorted. The refined assessment confirms that the original assessment is correct due to the lack of comprehensive checks in the current implementation.
