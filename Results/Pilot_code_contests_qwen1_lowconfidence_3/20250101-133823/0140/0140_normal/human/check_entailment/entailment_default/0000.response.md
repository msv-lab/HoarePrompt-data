Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic to find two positions that, when swapped, would make the array unsorted. Here are a few cases where the code fails:

1. **Single Element Array**: The code does not handle the case where the array has only one element. According to the problem description, the function should return `-1` in this case. However, the code does not explicitly handle this scenario.

2. **Already Sorted Array**: The code checks for specific conditions that indicate the array is already sorted (either in ascending or descending order) and prints `-1` if these conditions are met. However, the code does not ensure that the array has at least one pair of elements that, when swapped, would make the array unsorted. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3]`, swapping any two elements would still keep the array sorted. The code should check for such scenarios and ensure that the array becomes unsorted after the swap.

3. **Specific Conditions Not Covered**: The code does not cover all possible cases that could make the array unsorted after a swap. For instance, it does not consider arrays where the elements are not all the same but still do not meet the criteria for being sorted. For example, an array like `[1, 3, 2]` is unsorted and could be made sorted by swapping `1` and `2`.

Given these issues, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
