The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `f`, which can be a function or `None`. If `f` is a function, it applies `f` to each element in the array of integers (after reading the array from input). If `f` is `None`, it simply returns a list of strings, which are the space-separated integers read from the input, excluding the first integer (the count of elements).

The final state of the program after the function concludes will be as follows:
- If `f` is a function, the program returns a map object containing the results of applying `f` to each element in the array of integers.
- If `f` is `None`, the program returns a list of strings representing the space-separated integers read from the input, excluding the first integer (the count of elements).

This covers all potential cases and includes the necessary logic based on the provided code and annotations.
