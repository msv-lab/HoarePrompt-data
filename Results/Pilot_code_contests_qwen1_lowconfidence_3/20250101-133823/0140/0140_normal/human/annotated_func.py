#State of the program right berfore the function call: read is a function that reads a line from input and returns a string, and the array elements are space-separated integers where the number of elements n is the first integer read and the subsequent elements are the integers in the array.
def func_1(f):
    if f :
        return map(f, read().split())
        #`The program returns a map object containing the results of applying function f to each element in the array of integers`
    else :
        return read().split()
        #The program returns a list of strings, which are the space-separated integers read from the input, excluding the first integer (the count of elements)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `f`, which can be a function or `None`. If `f` is a function, it applies `f` to each element in the array of integers (after reading the array from input). If `f` is `None`, it simply returns a list of strings, which are the space-separated integers read from the input, excluding the first integer (the count of elements).

The final state of the program after the function concludes will be as follows:
- If `f` is a function, the program returns a map object containing the results of applying `f` to each element in the array of integers.
- If `f` is `None`, the program returns a list of strings representing the space-separated integers read from the input, excluding the first integer (the count of elements).

This covers all potential cases and includes the necessary logic based on the provided code and annotations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of lines to read, and each line contains n non-negative integers separated by spaces. The integers are not greater than 10^9. The function f is optional and can be a lambda function applied to each element in the split strings.
def func_2(t, f):
    result = []
    result_append = result.append
    for i in xrange(t):
        if f:
            result_append(tuple(map(f, read().split())))
        else:
            result_append(list(read().split()))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is `t`, `result` is a list where each element is either a list of non-negative integers or a tuple of transformed non-negative integers (based on the function `f`), depending on whether `f` is `True` or `False`, and `read()` is called `t` times.
    return result
    #`The program returns a list 'result' where each element is either a list of non-negative integers or a tuple of transformed non-negative integers, based on the value of 'f', and this list is formed after calling 'read()' exactly 't' times`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `t` and an optional lambda function `f`. It reads `t` lines from an input source, splits each line into non-negative integers, and optionally applies the lambda function `f` to each integer in the split lines. The function then returns a list where each element is either a list of non-negative integers or a tuple of transformed non-negative integers, based on whether `f` is provided or not. The list is formed after calling `read()` exactly `t` times. If `f` is not provided, the elements in the list are lists of non-negative integers; otherwise, they are tuples containing the transformed integers. The function handles the case where `f` is provided and applies it to each integer in the split lines.

Otherwise, `k1` and `k2` remain unchanged as they were initially (both are 0 and 1 respectively).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `xs`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and `k`, which is an integer. The list `xs` has a length between 1 and 10^5, inclusive, and each integer in the list is between 0 and 10^9, inclusive.

The function checks the relative order of adjacent elements in the list `xs` and performs specific actions based on certain conditions:
1. It counts the number of times an element is greater than its next element (`k1`) and the number of times an element is smaller than its next element (`k2`).
2. If `k2` is at least 2, it searches for pairs of elements that are in ascending order and prints their indices plus `k` before exiting.
3. If `k2` is 1 and `k1` is at least 1 and the length of `xs` is less than `n`, it searches for pairs of elements that are in descending order and prints their indices plus `k` before exiting.
4. If `k2` is 1 and `k1` is 0 and the length of `xs` is at least 3, it searches for elements that are smaller than their next element and prints their indices plus `k` before exiting.
5. If `k2` is 0, it checks if the first element of `xs` is different from the last element and prints '1 1' plus `k` if they are different before exiting.

If none of the above conditions are met, the function does not print anything and exits without making changes to `k1` and `k2`.

The function does not return anything; instead, it either prints indices and exits or exits without printing anything. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `k1` and `k2` have been updated according to the conditions checked, and the program either prints indices and exits or exits without printing anything.
