The code `sys.exit()` causes the program to exit immediately without further execution. Since the program exits, no further operations are performed, and the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `k2` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 1, `xs` is a list of elements**
