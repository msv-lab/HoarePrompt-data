`k1` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `k1` is an integer. The other variables (`k2`, `xs`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k1` is an integer + 1, `k2` is incremented by 1, `xs` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, and `i` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`k1` is an integer + 1, `k2` is incremented by 1, `xs` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
