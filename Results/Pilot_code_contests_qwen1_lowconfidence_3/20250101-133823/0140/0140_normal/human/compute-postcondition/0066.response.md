The code `sys.exit()` causes the program to exit immediately without further execution of any subsequent code. Since the program exits, none of the variables will be updated or affected by the remaining code. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`k1` is 0, `k2` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of `xs` (at least 3), the current value of `xs[i]` is less than `xs[i + 1]`**
