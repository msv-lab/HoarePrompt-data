The code `w('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k1), abs(i + 2 + k2)))` prints the absolute values of `i + 1 + k1` and `i + 2 + k2`. Given the initial state:

- `k1` is 0
- `k2` is 1
- `i` is 0
- `n` is the length of `xs` (at least 3)
- The current value of `xs[i]` is less than `xs[i + 1]`

Let's calculate the values:

- `abs(i + 1 + k1)` = `abs(0 + 1 + 0)` = `abs(1)` = 1
- `abs(i + 2 + k2)` = `abs(0 + 2 + 1)` = `abs(3)` = 3

Therefore, the code prints "1 3". However, the print statement itself does not change the values of the variables.

Output State: **`k1` is 0, `k2` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of `xs` (at least 3), the current value of `xs[i]` is less than `xs[i + 1]`**
