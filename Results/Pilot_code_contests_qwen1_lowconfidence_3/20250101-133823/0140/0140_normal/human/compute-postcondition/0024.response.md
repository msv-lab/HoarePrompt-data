The `sys.exit()` function call causes the program to terminate immediately, which means no further code is executed, and no changes are made to any variables. All previously defined conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k2` is greater than or equal to 2, and the current value of `xs[i]` is less than the current value of `xs[i + 1]; printed values are `abs(i + 1 + k)` and `abs(i + 2 + k)`**
