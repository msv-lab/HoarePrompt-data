`i` is incremented by 1 and then 1 is added to the result, which gives `i + 2`. Since `i` is initially 0, `i + 2` is 2. Similarly, `i + 1` is 1. The absolute values of these expressions are taken, which are 1 and 2 respectively. These values are then concatenated with a space in between and passed to the function `w`. The function `w` does not return a value, but the values of `k1`, `k2`, `i`, `n`, and `xs` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `k2` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 1, `xs` is a list of elements, and the current value of `i` is 0. The first element of `xs` is less than the second element of `xs`; w was called with the argument '1 2'.**
