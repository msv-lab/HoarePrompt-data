`k1` is incremented by 1. The value of `k1` was initially 0, so it now becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k1` is 1, `k2` is 0, `xs` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`. The current value of `i` satisfies `0 <= i < n-1` and `xs[i] > xs[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`k1` is 1, `k2` is 0, `xs` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`. The current value of `i` satisfies `0 <= i < n-1` and `xs[i] > xs[i + 1]`.**
