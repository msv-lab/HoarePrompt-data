The code `sys.exit()` is used to terminate the program immediately, and no further code is executed after this point. Since the program exits, the values of `k1`, `k2`, `i`, `n`, and `xs` do not change, and the function call `w(abs(3 + k1) * abs(4 + k1))` is not processed. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`k1` is greater than or equal to 1; `k2` is 1; `i` is 2; `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 1; `xs` is a list of elements; the function `w` has been called with the argument `abs(3 + k1) * abs(4 + k1)`**
