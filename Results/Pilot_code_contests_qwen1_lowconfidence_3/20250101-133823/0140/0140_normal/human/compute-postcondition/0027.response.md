The code snippet uses `w('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k)))`, which calls a function `w` with a formatted string. The variables `i` and `k` are referenced in the string, but their values are not provided in the initial state, only `n` and `k2`. Since the values of `i` and `k` are not specified, they remain unchanged. The function `w` is called with two arguments, which are the absolute values of `i + 1 + k` and `i + 2 + k`.

Since the values of `i` and `k` are not given, we can express the output in terms of these variables. The initial state remains valid except for the fact that the function `w` is called with the specified arguments.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `k2` is greater than or equal to 2, `w` is called with arguments `abs(i + 1 + k)` and `abs(i + 2 + k)`**
