The code snippet `w('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k)))` uses the `abs` function to compute the absolute values of `(i + 1 + k)` and `(i + 2 + k)`. Given the initial state:

- `k1` is greater than or equal to 1
- `k2` is 1
- `i` is 1
- `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 1
- `xs` is a list of elements

We can substitute the values into the expressions:

1. For `abs(i + 1 + k)`, substituting `i = 1` gives `abs(1 + 1 + k) = abs(2 + k)`.
2. For `abs(i + 2 + k)`, substituting `i = 1` gives `abs(1 + 2 + k) = abs(3 + k)`.

Since `k` is not defined in the initial state, let's assume `k` is a variable that can take any value, but given the context, we know `k1` is at least 1 and `k2` is 1, which suggests `k` could be 1. However, for the purpose of the output state, we keep it general unless specified otherwise.

The code prints these absolute values using the `w` function, but does not assign them to any variables. Thus, the values themselves are not stored in variables but are printed.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variables, but we note that the values of `abs(2 + k)` and `abs(3 + k)` are printed.

Output State: **`k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `k2` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 1, `xs` is a list of elements, and `w` function is called with arguments `abs(2 + k)` and `abs(3 + k)`**.
