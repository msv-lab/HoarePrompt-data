The code uses the `w` function to print the formatted string `'abs(i + 1 + k) abs(i + 2 + k)'`. Given the initial state where `i` is `n-1`, `k2` is greater than or equal to 2, and `n` is at least 3, we can substitute these values into the string.

Let's break it down:
- `i` is `n-1`.
- Substitute `i` into the expressions: `abs(i + 1 + k)` and `abs(i + 2 + k)`.
- Since `k` is not defined in the snippet, we assume it's referring to `k2` from the initial state.

Thus, the expressions become:
- `abs((n-1) + 1 + k2) = abs(n + k2)`
- `abs((n-1) + 2 + k2) = abs(n + 1 + k2)`

Therefore, the output of the `w` function is `abs(n + k2) abs(n + 1 + k2)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `k2` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-1`, and the output is `abs(n + k2) abs(n + 1 + k2)`**.
