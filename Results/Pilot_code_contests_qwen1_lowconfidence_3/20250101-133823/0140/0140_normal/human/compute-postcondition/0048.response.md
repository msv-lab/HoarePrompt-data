The code `sys.exit()` is used to terminate the program immediately. Since the program exits without further execution, no changes are made to the variables. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `k2` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 1, `xs` is a list of elements, and `w` function is called with arguments `abs(2 + k1)` and `abs(3 + k1)` (assuming `k1` is passed as the argument to the `w` function). The program exits.**
