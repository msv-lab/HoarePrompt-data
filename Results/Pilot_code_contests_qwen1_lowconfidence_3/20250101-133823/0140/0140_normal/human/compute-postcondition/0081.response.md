The code snippet uses the `w` function to print a formatted string. The string to be printed is generated using the `abs` function, which computes the absolute value of its argument.

- The expression `1 + k1` evaluates to `1 + 0 = 1`.
- The expression `i + 1 + k1` evaluates to `0 + 1 + 0 = 1`.
- Both `1` and `1` are positive, so their absolute values are both `1`.

Therefore, the formatted string `'1 1'` is printed. No variables are changed by this code snippet, only a string is printed.

Output State: **`k1` is 0, `k2` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0 initially, the first element of `xs` is not equal to the `i`-th element of `xs`, and '1 1' is printed.**
