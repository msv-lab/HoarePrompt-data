The code `sys.exit()` is used to exit the program immediately. Since the program exits, no further operations can be performed, and all variables retain their previous states. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `k2` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 1, `xs` is a list of elements, and the printed string is '1 + k1 3'**
