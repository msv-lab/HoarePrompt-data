Postcondition: ***`k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `k2` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 1, `xs` is a list of elements. If `xs[i]` is less than `xs[i + 1]`, no action is taken. If `xs[i]` is not less than `xs[i + 1]`, the `w` function is called with arguments `abs(2 + k1)` and `abs(3 + k1)`.***
