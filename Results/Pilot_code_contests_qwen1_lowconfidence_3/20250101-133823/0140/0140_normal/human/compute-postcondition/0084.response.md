Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `k1` is 0
   - `k2` is 1
   - `n` is at least 1
   - `i` is 0
   - Either the first element of `xs` is not equal to the `i`-th element of `xs`, in which case '1 1' is printed, or the first element of `xs` equals the `i`-th element of `xs`, in which case no specific action is taken.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (since `xrange(0, n - 1)` generates values from 0 up to `n-2`).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 0.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be less than `n - 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented from 0 to 1.
   - Since `i` is now 1, the condition for the loop to continue (`i < n - 1`) must still hold true. Therefore, `n` must still be at least 1.
   - The value of `k1` and `k2` remains unchanged unless the loop body explicitly modifies them, but based on the given information, they do not change.
   - The first element of `xs` is compared to the `i`-th element of `xs` (which is now the second element of `xs`). No specific action is taken if they are equal, but if they are not equal, '1 1' is printed. This does not affect the loop continuation condition.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:
- `k1` is 0
- `k2` is 1
- `n` is at least 1
- `i` is 1

State: **`k1` is 0, `k2` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1**
