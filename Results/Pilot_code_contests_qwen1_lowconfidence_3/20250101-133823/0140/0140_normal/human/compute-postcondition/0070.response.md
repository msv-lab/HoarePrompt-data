The code `sys.exit()` is used to exit the program immediately, which means no further code execution will take place and all the variables remain in their current state. The states of the variables `k1`, `k2`, and `i` are not altered by this command.

Output State: **`k1` is 0, `k2` is 1, `i` is 2**
