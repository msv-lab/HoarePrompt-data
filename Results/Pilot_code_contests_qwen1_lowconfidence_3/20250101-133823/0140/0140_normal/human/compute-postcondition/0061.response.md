Postcondition: ***`k1` and `k2` represent the counts of indices where elements are out of order (greater or smaller) in the list `xs`. If `k2` is 1 and `k1` is at least 1 and the length of `xs` is less than `n`, the program either exits due to finding `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]` for some `i`, or exits without printing anything. Otherwise, no change is made to `k1` and `k2`.***
