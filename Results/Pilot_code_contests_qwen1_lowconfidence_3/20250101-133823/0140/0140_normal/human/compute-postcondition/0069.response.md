`i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. `k1` is 0, `k2` is 1, and `w('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k1), abs(i + 2 + k2)))` is executed. This prints the absolute values of `abs(2 + 1 + 0)` and `abs(2 + 2 + 1)`, which are `3` and `5` respectively. The values of `k1`, `k2`, and `i` are updated, but no assignment happens for these variables in the given code snippet. Therefore, their values remain unchanged except for `i`.

Output State: **`k1` is 0, `k2` is 1, `i` is 2**
