Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step by step.

### Initial State:
- `k1` is 0.
- `k2` is 1.
- `n` is the length of `xs` (at least 3).
- The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-2`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in xrange(0, n - 1, 1):
    if xs[i] < xs[i + 1]:
        w('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k)))
        sys.exit()
```

### Observations from Example Outputs:
- After 1 iteration, the loop exits because `xs[0] < xs[1]`.
- After 2 iterations, the loop exits because `xs[2] < xs[3]`.
- After 3 iterations, the loop exits because `xs[4] < xs[5]`.

From these observations, we can infer that:
- The loop will only exit if there is an element in the list `xs` that is less than the next element.
- The loop exits immediately when such a pair is found.

### Final Analysis:
- If the loop executes and finds any pair `xs[i] < xs[i+1]`, it will exit immediately and the values of `k1` and `k2` will remain unchanged.
- If the loop does not find any such pair, it means that the list `xs` is either completely non-decreasing or completely non-increasing, but since `k2` is initially set to 1, `k2` will always be 1 and `k1` will remain 0 unless the loop exits due to finding a decreasing pair.

### Conclusion:
- If the loop does not exit, the final state of the variables will be:
  - `k1` is 0.
  - `k2` is 1.
  - `i` will be `n - 1` because the loop would have iterated through the entire list without finding any decreasing pairs.
- If the loop exits, the values of `k1` and `k2` remain the same as in the initial state.

### Output State:
**Output State: `k1` is 0, `k2` is 1, `i` is `n - 1` if the loop does not exit, otherwise `k1` and `k2` are as they were initially (`k1` is 0, `k2` is 1).**
