The code snippet `w('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k1), abs(i + 2 + k2)))` prints the absolute values of `(i + 1 + k1)` and `(i + 2 + k2)`. Given the initial state:

- `k1` is greater than or equal to 1
- `k2` is 1
- `i` is 2
- `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 1
- `xs` is a list of elements

Let's calculate the values:

- `abs(i + 1 + k1)` becomes `abs(2 + 1 + k1) = abs(3 + k1)`. Since `k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `3 + k1` is greater than or equal to 4, so `abs(3 + k1) = 3 + k1`.
- `abs(i + 2 + k2)` becomes `abs(2 + 2 + 1) = abs(5) = 5`.

Thus, the output of `w` will be the string `'3 + k1 5'`.

Output State: **`k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `k2` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 1, `xs` is a list of elements, the function `w` has been called with the argument `'3 + k1 5'`**.
