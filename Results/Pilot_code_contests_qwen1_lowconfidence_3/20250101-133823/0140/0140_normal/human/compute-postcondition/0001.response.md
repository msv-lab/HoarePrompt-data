The code assigns the value 0 to the variable `k1`. The initial value of `k2` is 0, and the list `xs` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `k1` is 0, `k2` is 0, and `xs` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each integer in the list is between 0 and 10^9 inclusive.

Output State: **`k1` is 0, `k2` is 0, `xs` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each integer in the list is between 0 and 10^9 inclusive.**
