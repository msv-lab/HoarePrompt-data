Postcondition: ***`k1` and `k2` are integers representing the counts of indices where elements are out of order in the list `xs`. If `k2 == 0`, then either the first element of `xs` is not equal to the `(n-1)`-th element of `xs`, in which case '1 1' is printed, or no specific action is taken. Otherwise, `k1` and `k2` remain unchanged as they were initially (both are 0 and 1 respectively).***
