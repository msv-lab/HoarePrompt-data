The code `sys.exit()` is used to exit the program immediately, which means no further code will be executed. Therefore, none of the variables will be updated or assigned new values. The variables `k1`, `k2`, `n`, and `i` retain their initial states.

Output State: **`k1` is 0, `k2` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2**
