The code snippet uses the `w` function to print the formatted string `'%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k1), abs(i + 2 + k2))`. Given the initial state:

- `k1` is greater than or equal to 1
- `k2` is 1
- `xs` is a list of elements
- `i` is 0
- `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 1
- The current value of `xs[i]` is greater than `xs[i + 1]`

Let's calculate the values for the variables in the string:

- `abs(i + 1 + k1)` will be `abs(0 + 1 + k1) = abs(1 + k1)`. Since `k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `abs(1 + k1)` is `1 + k1`.
- `abs(i + 2 + k2)` will be `abs(0 + 2 + k2) = abs(2 + k2)`. Since `k2` is 1, `abs(2 + 1)` is `3`.

Thus, the printed string will be `'1 + k1 3'`. The variables `k1`, `k2`, `i`, `n`, and `xs` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `k2` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 1, `xs` is a list of elements, and the printed string is '1 + k1 3'**
