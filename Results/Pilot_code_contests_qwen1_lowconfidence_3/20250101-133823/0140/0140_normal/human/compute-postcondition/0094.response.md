The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `xs`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and `k`, which is an integer. The list `xs` has a length between 1 and 10^5, inclusive, and each integer in the list is between 0 and 10^9, inclusive. 

Case_1: If `k` is within the range of indices of `xs` (i.e., 0 â‰¤ k < len(xs)), the function returns the element at index `k` from the list `xs`.
Case_2: If `k` is not within the valid range of indices for `xs`, the function returns an error message indicating that the index is out of bounds.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a list `xs` of non-negative integers and an integer `k`, and if `k` is a valid index for `xs`, it returns the element at index `k`. If `k` is not a valid index, it returns an error message.
