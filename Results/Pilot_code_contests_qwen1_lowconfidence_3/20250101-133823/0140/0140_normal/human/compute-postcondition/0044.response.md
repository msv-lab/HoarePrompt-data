The code `sys.exit()` is used to exit the program immediately. This means that no further instructions in the current scope will be executed, and the program will terminate. Given this, the variables `k1`, `k2`, `i`, `n`, and `xs` will retain their initial values, and the function call `w("1 2")` will not be processed.

Output State: **`k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `k2` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 1, `xs` is a list of elements, and the program has exited.**
