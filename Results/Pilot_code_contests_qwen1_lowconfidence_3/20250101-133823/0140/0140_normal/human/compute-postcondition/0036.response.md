Postcondition: ***`k1` and `k2` represent the counts of indices where elements are out of order (greater or smaller) in the list `xs`. `k2` is 1 and `k1` is greater than or equal to 1. The length of `xss` is less than `n`. No change is made to `k1` and `k2` unless `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]` for some `i`, in which case the program exits.***
