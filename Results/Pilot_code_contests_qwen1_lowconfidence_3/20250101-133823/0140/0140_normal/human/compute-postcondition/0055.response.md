The code `sys.exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately without further execution of any subsequent code. This means that no new assignments or operations are performed on any of the existing variables. Therefore, the variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `k2` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 1, `xs` is a list of elements, the function `w` has been called with the argument `'3 + k1 5'`**
