`k1` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `k1` is an integer, and the exact value is not specified. The value of `i` is `i_val + 1`, and the condition for incrementing `k2` is not evaluated in this line of code. Therefore, the value of `k2` remains unchanged. The output state includes the updated value of `k1` and the unchanged values of `i` and `k2`.

Output State: **`k1` is an integer + 1, `i` is `i_val + 1`, `k2` is unchanged**
