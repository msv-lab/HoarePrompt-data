The code `sys.exit()` is used to exit the program immediately, which means no further operations will be performed. As a result, the values of the variables `n`, `k2`, and `i` remain unchanged. The output that was intended to be generated (`abs(n + k2) abs(n + 1 + k2)`) will not be produced because the program terminates before executing this line.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `k2` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-1`, and the program has exited.**
