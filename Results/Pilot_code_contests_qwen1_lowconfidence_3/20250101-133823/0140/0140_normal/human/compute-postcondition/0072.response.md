Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (inclusive).
   - The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 each time.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `k1` is 0
   - `k2` is 1
   - `i` is 2

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Given `i` is currently 2, the loop will continue if `n` is greater than 3.

4. **Update the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.
   - The other variables (`k1` and `k2`) remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and there is no modification to these variables mentioned.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `k1` is still 0
   - `k2` is still 1
   - `i` is now 3
   - `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`k1` is 0, `k2` is 1, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
