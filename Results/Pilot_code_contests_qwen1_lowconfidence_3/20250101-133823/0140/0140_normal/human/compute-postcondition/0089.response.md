The code `w('%s %s' % (abs(1 + k1), abs(i + 1 + k2)))` prints the absolute values of the expressions `1 + k1` and `i + 1 + k2`. 

- The initial value of `k1` is 0, so `abs(1 + k1)` becomes `abs(1 + 0)`, which is 1.
- The initial value of `i` is 2, and the initial value of `k2` is 1, so `abs(i + 1 + k2)` becomes `abs(2 + 1 + 1)`, which is `abs(4)`, and that is 4.

The function `w` is assumed to print the values, but since `w` is not defined in the given context, we assume it prints them directly. Thus, the output of the print statement is `1 4`.

The variables `k1`, `k2`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`k1` is 0, `k2` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2**
