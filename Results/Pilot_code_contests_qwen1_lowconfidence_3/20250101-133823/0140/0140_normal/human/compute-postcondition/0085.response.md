The code snippet uses the `w` function to print a formatted string using the `abs` function to get the absolute values of the expressions inside. Let's break it down:

1. `abs(1 + k1)` evaluates to `abs(1 + 0)`, which is `1`.
2. `abs(i + 1 + k2)` evaluates to `abs(1 + 1 + 1)`, which is `3`.

So, the string being printed is `'1 3'`. This string is printed, but it does not change the values of the variables `k1`, `k2`, `n`, and `i`.

Output State: **`k1` is 0, `k2` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1**
