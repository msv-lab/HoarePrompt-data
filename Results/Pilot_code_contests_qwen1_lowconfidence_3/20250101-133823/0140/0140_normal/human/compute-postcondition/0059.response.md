Postcondition: ***`k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `k2` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 1, `xs` is a list of elements, and the function `w` has been called with the argument `abs(3 + k1) * abs(4 + k1)`. If `xs[2] < xs[3]`, the postcondition remains the same. If `xs[2] >= xs[3]`, the postcondition also remains the same since there is no additional change specified in the else part.***
