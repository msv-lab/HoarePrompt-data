The code `sys.exit()` causes the program to exit immediately, and no further code is executed after this point. Therefore, none of the variables are updated or affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `k2` is greater than or equal to 2, `w` is called with arguments `abs(i + 1 + k)` and `abs(i + 2 + k)`**
