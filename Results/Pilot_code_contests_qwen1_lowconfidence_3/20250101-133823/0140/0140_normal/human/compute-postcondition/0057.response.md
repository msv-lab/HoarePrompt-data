The code snippet `w('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k1), abs(i + 2 + k1)))` impacts the following:
- It calls the function `w` with an argument that is a formatted string using `abs(i + 1 + k1)` and `abs(i + 2 + k1)`.
- The values of `i` and `k1` are used in the calculation of the arguments for the function `w`.

Given the initial state:
- `k1` is greater than or equal to 1
- `k2` is 1
- `i` is 2
- `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 1
- `xs` is a list of elements
- The function `w` has been called with the argument `'3 + k1 5'`

Let's calculate the new values:
- `abs(i + 1 + k1)` = `abs(2 + 1 + k1)` = `abs(3 + k1)`
- `abs(i + 2 + k1)` = `abs(2 + 2 + k1)` = `abs(4 + k1)`

So, the function `w` is called with the arguments `abs(3 + k1)` and `abs(4 + k1)`.

The states of `k2`, `i`, `n`, and `xs` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k1` is greater than or equal to 1; `k2` is 1; `i` is 2; `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 1; `xs` is a list of elements; the function `w` has been called with the argument `abs(3 + k1) abs(4 + k1)`**
