Postcondition: ***`k1` and `k2` represent the counts of indices where elements are out of order (greater or smaller) in the list `xs`. `k2` is 1, `k1` is 0, and the length of `xs` is at least 3. If `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]` is found for some `i`, the program will exit. Otherwise, no change is made to `k1` and `k2`***
