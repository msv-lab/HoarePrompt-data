Postcondition: ***`k1` and `k2` are integers representing the counts of indices where elements are out of order in the list `xs`. If the condition `k2 == 1 and k1 == 0 and len(xs) >= 3` is true, `k1` remains 0, `k2` remains 1, and `i` is set to `n - 1` if the loop does not exit. Otherwise, `k1` and `k2` remain unchanged as they were initially (both are 0 and 1 respectively).***
