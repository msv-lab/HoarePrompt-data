`k2` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `k2` is 0, so after executing the code, `k2` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`k1` is 0, `k2` is 1, `xs` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (where `n` must be at least 2), the current value of `i` is such that `0 <= i < n-1 and xs[i] < xs[i + 1]`**
