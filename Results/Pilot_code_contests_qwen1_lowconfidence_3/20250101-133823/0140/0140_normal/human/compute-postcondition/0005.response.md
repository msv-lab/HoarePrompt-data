Postcondition: **`k1` is 0, `k2` is 1, `xs` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (where `n` must be at least 2). If `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]`, then the current value of `i` satisfies `0 <= i < n-1` and `k2` is set to 1. Otherwise, the current value of `i` satisfies `0 <= i < n-1` and `k2` remains 0.**
