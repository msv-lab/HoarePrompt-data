The code `sys.exit()` is used to terminate the program immediately. This means that no further instructions in the current context will be executed, and the program will stop running. Since the program exits without further instructions, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k1` is 0, `k2` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, the first element of `xs` is not equal to the `i`-th element of `xs`, and '1 1' is printed.**
