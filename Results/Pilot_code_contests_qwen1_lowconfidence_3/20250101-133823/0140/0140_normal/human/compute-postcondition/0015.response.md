The code `k2 += 1` increments the value of `k2` by 1. The value of `i` is derived from `i_val + 1`, but since `i_val` is not given a specific value, we can only say that `i` is `i_val + 1`. The value of `k1` and the list `xs` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `k2`.

Output State: **`k1` is an integer, `i` is `i_val + 1`, `k2` is `k2 + 1`, `xs` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`**
