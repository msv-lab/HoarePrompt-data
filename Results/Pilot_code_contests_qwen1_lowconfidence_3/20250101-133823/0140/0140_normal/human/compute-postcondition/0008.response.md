Postcondition: ***`k1` and `k2` are integers, `xs` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`. The current value of `i` satisfies `0 <= i < n-1`. If `xs[i] > xs[i + 1]`, then `k1` is 1 and `k2` is 0. Otherwise, `k1` remains 0 and `k2` remains as its original value (which is 1 in the precondition).***
