`table` is a defaultdict with an integer default factory, and `char` is a character from either `word`, `b`, or `c`. The code increments the count of `char` in the `table` dictionary by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `word` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase English letters, `b` is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters, `c` is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters, and `table` is a defaultdict where the count of each character from `word`, `b`, and `c` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase English letters, `b` is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters, `c` is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters, and `table` is a defaultdict where the count of each character from `word`, `b`, and `c` has been incremented by 1.**
