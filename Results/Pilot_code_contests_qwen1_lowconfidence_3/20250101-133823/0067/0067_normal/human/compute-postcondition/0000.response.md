The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `table` with an integer default factory. This means that `table` is now a dictionary that will automatically assign a default value of 0 to any key that does not yet exist in the dictionary. The lengths and content of the strings `word`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`word` is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters, and there are two more strings `b` and `c` also consisting only of lowercase English letters such that 1 ≤ |a|, |b|, |c| ≤ 105; `table` is a defaultdict with an integer default factory.**
