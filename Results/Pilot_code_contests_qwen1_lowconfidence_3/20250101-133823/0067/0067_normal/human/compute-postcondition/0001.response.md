According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `word`. The loop will execute as long as `word` is not an empty string because it contains characters to iterate over.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Check the `word` string**: The loop will execute if `word` is not an empty string. Since the problem statement guarantees that `1 ≤ |a| ≤ 105`, `word` must contain at least one character.
2. **Initial values of other variables**: The values of `b` and `c` do not affect the execution of the loop since they are not used inside the loop body. Similarly, the `table` dictionary does not affect the loop's execution either.

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can start executing. Specifically, `word` should be non-empty, and the other variables (`b`, `c`, and `table`) can remain as described.

State: **`word` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase English letters, `b` is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters, `c` is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters, and `table` is a defaultdict with an integer default factory**.
