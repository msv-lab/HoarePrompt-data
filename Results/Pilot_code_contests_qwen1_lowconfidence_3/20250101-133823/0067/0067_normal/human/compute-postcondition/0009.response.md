The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `word`. `word` is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters. The function also considers two additional strings `b` and `c`, both consisting only of lowercase English letters, although these are not passed as parameters to `func_1`.

After executing the function body, the function returns a `defaultdict` where the count of each character from `word`, `b`, and `c` has been incremented by the number of times that character appeared in `word`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `word` and return a `defaultdict` where the count of each character from `word`, along with any characters from `b` and `c`, has been incremented by the number of times that character appeared in `word`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `word`, returns a `defaultdict` where the count of each character from `word`, `b`, and `c` has been incremented by the number of times that character appeared in `word`.**
