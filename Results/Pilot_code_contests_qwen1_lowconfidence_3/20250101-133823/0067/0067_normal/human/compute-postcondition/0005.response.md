Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `word` is an empty string.
   - `b` is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters.
   - `c` is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters.
   - `table` is a defaultdict where the count of each character from `word`, `b`, and `c` has been incremented by 1.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for char in word:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in `word`.
   - Since `word` is currently an empty string, there are no characters to iterate over.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - Because `word` is empty, the loop will not execute at all in this case.
   - There is no need to adjust any states since the loop body will not run.

Therefore, the states remain unchanged as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**State: **`word` is an empty string, `b` is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters, `c` is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters, and `table` is a defaultdict where the count of each character from `word`, `b`, and `c` has been incremented by 1.**
