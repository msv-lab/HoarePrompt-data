`table[char]` is incremented by 1. The value of `char` is not specified in the initial state, but it is a character that exists in either `word`, `b`, or `c`. Since the count of each character from `word`, `b`, and `c` has already been incremented by 1 in the initial state, incrementing `table[char]` by 1 means the count of `char` in `table` will be 2 (if it was initially 1) or 1 (if it was initially 0).

The states of the other variables (`word`, `b`, `c`) are not affected.

Output State: **`word` is an empty string, `b` is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters, `c` is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters, and `table` is a defaultdict where the count of each character from `word`, `b`, and `c` has been incremented by 1, with the count of `char` being 2 (if it was initially 1) or 1 (if it was initially 0).**
