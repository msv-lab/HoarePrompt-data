Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program's logic for generating the string \( k \) is flawed. Let's break down why:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the frequency of each character in the input string `word`. However, it does not take into account the frequencies of characters in strings `b` and `c` as required by the problem description.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The main part of the program uses the frequencies of characters from `a`, `b`, and `c` to determine how many times `b` and `c` can appear in the resulting string \( k \).
   - The program calculates the maximum number of times `b` can appear (`maxb`) and then tries to maximize the number of times `c` can appear while ensuring that the total number of characters used matches the length of `a`.
   - However, the program does not properly account for the overlap of substrings `b` and `c`. For example, if `b` and `c` share common characters, the program might not place them optimally to maximize the number of non-overlapping substrings.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     abbaacca
     ab
     ca
     ```
   - The program's output is:
     ```
     abababca
     ```
   - This output is incorrect because it does not maximize the number of non-overlapping substrings. A better solution would be:
     ```
     ababaccab
     ```
   - This solution places two instances of `ab` and two instances of `ca` without overlap, which is the optimal configuration given the constraints.

4. **General Issue:**
   - The program assumes a linear approach to placing `b` and `c` without considering overlaps. It does not ensure that the placement of `b` and `c` is done in a way that maximizes the number of non-overlapping substrings.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic needed to generate the string \( k \) with the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings equal to `b` or `c`. Therefore, the program is incorrect according to the problem description.
