Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the optimal solution involves using both `b` and `c` in a way that maximizes the number of non-overlapping substrings. Specifically, the program's logic for calculating `maxb` and `maxc` and determining the optimal number of occurrences of `b` and `c` is flawed.

Consider the following input:

```
ababab
ab
aba
```

Expected output: `ababab` (This has 3 non-overlapping substrings: 2 instances of "ab" and 1 instance of "aba")

However, the program will not produce this output because it incorrectly calculates the maximum number of occurrences of `b` and `c`. The current implementation only considers the ratio of counts and does not account for the possibility of overlapping and optimal placement of both substrings.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the placement of both `b` and `c` more carefully, ensuring that the total count of characters used does not exceed the length of `a` and that the substrings do not overlap improperly.
