#State of the program right berfore the function call: word is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters, and there are two more strings b and c also consisting only of lowercase English letters such that 1 ≤ |a|, |b|, |c| ≤ 105, where |s| denotes the length of string s.
def func_1(word):
    table = defaultdict(int)
    for char in word:
        table[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `word` is either an empty string or an empty string, `b` is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters, `c` is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters, and `table` is a defaultdict where the count of each character from `word`, `b`, and `c` has been incremented by the number of times that character appeared in `word`.
    return table
    #`The program returns a defaultdict where the count of each character from 'word', 'b', and 'c' has been incremented by the number of times that character appeared in 'word'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `word`, which is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters. It initializes a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each character in `word`. It then iterates through each character in `word`, incrementing the count for that character in the `defaultdict`. After processing all characters in `word`, the function returns the `defaultdict` containing the counts. The function does not directly use the strings `b` and `c`; however, based on the annotations, it seems that the counts from `b` and `c` should also be included in the `defaultdict`. Therefore, the final state of the program is that the returned `defaultdict` contains the counts of each character from `word`, and these counts are incremented by any characters from `b` and `c` that were present in `word`, though no explicit handling for `b` and `c` is shown in the code. This means that if `b` and `c` contain characters not present in `word`, their counts will still be zero in the returned `defaultdict`.
