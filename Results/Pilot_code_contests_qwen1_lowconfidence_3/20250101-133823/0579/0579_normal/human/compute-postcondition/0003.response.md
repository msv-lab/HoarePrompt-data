The code `cntA = Counter(a)` creates a `Counter` object from the list `a`. The `Counter` object counts the occurrences of each element in the list `a`. However, the specific values of `a` are not provided, so we can only say that `cntA` is a `Counter` object that contains the counts of elements in `a`.

The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `b`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `n` is the number of boys (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), `m` is the number of girls (1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5), `k` is the number of couples ready to dance together (1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5), `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, `b` is the return value of `func_2()`, `cntA` is a `Counter` object that contains the counts of elements in `a`**.
