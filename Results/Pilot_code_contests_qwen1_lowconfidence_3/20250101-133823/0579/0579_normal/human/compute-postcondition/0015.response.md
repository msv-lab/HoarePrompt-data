Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but relies on values returned from `func_2()` which provide the number of boys (`n`), the number of girls (`m`), the number of couples ready to dance together (`k`), and two lists `a` and `b` representing the boy and girl numbers in each couple. It then calculates the sum of a specific expression for each couple, which is \( k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1 \), where `cntA` and `cntB` are counters of the elements in lists `a` and `b` respectively. Finally, it prints the average of this sum divided by 2. This process aims to determine the expected number of unique pairs that can form under the given constraints, accounting for possible overlaps between the couples.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `a` or `b` contain duplicate values, the counter calculations may not accurately reflect the unique occurrences of each boy or girl.
- The function assumes that `a` and `b` always contain exactly `k` elements, which is necessary for the loop to run without errors. If `func_2()` does not ensure this, the function may fail.
- The function does not handle cases where `cntA[a[i]]` or `cntB[b[i]]` could be zero or negative, although the current code does not allow for these scenarios since `a[i]` and `b[i]` are constrained to be between 1 and the respective maximum values.
