The function `func_6` accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case:
  - `n`: The number of boys, such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
  - `m`: The number of girls, such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
  - `k`: The number of couples ready to dance together, such that \(1 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
  - `a`: A list of `k` integers such that \(1 \leq a[i] \leq n\), representing the boy number in the `i`-th couple.
  - `b`: A list of `k` integers such that \(1 \leq b[i] \leq m\), representing the girl number in the `i`-th couple.

The function does not explicitly return anything in the given output cases, but based on the parameters, it seems the function processes these inputs and may return some form of output or result related to the couples and their numbers. However, since no specific return values are mentioned in the provided output cases, we can only state the accepted parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t`, and for each test case, the number of boys `n`, the number of girls `m`, the number of couples `k`, and two lists `a` and `b` representing the boy and girl numbers in each couple.**
