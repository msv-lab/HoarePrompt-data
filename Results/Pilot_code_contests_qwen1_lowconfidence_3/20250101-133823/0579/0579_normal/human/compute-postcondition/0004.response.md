The code initializes `cntB` as a `Counter` object containing the counts of elements in `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `cntA` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `cntB` and retains the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `n` is the number of boys (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), `m` is the number of girls (1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5), `k` is the number of couples ready to dance together (1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5), `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, `b` is the return value of `func_2()`, `cntA` is a `Counter` object that contains the counts of elements in `a`, `cntB` is a `Counter` object that contains the counts of elements in `b`**.
