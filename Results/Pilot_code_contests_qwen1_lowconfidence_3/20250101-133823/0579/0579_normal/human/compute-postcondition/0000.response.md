The code `n, m, k = func_2()` calls a function `func_2()` and assigns its return values to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and that `n` is the number of boys, `m` is the number of girls, and `k` is the number of couples ready to dance together. Since the function `func_2()` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from this information alone. However, we know that these variables will hold the return values from `func_2()`, and their ranges are constrained as specified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `n` is the number of boys (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), `m` is the number of girls (1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5), `k` is the number of couples ready to dance together (1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5); `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the function `func_2()`**.
