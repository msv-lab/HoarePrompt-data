`b` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`. The value of `a` is not affected, and the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `n` is the number of boys (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), `m` is the number of girls (1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5), `k` is the number of couples ready to dance together (1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5); `a` is the return value of `func_2()`; `b` is the return value of `func_2()`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `n` is the number of boys (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), `m` is the number of girls (1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5), `k` is the number of couples ready to dance together (1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5); `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, `b` is the return value of `func_2()`**
