According to the given for loop, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is the number of boys (\(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\))
- `m` is the number of girls (\(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\))
- `k` is the number of couples ready to dance together (\(1 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\))
- `a` is the return value of `func_2()`
- `b` is the return value of `func_2()`
- `cntA` is a `Counter` object that contains the counts of elements in `a`
- `cntB` is a `Counter` object that contains the counts of elements in `b`
- `ans` is \(k - cntA[a[0]] - cntB[b[0]] + 1\)
- `i` is 0
- `k` must be greater than 0

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. Additionally, since `k` is the upper limit of the loop and must remain the same unless specified otherwise, `k` should still be greater than 0.
