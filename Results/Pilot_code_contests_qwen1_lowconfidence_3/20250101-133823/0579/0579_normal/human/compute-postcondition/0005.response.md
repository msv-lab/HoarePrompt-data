The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `cntA`, and `cntB` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `n` is the number of boys (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), `m` is the number of girls (1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5), `k` is the number of couples ready to dance together (1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5), `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, `b` is the return value of `func_2()`, `cntA` is a `Counter` object that contains the counts of elements in `a`, `cntB` is a `Counter` object that contains the counts of elements in `b`, `ans` is 0.**
