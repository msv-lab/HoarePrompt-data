Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the number of boys (\(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)), `m` is the number of girls (\(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)), `k` is the number of couples ready to dance together (\(1 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)), `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, `b` is the return value of `func_2()`, `cntA` is a `Counter` object that contains the counts of elements in `a`, `cntB` is a `Counter` object that contains the counts of elements in `b`, `ans` is \(\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1)\), `i` is \(k\), `k` must be greater than 0**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each couple `(a[i], b[i])` where `i` ranges from `0` to `k-1`.
- In each iteration, `ans` is updated by adding `k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1`.
- After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- Since the loop executes `k` times, `ans` accumulates the sum of `k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1` for each `i` from `0` to `k-1`.

If the loop does not execute (`k == 0`), then:
- `ans` remains `0`.
