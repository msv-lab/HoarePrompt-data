The code `a = func_2()` assigns the return value of the function `func_2()` to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `n` is the number of boys (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), `m` is the number of girls (1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5), `k` is the number of couples ready to dance together (1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5); `a` is the return value of `func_2()`.**
