**t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, a, b, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The input lists a_1, a_2, ..., a_k and b_1, b_2, ..., b_k contain unique integers within their respective bounds (1 ≤ a_i ≤ a and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ b). The sums of a, b, and k over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
