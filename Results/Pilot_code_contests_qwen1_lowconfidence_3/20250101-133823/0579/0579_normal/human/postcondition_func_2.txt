The function `func_3()` does not accept any explicit parameters but relies on external input via `input()` to read the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `k`, followed by two lists of integers for each couple. It then returns a list of strings containing the inputs for the next couple's boy and girl numbers. However, the provided annotated code snippet is incorrect; it returns a list of characters from the input instead of the expected list of strings. The correct functionality should involve processing the input data to extract the necessary information about the next couple and returning it as a list of strings.
