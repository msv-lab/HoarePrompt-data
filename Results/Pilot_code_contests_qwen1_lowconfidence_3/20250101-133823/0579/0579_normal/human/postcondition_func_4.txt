The function `func_5` takes a list `l` of integers and a separator string `sep`. It joins the elements of the list `l` into a single string using the separator `sep` and prints the resulting string. There is no modification of the elements in the list `l` before joining them. The function does not return any value; instead, it performs an action (printing the joined string). The function assumes that `l` contains only strings that can be joined. If `l` contains non-string elements, a TypeError will be raised during the join operation. No additional operations involving `sep` are performed as stated in the annotation.
