The function `func_1` prompts the user to enter an integer representing the number of test cases. After receiving the input, it returns this integer. There are no additional actions performed within the function, and it does not process or validate the input further. The function assumes that the user will provide a valid integer input. If the user inputs anything other than an integer, the behavior of the program invoking this function would depend on the input mechanism used (e.g., it might throw an error or behave unpredictably).
