t is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, a and b are integers representing the number of boys and girls in the class, respectively, and k is an integer representing the number of couples ready to dance together. The function takes no input arguments but uses input() to read the values of t, a, b, k, followed by two lists of integers of length k containing the boy and girl numbers for each couple.
