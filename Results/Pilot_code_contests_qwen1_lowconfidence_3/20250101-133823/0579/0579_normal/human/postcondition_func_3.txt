Functionality: The function `func_4()` processes input data for a specified number of test cases. It does not accept any explicit parameters but reads input data from the standard input, which includes the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, the values of `a`, `b`, and `k`, along with two lists `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` and `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k`. The function then returns this input data for each test case, including the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and the lists `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` and `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k`. 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not validate the input data to ensure that `a`, `b`, and `k` are within their specified bounds or that the lists contain unique integers. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the input data is out of range or contains duplicates.
- The function does not handle the case where the total sum of `a`, `b`, and `k` across all test cases exceeds `2 * 10^5`.
- The function does not explicitly terminate or indicate the end of the input data processing; it simply returns the collected data without any additional processing or output.
