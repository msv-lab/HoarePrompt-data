t is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, a, b, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sums of a, b, and k over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. a_1, a_2, ..., a_k are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ a, representing the boy numbers in k possible pairs. b_1, b_2, ..., b_k are integers such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ b, representing the girl numbers in k possible pairs.
