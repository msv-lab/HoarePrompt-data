The function accepts no direct parameters but relies on values returned from `func_2()` which provide the number of boys (`n`), the number of girls (`m`), the number of couples ready to dance together (`k`), and two lists `a` and `b` representing the boy and girl numbers in each couple. It then calculates the sum of a specific expression for each couple, which is \( k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1 \), where `cntA` and `cntB` are counters of the elements in lists `a` and `b` respectively. Finally, it prints the average of this sum divided by 2. This process aims to determine the expected number of unique pairs that can form under the given constraints, accounting for possible overlaps between the couples.
