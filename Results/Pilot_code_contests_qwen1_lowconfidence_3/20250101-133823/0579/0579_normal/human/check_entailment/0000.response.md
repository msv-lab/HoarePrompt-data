Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to select two pairs that match the condition. Specifically, the program does not handle the constraint that no person can be in more than one pair. The current implementation counts pairs in a way that does not ensure this constraint is met.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 4 4
1 1 2 3
2 3 2 4
```

The program outputs `4`, but the correct output should be `4` as well, but the logic to avoid double counting or ensuring no person is in more than one pair is not implemented correctly. The program should iterate through all possible pairs and ensure that the selected pairs do not overlap.

To fix this, we need to use a different approach, such as using a bipartite graph and finding augmenting paths, or using a combinatorial method to ensure that no person is in more than one pair. The current implementation does not account for this constraint properly.
