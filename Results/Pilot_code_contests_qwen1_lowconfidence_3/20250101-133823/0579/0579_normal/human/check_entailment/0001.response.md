Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly calculate the number of ways to select two pairs that match the condition. Specifically, the calculation of `ans` is incorrect. The formula used in the loop to calculate `ans` does not account for the fact that we need to avoid double-counting pairs where a person is in more than one pair.

Let's consider the following case to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

**Test Case:**
- Input:
```
3
3 4 4
1 1 2 3
2 3 2 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
12
```

**Reasoning:**
- For the first test case, the valid pairs are:
  - (1, 2) and (3, 4)
  - (1, 3) and (2, 2)
  - (1, 3) and (3, 4)
  - (2, 2) and (3, 4)

- The program calculates the total count as 12, but it overcounts some pairs. For instance, the combination (1, 2) and (3, 4) is counted multiple times due to the way the loop iterates and the subtraction of counts.

To fix this, a more accurate approach would involve using combinatorial counting while ensuring no person is included in more than one pair. This might require a different algorithmic approach, such as using a bipartite matching algorithm or a more sophisticated counting mechanism to ensure each pair is only counted once.
