You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: At the school where Vasya is studying, preparations are underway for the graduation ceremony. One of the planned performances is a ball, which will be attended by pairs of boys and girls.

Each class must present two couples to the ball. In Vasya's class, a boys and b girls wish to participate. But not all boys and not all girls are ready to dance in pairs.

Formally, you know k possible one-boy-one-girl pairs. You need to choose two of these pairs so that no person is in more than one pair.

For example, if a=3, b=4, k=4 and the couples (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 4) are ready to dance together (in each pair, the boy's number comes first, then the girl's number), then the following combinations of two pairs are possible (not all possible options are listed below): 

  * (1, 3) and (2, 2); 
  * (3, 4) and (1, 3); 



But the following combinations are not possible: 

  * (1, 3) and (1, 2) — the first boy enters two pairs; 
  * (1, 2) and (2, 2) — the second girl enters two pairs; 



Find the number of ways to select two pairs that match the condition above. Two ways are considered different if they consist of different pairs.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers a, b and k (1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of boys and girls in the class and the number of couples ready to dance together.

The second line of each test case contains k integers a_1, a_2, … a_k. (1 ≤ a_i ≤ a), where a_i is the number of the boy in the pair with the number i.

The third line of each test case contains k integers b_1, b_2, … b_k. (1 ≤ b_i ≤ b), where b_i is the number of the girl in the pair with the number i.

It is guaranteed that the sums of a, b, and k over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

It is guaranteed that each pair is specified at most once in one test case.

Output

For each test case, on a separate line print one integer — the number of ways to choose two pairs that match the condition above.

Example

Input


3
3 4 4
1 1 2 3
2 3 2 4
1 1 1
1
1
2 2 4
1 1 2 2
1 2 1 2


Output


4
0
2

Note

In the first test case, the following combinations of pairs fit: 

  * (1, 2) and (3, 4); 
  * (1, 3) and (2, 2); 
  * (1, 3) and (3, 4); 
  * (2, 2) and (3, 4). 



There is only one pair in the second test case.

In the third test case, the following combinations of pairs fit: 

  * (1, 1) and (2, 2); 
  * (1, 2) and (2, 1).

```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to select two pairs that match the condition. Specifically, the program does not handle the constraint that no person can be in more than one pair. The current implementation counts pairs in a way that does not ensure this constraint is met.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 4 4
1 1 2 3
2 3 2 4
```

The program outputs `4`, but the correct output should be `4` as well, but the logic to avoid double counting or ensuring no person is in more than one pair is not implemented correctly. The program should iterate through all possible pairs and ensure that the selected pairs do not overlap.

To fix this, we need to use a different approach, such as using a bipartite graph and finding augmenting paths, or using a combinatorial method to ensure that no person is in more than one pair. The current implementation does not account for this constraint properly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

testing = len(sys.argv) == 4 and sys.argv[3] == 'myTest'
if testing:
    cmd = sys.stdout
    from time import time

        return self.lines[self.ii]

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, a, b, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sums of a, b, and k over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. a_1, a_2, ..., a_k are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ a, representing the boy numbers in k possible pairs. b_1, b_2, ..., b_k are integers such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ b, representing the girl numbers in k possible pairs.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input from the user representing the number of test cases
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` prompts the user to enter an integer representing the number of test cases. After receiving the input, it returns this integer. There are no additional actions performed within the function, and it does not process or validate the input further. The function assumes that the user will provide a valid integer input. If the user inputs anything other than an integer, the behavior of the program invoking this function would depend on the input mechanism used (e.g., it might throw an error or behave unpredictably).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases where each test case consists of integers a, b, and k separated by spaces, and then two lines of k integers each representing the boy and girl numbers in the k possible pairs respectively.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string based on spaces, starting with the integer t followed by t groups of integers a, b, and k separated by spaces, and then k integers each for boys and girls
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the standard input stream, which consists of an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` groups of input for each test case. Each group includes integers `a`, `b`, and `k` separated by spaces, followed by `k` integers for boys and `k` integers for girls. The function then returns a list of integers where the first element is `t`, followed by all the integers from the test cases in the order they were provided, interleaved into a single list. The function accepts no explicit parameters and relies on the standard input. Potential edge cases include when `t` is 0 (no test cases), or when the input format does not match the expected pattern.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, a and b are integers representing the number of boys and girls in the class, respectively, and k is an integer representing the number of couples ready to dance together. The function takes no input arguments but uses input() to read the values of t, a, b, k, followed by two lists of integers of length k containing the boy and girl numbers for each couple.
def func_3():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of strings containing the inputs for the next couple's boy and girl numbers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` does not accept any explicit parameters but relies on external input via `input()` to read the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `k`, followed by two lists of integers for each couple. It then returns a list of strings containing the inputs for the next couple's boy and girl numbers. However, the provided annotated code snippet is incorrect; it returns a list of characters from the input instead of the expected list of strings. The correct functionality should involve processing the input data to extract the necessary information about the next couple and returning it as a list of strings.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, a, b, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The input lists a_1, a_2, ..., a_k and b_1, b_2, ..., b_k contain unique integers within their respective bounds (1 ≤ a_i ≤ a and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ b). The sums of a, b, and k over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_4():
    return input()
    #The program returns input data for each test case, including values of t, a, b, k, a_1, a_2, ..., a_k, and b_1, b_2, ..., b_k
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_4()` processes input data for a specified number of test cases. It does not accept any explicit parameters but reads input data from the standard input, which includes the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, the values of `a`, `b`, and `k`, along with two lists `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` and `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k`. The function then returns this input data for each test case, including the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and the lists `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` and `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k`. 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not validate the input data to ensure that `a`, `b`, and `k` are within their specified bounds or that the lists contain unique integers. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the input data is out of range or contains duplicates.
- The function does not handle the case where the total sum of `a`, `b`, and `k` across all test cases exceeds `2 * 10^5`.
- The function does not explicitly terminate or indicate the end of the input data processing; it simply returns the collected data without any additional processing or output.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers representing the number of ways to choose two pairs that match the condition above for each test case. Each element in the list corresponds to the result of one test case.
def func_5(l, sep):
    print(sep.join(l))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` takes a list `l` of integers and a separator string `sep`. It joins the elements of the list `l` into a single string using the separator `sep` and prints the resulting string. There is no modification of the elements in the list `l` before joining them. The function does not return any value; instead, it performs an action (printing the joined string). The function assumes that `l` contains only strings that can be joined. If `l` contains non-string elements, a TypeError will be raised during the join operation. No additional operations involving `sep` are performed as stated in the annotation.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is the number of boys (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), m is the number of girls (1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), and k is the number of couples ready to dance together (1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5). a is a list of k integers such that 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n, representing the boy number in the i-th couple; b is a list of k integers such that 1 ≤ b[i] ≤ m, representing the girl number in the i-th couple.
def func_6():
    n, m, k = func_2()
    a = func_2()
    b = func_2()
    cntA = Counter(a)
    cntB = Counter(b)
    ans = 0
    for i in xrange(k):
        ans += k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the number of boys (\(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)), `m` is the number of girls (\(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)), `k` is the number of couples ready to dance together (\(1 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)), `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, `b` is the return value of `func_2()`, `cntA` is a `Counter` object that contains the counts of elements in `a`, `cntB` is a `Counter` object that contains the counts of elements in `b`, `ans` is \(\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1)\), `i` is \(k\), `k` must be greater than 0
    print(ans / 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no direct parameters but relies on values returned from `func_2()` which provide the number of boys (`n`), the number of girls (`m`), the number of couples ready to dance together (`k`), and two lists `a` and `b` representing the boy and girl numbers in each couple. It then calculates the sum of a specific expression for each couple, which is \( k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1 \), where `cntA` and `cntB` are counters of the elements in lists `a` and `b` respectively. Finally, it prints the average of this sum divided by 2. This process aims to determine the expected number of unique pairs that can form under the given constraints, accounting for possible overlaps between the couples.
