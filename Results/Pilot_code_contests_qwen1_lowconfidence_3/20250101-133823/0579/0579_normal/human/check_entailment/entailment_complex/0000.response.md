Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the calculation inside the for loop in `func_6` is incorrect. The formula `k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1` is meant to count the number of remaining valid pairs after choosing the current pair `(a[i], b[i])`. However, this formula does not correctly account for the fact that we are selecting two distinct pairs and ensuring no person is in more than one pair.

To illustrate, consider the following example from the problem statement:

- \(a = [1, 1, 2, 3]\)
- \(b = [2, 3, 2, 4]\)

Here, the correct answer should be 4, as shown in the problem statement. However, the current implementation will not produce the correct result because it does not properly handle the selection of two distinct pairs without overlap.

A correct approach would involve using a different method to count valid pairs, such as using combinatorial methods or a more sophisticated counting technique that ensures no person is selected more than once. The current implementation fails to do this correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
