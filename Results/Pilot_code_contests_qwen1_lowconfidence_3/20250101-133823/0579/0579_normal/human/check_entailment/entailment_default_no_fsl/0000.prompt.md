You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: At the school where Vasya is studying, preparations are underway for the graduation ceremony. One of the planned performances is a ball, which will be attended by pairs of boys and girls.

Each class must present two couples to the ball. In Vasya's class, a boys and b girls wish to participate. But not all boys and not all girls are ready to dance in pairs.

Formally, you know k possible one-boy-one-girl pairs. You need to choose two of these pairs so that no person is in more than one pair.

For example, if a=3, b=4, k=4 and the couples (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 4) are ready to dance together (in each pair, the boy's number comes first, then the girl's number), then the following combinations of two pairs are possible (not all possible options are listed below): 

  * (1, 3) and (2, 2); 
  * (3, 4) and (1, 3); 



But the following combinations are not possible: 

  * (1, 3) and (1, 2) — the first boy enters two pairs; 
  * (1, 2) and (2, 2) — the second girl enters two pairs; 



Find the number of ways to select two pairs that match the condition above. Two ways are considered different if they consist of different pairs.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers a, b and k (1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of boys and girls in the class and the number of couples ready to dance together.

The second line of each test case contains k integers a_1, a_2, … a_k. (1 ≤ a_i ≤ a), where a_i is the number of the boy in the pair with the number i.

The third line of each test case contains k integers b_1, b_2, … b_k. (1 ≤ b_i ≤ b), where b_i is the number of the girl in the pair with the number i.

It is guaranteed that the sums of a, b, and k over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

It is guaranteed that each pair is specified at most once in one test case.

Output

For each test case, on a separate line print one integer — the number of ways to choose two pairs that match the condition above.

Example

Input

Note

In the first test case, the following combinations of pairs fit: 

  * (1, 2) and (3, 4); 
  * (1, 3) and (2, 2); 
  * (1, 3) and (3, 4); 
  * (2, 2) and (3, 4). 



There is only one pair in the second test case.

In the third test case, the following combinations of pairs fit: 

  * (1, 1) and (2, 2); 
  * (1, 2) and (2, 1).

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` prompts the user to enter an integer representing the number of test cases. After receiving the input, it returns this integer. There are no additional actions performed within the function, and it does not process or validate the input further. The function assumes that the user will provide a valid integer input. If the user inputs anything other than an integer, the behavior of the program invoking this function would depend on the input mechanism used (e.g., it might throw an error or behave unpredictably).
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function reads input from the standard input stream, which consists of an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` groups of input for each test case. Each group includes integers `a`, `b`, and `k` separated by spaces, followed by `k` integers for boys and `k` integers for girls. The function then returns a list of integers where the first element is `t`, followed by all the integers from the test cases in the order they were provided, interleaved into a single list. The function accepts no explicit parameters and relies on the standard input. Potential edge cases include when `t` is 0 (no test cases), or when the input format does not match the expected pattern.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3()` does not accept any explicit parameters but relies on external input via `input()` to read the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `k`, followed by two lists of integers for each couple. It then returns a list of strings containing the inputs for the next couple's boy and girl numbers. However, the provided annotated code snippet is incorrect; it returns a list of characters from the input instead of the expected list of strings. The correct functionality should involve processing the input data to extract the necessary information about the next couple and returning it as a list of strings.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  Functionality: The function `func_4()` processes input data for a specified number of test cases. It does not accept any explicit parameters but reads input data from the standard input, which includes the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, the values of `a`, `b`, and `k`, along with two lists `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` and `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k`. The function then returns this input data for each test case, including the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and the lists `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` and `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k`. 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not validate the input data to ensure that `a`, `b`, and `k` are within their specified bounds or that the lists contain unique integers. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the input data is out of range or contains duplicates.
- The function does not handle the case where the total sum of `a`, `b`, and `k` across all test cases exceeds `2 * 10^5`.
- The function does not explicitly terminate or indicate the end of the input data processing; it simply returns the collected data without any additional processing or output.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(l, sep='\n'):
    print(sep.join(l))
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` takes a list `l` of integers and a separator string `sep`. It joins the elements of the list `l` into a single string using the separator `sep` and prints the resulting string. There is no modification of the elements in the list `l` before joining them. The function does not return any value; instead, it performs an action (printing the joined string). The function assumes that `l` contains only strings that can be joined. If `l` contains non-string elements, a TypeError will be raised during the join operation. No additional operations involving `sep` are performed as stated in the annotation.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    (n, m, k) = func_2()
    a = func_2()
    b = func_2()
    cntA = Counter(a)
    cntB = Counter(b)
    ans = 0
    for i in xrange(k):
        ans += k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1
    print(ans / 2)
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function accepts no direct parameters but relies on values returned from `func_2()` which provide the number of boys (`n`), the number of girls (`m`), the number of couples ready to dance together (`k`), and two lists `a` and `b` representing the boy and girl numbers in each couple. It then calculates the sum of a specific expression for each couple, which is \( k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1 \), where `cntA` and `cntB` are counters of the elements in lists `a` and `b` respectively. Finally, it prints the average of this sum divided by 2. This process aims to determine the expected number of unique pairs that can form under the given constraints, accounting for possible overlaps between the couples.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
