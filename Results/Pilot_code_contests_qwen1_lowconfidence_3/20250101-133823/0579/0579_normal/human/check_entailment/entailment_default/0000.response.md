Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose two pairs of boys and girls that match the condition. Specifically, the code calculates the number of ways to form pairs, but it does not ensure that the pairs are distinct. The function `func_6` calculates the number of ways to form pairs without ensuring that no person is in more than one pair, which is a requirement according to the problem description.

The formula used in the code:
```python
ans += k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1
```
is intended to count the number of available choices for forming pairs, but it does not correctly handle the constraint that no person can be in more than one pair. This results in overcounting the number of valid pairs.

For example, consider the case where:
- `a = [1, 2, 3]` (boys)
- `b = [1, 2, 3]` (girls)

The code would incorrectly calculate the number of ways to form pairs, leading to an incorrect result. The correct approach would involve checking for distinct pairs and ensuring that no person is used more than once.
