t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is the number of boys (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), m is the number of girls (1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), and k is the number of couples ready to dance together (1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5). a is a list of k integers such that 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n, representing the boy number in the i-th couple; b is a list of k integers such that 1 ≤ b[i] ≤ m, representing the girl number in the i-th couple.
