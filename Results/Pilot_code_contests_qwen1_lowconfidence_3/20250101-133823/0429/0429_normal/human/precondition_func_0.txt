N is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, M is an integer such that N-1 ≤ M ≤ min(N(N-1)/2, 1000), and the following M lines each contain three integers a_i, b_i, and c_i such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ N and 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 1000, representing the edges of the graph where no self-loops or double edges exist, and the graph is connected.
