The code initializes an empty list named `ans`. This operation does not change the values of `N` or `M`, nor does it alter the structure or content of the subsequent M lines (which are not provided in this snippet). Therefore, the only variable that changes is `ans`, which is now an empty list.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `M` is an integer such that N-1 ≤ M ≤ min(N(N-1)/2, 1000), and `ans` is an empty list.**
