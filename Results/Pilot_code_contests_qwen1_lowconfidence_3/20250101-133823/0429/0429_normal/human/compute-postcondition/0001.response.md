The code initializes an empty list `p`. The values of `N`, `M`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `M` is an integer such that N-1 ≤ M ≤ min(N(N-1)/2, 1000), `ans` is an empty list, and `p` is an empty list.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `M` is an integer such that N-1 ≤ M ≤ min(N(N-1)/2, 1000), `ans` is an empty list, `p` is an empty list**
