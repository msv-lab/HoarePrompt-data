`pos[i + 1]` is incremented by `c[i] - 1`. The original value of `pos[i + 1]` was a valid starting point within the range [0, n), and `c[i]` was greater than 0. After executing the code, the new value of `pos[i + 1]` is its original value plus `c[i] - 1`.

Therefore, the updated value of `pos[i + 1]` is `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`, and all other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pos[i + 1]` is `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`; `c[i]` is greater than 0; for every index `j` in the range `[pos[i + 1], min(pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1, n - 1)]`, `ans[j]` is set to `i + 1`.**
