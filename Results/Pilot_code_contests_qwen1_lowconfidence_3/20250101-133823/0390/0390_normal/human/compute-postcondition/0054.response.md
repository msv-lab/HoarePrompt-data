`pos[i + 1]` is incremented by `c[i] - 1`. The value of `c[i]` is greater than 0, so `pos[i + 1]` is increased by `c[i] - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `c[i] > 0`, `ans[j]` is `i + 1` for all `j` in the range `[pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1]`, and `pos[i + 1]` is increased by `c[i] - 1`.

Output State: **`c[i] > 0`, `ans[j]` is `i + 1` for all `j` in the range `[pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1]`, `pos[i + 1]` is increased by `c[i] - 1`**
