To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and requirements step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `c[k + 1] > 0`: This means there are positive values in `c[k + 1]`.
   - `ans[j]` is `k + 2` for all `j` in the range `[pos[k + 2], pos[k + 2] + c[k + 1] - 1]`: This specifies the initial values of `ans` for certain indices.
   - `pos[k + 2]` is increased by `c[k + 1] - 1`: This tells us how `pos[k + 2]` is updated based on `c[k + 1]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` in the range `[pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i])`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute, `pos[i + 1]` must be less than `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`, which simplifies to `c[i] > 0`. This is because if `c[i]` is zero or negative, the range would be empty, and the loop would not execute.
   - The value of `i` is not specified directly but must be such that `c[i] > 0` holds true.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Ensure `c[i] > 0` so that the loop condition is satisfied.
   - Since `c[k + 1] > 0` is already provided, we need to make sure `i` is appropriately set to satisfy the loop condition. 

Given the analysis, the state before the loop starts should include the following adjustments:

State: **`c[i] > 0`, `c[k + 1] > 0`, `ans[j]` is `k + 2` for all `j` in the range `[pos[k + 2], pos[k + 2] + c[k + 1] - 1]`, `pos[k + 2]` is increased by `c[k + 1] - 1`**

This ensures that the loop condition `pos[i + 1] < pos[i + 1] + c[i]` is met.
