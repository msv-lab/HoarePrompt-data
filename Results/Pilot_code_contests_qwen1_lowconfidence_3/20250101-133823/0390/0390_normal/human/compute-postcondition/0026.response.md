Postcondition: **`m` must be greater than 0. If the position difference between `pos[i + 1]` and `pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`, and `c[i]` must be greater than 0, `pos[i + 1]` is defined and valid, `ans[j - 1]` for all `j` in the range `[pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1]` is `i + 1`. Otherwise, the same condition for `m` holds true.**
