`ans[j - 1]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `c[i]` is greater than 0, but the specific values of `i` and `j` are not given, so we cannot determine the exact value of `ans[j - 1]`. However, we know that `ans[j - 1]` is now `i + 1`.

Output State: **`c[i] > 0`; `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`**
