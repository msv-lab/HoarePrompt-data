The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop, the variables remain unchanged after executing the `continue` statement. 

Output State: **`c[i] > 0`, `c[k + 1] > 0`, `ans[j]` is `i + 1` for all `j` in the range \([pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1]\), `pos[i + 1]` is `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`, and `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`.**
