`su` is incremented by `c[i]`. The index `i` is not specified, so it could be any valid index within the range of the list `c`. The value of `su` is updated to include the value at index `i` of the list `c`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `c` is a list of length `n` initialized with values from `rints()`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `m` must be greater than 0, `d` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `pos` is now `[n + 1 - c[0]]`, `su` is `su + c[i]`**
