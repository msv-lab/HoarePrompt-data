The code assigns the value of `i + 1` to `ans[j - 1]`. Based on the initial state, `ans[j + 1]` is `i + 1` and `ans[j]` is `i + 1`. After executing the code, `ans[j - 1]` will also be `i + 1`. The other parts of the array `ans` remain unchanged, and the condition that `c[i]` must be at least 1 remains valid.

Output State: **`c[i]` must be at least 1, `ans[j + 1]` is `i + 1`, `ans[j]` is `i + 1`, `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`**
