Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `c` is a list of length `n` initialized with values from `rints()`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000.
- `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000 and less than or equal to `n`.
- `d` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000.
- `pos` is an empty list `[]`.
- `su` is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Initialization and Condition**:
   - The loop starts with `i = m - 1` and ends when `i` is no longer greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration (`-1` step).

2. **Validating the Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `m - 1` must be a valid starting point, meaning `m - 1` should be within the range `[0, n - 1]`.

3. **Ensuring Validity of `m`**:
   - Since `m` is a non-negative integer and `m <= n`, `m - 1` will always be a valid index for the list `c` as long as `m > 0`.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - The other variables (`c`, `ans`, `n`, `d`, `pos`, `su`) do not directly affect the loop execution condition but are relevant for the loop body if it were to be executed.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 1 (since `m - 1` must be a valid index for the list `c`). Therefore, the state before the loop must include this condition.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `c` is a list of length `n` initialized with values from `rints()`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `m` must be greater than 0, `d` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `pos` is an empty list `[]`, `su` is 0**.
