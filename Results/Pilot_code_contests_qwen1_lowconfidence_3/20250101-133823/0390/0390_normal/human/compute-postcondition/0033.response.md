The code `ans[j - 1] = i + 1` assigns the value `i + 1` to the position `j - 1` in the list `ans`. Based on the initial state, `ans[pos[i + 1] - 1]` and `ans[(pos[i + 1] + c[i]) - 1]` are both already set to `i + 1`. This new assignment does not affect these values but sets a new value at `j - 1`.

Therefore, the updated information is that `ans[j - 1]` is now `i + 1`, while the other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pos[i + 1]` must be a valid starting point within the range [0, n), `c[i]` must be greater than 0, `ans[pos[i + 1] - 1]` is `i + 1`, `ans[(pos[i + 1] + c[i]) - 1]` is `i + 1`, `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`**
