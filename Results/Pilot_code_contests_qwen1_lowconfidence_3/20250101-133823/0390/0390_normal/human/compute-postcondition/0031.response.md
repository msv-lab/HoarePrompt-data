The code assigns the value of `i + 1` to `ans[j - 1]`. According to the initial state, `ans[pos[i + 1] - 1]` is already set to `i + 1`. This means that the assignment `ans[j - 1] = i + 1` effectively updates `ans[j - 1]` to `i + 1`. The other conditions and preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pos[i + 1]` must be a valid starting point (within the range [0, n)), `c[i]` must be greater than 0, `ans[pos[i + 1] - 1]` is `i + 1`, and `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`.**
