The provided code snippet `pos[i + 1] += c[i] - 1` modifies the value of `pos[i + 1]` by adding `c[i] - 1` to its current value. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `ans`, `c`, `pos`, `i`, and `j`. Instead, it provides conditions under which the loop will execute and what the loop will do if it executes.

Given this, we need to focus on the effect of the line `pos[i + 1] += c[i] - 1`. Since the initial state does not specify concrete values, we'll describe the changes in terms of the variables involved.

- The loop updates `ans[j - 1]` to `i + 1` for the specified range.
- The conditions on `c[i]` and `pos[i + 1]` must hold for the loop to execute at least once.

Let's assume the loop has already run and the conditions have been met, and now we are executing the line `pos[i + 1] += c[i] - 1`.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `c[i]` and `pos[i + 1]`, we can only say that `pos[i + 1]` will be updated by adding `c[i] - 1` to its current value.

Output State: **`pos[i + 1]'s value is updated to its current value plus (c[i] - 1)`, the loop has updated `ans[j - 1]` to `i + 1` for the specified range.**
