According to the code, the loop iterates in reverse order from `m-1` down to `-1`. The variable `i` starts at `m-1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `n` remains a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000.
- `c` remains a list of length `n` initialized with values from `rints()`.
- `ans` remains a list of `n` zeros.
- `m` is reduced by 1.
- `d` remains a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000.
- `pos` now includes `[n + 1 - c[0]], n + 1 - su - c[i]`.
- `su` is updated to `su + c[i]`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the value of `i` and ensure the loop condition is met.

1. **Initial Value of `i`:**
   - At the start of the previous iteration, `i` was set to `m - 1`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i >= -1`.

Given that `i` is initially set to `m - 1` and is decremented by 1 in each iteration, the loop will continue if `i` is still greater than or equal to `-1`.

Since `m` is reduced by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the new value of `m` as `m_new = m - 1`.

The new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i_new = m_new - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `i` will be `m_new - 1`.
- `m` will be `m_new`.
- All other variables (`n`, `c`, `ans`, `d`, `pos`, `su`) remain unchanged from their previous values.

State: **`n` remains a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000; `c` remains a list of length `n` initialized with values from `rints()`; `ans` remains a list of `n` zeros; `m` is now `m - 1`; `d` remains a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000; `pos` now includes `[n + 1 - c[0]], n + 1 - su - c[i]`; `su` is updated to `su + c[i]`.**
