The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. However, the `continue` statement itself does not change the values of any variables. It only affects the flow of the loop. The conditions and values of the variables before the `continue` statement remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, the position difference between `pos[i + 1]` and `pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`, `c[i]` must be greater than 0, `pos[i + 1]` is defined and valid, `ans[j - 1]` for all `j` in the range `[pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1]` is `i + 1`.**
