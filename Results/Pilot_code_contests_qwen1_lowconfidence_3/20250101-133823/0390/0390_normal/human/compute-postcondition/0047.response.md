To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- The state before the loop starts includes:
  - `pos[i + 1]` is `min(pos[i] + d, n)`
  - `pos[i + 2]` is `pos[i + 2] + c[i + 1] - 1`
  - `c[i + 1]` is greater than 0
  - For every index `j` in the range `[pos[i + 2], min(pos[i + 2] + c[i + 1] - 1, n - 1)]`, `ans[j]` is set to `i + 2`
  - If `pos[i + 1] - pos[i] <= d`, then `pos[i + 1]` is a valid index, `c[i] > 0`, and `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1` for each `j` in the range `[pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1]`

### Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will iterate from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `pos[i + 1]` must be a valid index and `c[i]` must be greater than 0.

2. **Initial State Constraints**:
   - From the given state, we know `pos[i + 1] = min(pos[i] + d, n)`.
     - This means `pos[i + 1]` is already defined and is within the bounds of `n`.
   - We also know `c[i + 1] > 0`, but this is not directly used in the loop condition.

3. **Ensuring Validity of `pos[i + 1]`**:
   - The condition `if pos[i + 1] - pos[i] <= d` ensures that `pos[i + 1]` is a valid index and `c[i] > 0`.
   - This condition is part of the given state, meaning if this condition holds, `pos[i + 1]` is valid.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `pos[i + 1]` is derived from `min(pos[i] + d, n)` and the condition `pos[i + 1] - pos[i] <= d` ensures its validity, no additional adjustment is needed for `pos[i + 1]`.
   - However, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `c[i] > 0`.

### Conclusion:
The critical state to adjust is `c[i] > 0` to ensure the loop can execute properly.

### Final Answer:
State: **`c[i] > 0`**
