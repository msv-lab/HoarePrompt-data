`pos` is a list that contains the calculated positions based on the sum `su` and the elements in `c`. Initially, `pos` may contain some positions calculated based on `su` and the elements in `c`. The code appends the value `0` to the list `pos`. Therefore, the new list `pos` will include `0` at its end.

Output State: **`c` is a list of length `n` initialized with values from `rints()`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000 and less than or equal to `n`, `d` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `pos` is the list containing the calculated positions based on the sum `su` and the elements in `c` with `0` appended at the end, `su` equals the sum of all elements in `c`.**
