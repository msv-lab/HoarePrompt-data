Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` in the range from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.
   - The condition `c[k + 1] > 0` and `pos[i + 1]` is updated to `min(pos[i] + d, n)` are given before the loop.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `pos[i + 1] <= pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1` must hold true, meaning `c[i]` should be at least 1.

3. **Analyze the Given States:**
   - `c[k + 1] > 0`: This condition is already given, but we need to focus on `c[i]`.
   - `ans[j]` is `k + 2` for all `j` in the range \([pos[k + 2], pos[k + 2] + c[k + 1] - 1]\): This state is not directly relevant to the current loop starting conditions.
   - `pos[k + 2]` is increased by `c[k + 1] - 1`: This state is not directly relevant to the current loop starting conditions.
   - `pos[i + 1]` is updated to `min(pos[i] + d, n)`: This state needs to be considered as it affects the loop condition.

4. **Determine Necessary Adjustments:**
   - Since `c[i]` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure `c[i] >= 1`.
   - We need to consider the initial value of `pos[i + 1]` to ensure it is valid for the loop to start. The updated value of `pos[i + 1]` is `min(pos[i] + d, n)`, so we need to ensure that `pos[i] + d` is within the bounds of the list or less than `n`.

### Final State Adjustment:

- `c[i]` must be at least 1.
- `pos[i + 1]` must be within the valid range, i.e., `0 <= pos[i + 1] < n`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`c[i]` is at least 1, `pos[i + 1]` is within the range `[0, n)`**
