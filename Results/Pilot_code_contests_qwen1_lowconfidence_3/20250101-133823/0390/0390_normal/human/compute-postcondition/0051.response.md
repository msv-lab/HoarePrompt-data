According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `pos[i + 1]` and `c[i]`. The loop runs from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `c[i]` must be at least 1, `ans[j]` is `i + 1`, and `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`.

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to check the current values of `j` and ensure the loop condition allows for another iteration.

Let's break it down:

1. **Determine the starting point of the loop**: The loop starts at `pos[i + 1]`.
2. **Determine the ending point of the loop**: The loop ends at `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.
3. **Current value of `j`**: Since `ans[j]` is `i + 1` and `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`, `j` must be such that `j - 1` is the last index where `ans[j - 1]` was set to `i + 1`.

Given the loop runs from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`, the loop can execute again if `j` is within this range. Since `j` must be incremented by 1 each time through the loop, the next value of `j` would be `j + 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, `j + 1` must be less than or equal to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.

Since `ans[j]` is `i + 1` and `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`, `j` must be at least `pos[i + 1]` (the starting point of the loop). For the loop to continue, `j` must be such that `j < pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j + 1`, and `j + 1` must be less than or equal to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.

State: **`c[i]` must be at least 1, `ans[j + 1]` is `i + 1`, `ans[j]` is `i + 1`**
