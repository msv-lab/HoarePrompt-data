Postcondition: ***`c[k + 1] > 0`, `ans[j]` is `k + 2` for all `j` in the range \([pos[k + 2], pos[k + 2] + c[k + 1] - 1]\), and `pos[k + 2]` is increased by `c[k + 1] - 1`. If `pos[i + 1] - pos[i] <= d`, then `c[i] > 0`, `ans[j]` is `i + 1` for all `j` in the range \([pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1]\), and `pos[i + 1]` is updated to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `c[i]`, `ans[j]`, and `pos[i + 1]` remain as they were.***
