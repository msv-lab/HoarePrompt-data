`ans[j - 1]` is assigned the value `i + 1`. Given that `j` is `j_end + 1`, it follows that `j - 1` is `j_end`. Therefore, `ans[j_end]` is set to `i + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c[i]` is at least 1; `pos[i + 1]` is within the range `[0, n)`; `ans[pos[i + 1]]` is `i + 1`; `j` is `j_end + 1`; `ans[j_end]` is `i + 1`.**
