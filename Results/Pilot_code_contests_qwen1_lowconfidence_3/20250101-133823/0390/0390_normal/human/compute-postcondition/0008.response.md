The code `pos.append(n + 1 - su - c[i])` appends a new value to the list `pos`. Let's break down the impact:

- `n` remains a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000.
- `c` remains a list of length `n` initialized with values from `rints()`.
- `ans` remains a list of `n` zeros.
- `m` must be greater than 0 and will be reduced by 1.
- `d` remains a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000.
- `pos` is a list that includes `[n + 1 - c[0]]` initially. Now, it will also include the value `n + 1 - su - c[i]`.
- `su` will include the next value added from `c[i]`, but since the exact value isn't given, we keep it as `su + c[i]` where `i` is updated.

Since the exact values of `su` and `c[i]` are not specified, we can represent the updated `pos` list as including the new element `n + 1 - su - c[i]`.

Output State: **`n` remains a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000; `c` remains a list of length `n` initialized with values from `rints()`; `ans` remains a list of `n` zeros; `m` is reduced by 1; `d` remains a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000; `pos` now includes `[n + 1 - c[0]], n + 1 - su - c[i]`; `su` now includes `su + c[i]`.**
