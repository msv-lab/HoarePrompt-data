`n`, `m`, and `d` are assigned the values read from standard input using the `rints()` function. The `rints()` function splits the input into a list of integers. The initial conditions of `n`, `m`, and `d` being non-negative integers within the specified ranges are maintained. However, their specific values now depend on the input provided.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are assigned values read from standard input using the `rints()` function, and they are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, d ≤ 1000, and m ≤ n; the list c is unchanged, and the new function `rints` is defined.**
