Postcondition: **`pos[i + 1]` is the cumulative sum of `d` and `c[i] - 1` for each `i` up to `m-1`. `ans[j - 1]` is set to `i + 1` for the range `[pos[i], pos[i + 1])` for each `i` in the range `0` to `m-1`. `ans` contains values indicating the segment assignment for each index in the range `[0, n-1]`. The final output state of the loop after all iterations satisfies `(n + 1 - (pos[-1] + c[-1] - 1) > d)`**
