The code `su += c[i]` increments the value of `su` by the value of `c[i]`. The variable `c` is a list of length `n` initialized with values from `rints()`, and `i` is implicitly an index iterating through this list. Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we know that `c[i]` is one of the elements in the list `c`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` remains a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000.
- `c` remains a list of length `n` initialized with values from `rints()`.
- `ans` remains a list of `n` zeros.
- `m` is now `m - 1`.
- `d` remains a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000.
- `su` is updated to `su + c[i]`.
- `pos` includes `[n + 1 - c[0]]` and `n + 1 - su - c[i]`.

After executing `su += c[i]`, the new value of `su` is the old value of `su` plus `c[i]`. 

The output state is:
Output State: **`n` remains a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000; `c` remains a list of length `n` initialized with values from `rints()`, `ans` remains a list of `n` zeros; `m` is now `m - 1`; `d` remains a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000; `su` is updated to `su + c[i]`; `pos` includes `[n + 1 - c[0]]` and `n + 1 - (su + c[i]) - c[i]`.**
