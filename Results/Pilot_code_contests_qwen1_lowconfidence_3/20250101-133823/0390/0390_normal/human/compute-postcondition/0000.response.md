The given code snippet is a lambda function definition for reading multiple integers from standard input and splitting them into a list. This function does not assign any values to the existing variables `n`, `m`, `d`, or `c`. Instead, it defines a new function `rints` that can be called later to read input. Therefore, the only change is that the new function `rints` is defined.

Output State: **n, m, and d are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, d ≤ 1000, and m ≤ n; the list c is a list of positive integers where each element c_i satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ n, and the sum of all elements in c is less than or equal to n; a new function `rints` is defined which reads multiple integers from standard input and splits them into a list.**
