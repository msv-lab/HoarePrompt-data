The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `d`, which are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, d ≤ 1000, and m ≤ n. It also accepts a list `c` which is a list of positive integers where each element c_i satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ n, and the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to n. 

However, since no specific output is given in the problem statement, we can only describe the input parameters. Based on the provided information, the function does not return any specific value or type of value.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `d` (non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, d ≤ 1000, and m ≤ n), and a list `c` (a list of positive integers where each element c_i satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ n, and the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to n).**
