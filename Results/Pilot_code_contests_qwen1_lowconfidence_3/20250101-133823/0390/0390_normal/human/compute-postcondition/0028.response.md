Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial State
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- The position difference between `pos[i + 1]` and `pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`.
- `c[i]` must be greater than 0.
- `pos[i + 1]` is defined and valid.
- `pos[i + 1]` is updated to be `min(pos[i] + d, n)`.

### Loop Condition
The loop runs as long as `j` is within the range from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Condition for the Loop to Start**: 
   - The loop will start if the range `[pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i])` contains at least one value. This means `pos[i + 1]` must be a valid starting point, and `c[i]` must be greater than 0 to ensure the range is non-empty.

2. **Validating `pos[i + 1]`**:
   - `pos[i + 1]` is defined and valid.
   - `pos[i + 1]` is updated to be `min(pos[i] + d, n)`. This ensures `pos[i + 1]` is within the valid range `[0, n)`.

3. **Validating `c[i]`**:
   - `c[i]` must be greater than 0 to ensure there is a non-empty range.

4. **Initial Values**:
   - We need to ensure that `pos[i + 1]` is a valid starting point within the range `[0, n)`.
   - We also need to ensure that `c[i]` is greater than 0.

### Adjusted States
- `pos[i + 1]` must be a valid starting point (within the range `[0, n)`).
- `c[i]` must be greater than 0.

Given these points, we can summarize the required states:

### Final Answer
State: **`pos[i + 1]` must be a valid starting point (within the range [0, n)), `c[i]` must be greater than 0**.
