Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `c[i] > 0`: This means that the value of `c[i]` is positive.
   - `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`: This means that the element at position `j - 1` in the `ans` array is set to `i + 1`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop runs over the range from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.
   - This means the loop will run `c[i]` times, starting from `pos[i + 1]`.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `c[i] > 0` must still hold true.
   - Since `c[i]` is decremented each time the loop runs, we need to check if `c[i]` is greater than 0 after one iteration.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - After one iteration of the loop, `c[i]` will be decremented by 1 (assuming it is decremented in the loop body).
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `c[i]` must be `c[i] - 1 > 0`.

6. **Updating the States:**
   - `c[i] > 0` will become `c[i] - 1 > 0`, which simplifies to `c[i] >= 1`.
   - `ans[j - 1]` will now be set to the value of `i + 1` at the next position `j`.

7. **Calculating the New `j` Value:**
   - The loop increments `j` with each iteration, so `j` will be `j + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `ans[j - 1]` will be updated to `i + 1` at the new position `j`.

8. **Final States:**
   - `c[i]` must be at least 1 (`c[i] >= 1`).
   - `ans[j]` will be set to `i + 1`.

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`c[i]` must be at least 1, `ans[j]` is `i + 1`**.
