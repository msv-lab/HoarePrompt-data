Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - The condition `c[i] > 0` indicates that the value of `c[i]` must be positive for the loop to proceed.
   - `ans[j]` is set to `i + 1` for all `j` in the range `[pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1]`.
   - `pos[i + 1]` is increased by `c[i] - 1`.

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `m-1`.
   - For each `i`, it sets values in `ans` and updates `pos[i + 1]`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - Let's assume we are at the end of the previous iteration (say the k-th iteration).
   - This means `i = k`.
   - The condition `c[k] > 0` must hold true for the next iteration to proceed.
   - `pos[k + 1]` is updated by adding `c[k] - 1` to its previous value.

4. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will become `k + 1`.
   - Therefore, the condition `c[k + 1] > 0` must be satisfied.
   - `pos[k + 2]` will be updated by adding `c[k + 1] - 1` to its previous value.

5. **Adjusted States:**
   - `c[k + 1] > 0`: This ensures that the loop can continue.
   - `ans[j]` will be set to `k + 2` for all `j` in the range `[pos[k + 2], pos[k + 2] + c[k + 1] - 1]`.
   - `pos[k + 2]` will be updated by adding `c[k + 1] - 1` to its previous value.

Based on this analysis, the required states at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`c[k + 1] > 0`, `ans[j]` is `k + 2` for all `j` in the range `[pos[k + 2], pos[k + 2] + c[k + 1] - 1]`, `pos[k + 2]` is increased by `c[k + 1] - 1`**.
