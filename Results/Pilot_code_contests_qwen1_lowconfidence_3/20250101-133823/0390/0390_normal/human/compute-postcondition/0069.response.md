`ans[j - 1]` is assigned the value `i + 1`. The values of `c[i]`, `pos[i + 1]`, and `ans[pos[i + 1]]` remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `c[i]` is at least 1; `pos[i + 1]` is within the range `[0, n)`; `ans[pos[i + 1]]` is `i + 1`; `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`c[i]` is at least 1; `pos[i + 1]` is within the range `[0, n)`; `ans[pos[i + 1]]` is `i + 1`; `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`**
