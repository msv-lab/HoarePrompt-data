`ans[j - 1]` is assigned the value `i + 1`. The value of `i` is unchanged, and the value of `j` is also unchanged. The range `[pos[k + 2], pos[k + 2] + c[k + 1] - 1]` for which `ans[j]` is `k + 2` remains valid, but now `ans[j - 1]` is updated to `i + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `c[i] > 0`, `c[k + 1] > 0`, `ans[j]` is `k + 2` for all `j` in the range `[pos[k + 2], pos[k + 2] + c[k + 1] - 1]`, `pos[k + 2]` is increased by `c[k + 1] - 1`, and `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`c[i] > 0`, `c[k + 1] > 0`, `ans[j]` is `k + 2` for all `j` in the range `[pos[k + 2], pos[k + 2] + c[k + 1] - 1]`, `pos[k + 2]` is increased by `c[k + 1] - 1`, and `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`**
