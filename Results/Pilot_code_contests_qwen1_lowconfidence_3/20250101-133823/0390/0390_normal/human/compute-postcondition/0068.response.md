To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the for loop statement.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `c[i]` is at least 1.
  - `pos[i + 1]` is within the range `[0, n)` (i.e., `0 â‰¤ pos[i + 1] < n`).
  - `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`.

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs for values of `j` from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, the condition `pos[i + 1] < pos[i + 1] + c[i]` must hold true at the start of the next iteration.
   - This implies that `c[i]` must be at least 1 for the loop to continue, which is already given.

2. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - **`c[i]`:** Since the loop continues as long as `c[i]` is at least 1, there is no change needed for `c[i]`.
   - **`pos[i + 1]`:** `pos[i + 1]` must remain within its range `[0, n)`.
   - **`ans[j - 1]`:** The value of `ans[j - 1]` will change to `i + 1` for each value of `j` in the loop. At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `ans[j - 1]` should be set to `i + 1` for `j` starting from `pos[i + 1]`.

### Final State:
- `c[i]` remains at least 1.
- `pos[i + 1]` remains within the range `[0, n)`.
- `ans[j - 1]` for the next iteration will be `i + 1` for the starting value of `j` being `pos[i + 1]`.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`c[i]` is at least 1, `pos[i + 1]` is within the range `[0, n)`, `ans[pos[i + 1]]` is `i + 1`**
