Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
- `pos[i + 1]` is updated to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.
- `c[i]` is greater than 0.
- For every index `j` in the range `[pos[i + 1], min(pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1, n - 1)]`, `ans[j]` is set to `i + 1`.

### Current Iteration Details
- The loop is iterating over `i` from `0` to `m - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
  - `pos[i + 1]` is updated.
  - `c[i]` is greater than 0.
  - `ans[j]` is set within the specified range.

### Next Iteration Requirements
- For the next iteration (`i` incremented by 1), the loop condition `i < m` must still hold true.
- `pos[i + 2]` needs to be updated to `pos[i + 2] + c[i + 1] - 1`.
- `c[i + 1]` must be greater than 0.
- For every index `j` in the range `[pos[i + 2], min(pos[i + 2] + c[i + 1] - 1, n - 1)]`, `ans[j]` is set to `i + 2`.

### Adjusted States
- The state of `pos[i + 2]` needs to be adjusted to reflect the update from the next iteration.
- The condition `c[i + 1] > 0` must still hold.
- The range for setting `ans[j]` will change based on the new values of `pos[i + 2]` and `c[i + 1]`.

### Final Answer
State: **`pos[i + 2]` is `pos[i + 2] + c[i + 1] - 1`; `c[i + 1]` is greater than 0; for every index `j` in the range `[pos[i + 2], min(pos[i + 2] + c[i + 1] - 1, n - 1)]`, `ans[j]` is set to `i + 2`.**
