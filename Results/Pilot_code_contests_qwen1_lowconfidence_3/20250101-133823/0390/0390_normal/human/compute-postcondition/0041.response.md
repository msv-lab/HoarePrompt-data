Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `pos[i + 1]` is a valid index.
- `c[i]` must be greater than 0.
- `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`.

### For Loop:
```
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `j = pos[i + 1]` to `j = pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.
   - This means the loop will execute `c[i]` times.

2. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - Let's denote the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration as `j_end`.
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each time, at the end of the previous iteration, `j_end = pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `j` will start from `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.
   - Therefore, `j_start` for the next iteration will be `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

4. **Modifying States**:
   - `pos[i + 1]` remains the same.
   - `c[i]` remains the same.
   - `ans[j - 1]` was set to `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `j` starts from `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`, so `ans[j_start - 1]` should be updated to `i + 1`.

### Final State:
- `pos[i + 1]` is a valid index.
- `c[i]` must be greater than 0.
- `ans[pos[i + 1] + c[i]]` is `i + 1`.

### State Adjustment:
- `pos[i + 1]` remains the same.
- `c[i]` remains the same.
- `ans[pos[i + 1] + c[i]]` is `i + 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`pos[i + 1]` is a valid index, `c[i]` must be greater than 0, `ans[pos[i + 1] + c[i]]` is `i + 1`**
