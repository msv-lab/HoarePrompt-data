Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \( c[i] > 0 \)
- \( c[k + 1] > 0 \)
- \( ans[j] \) is \( i + 1 \) for all \( j \) in the range \([pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1]\)
- \( pos[i + 1] \) is increased by 1
- \( ans[j - 1] \) is \( i + 1 \)

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as the range defined by `pos[i + 1]` and `pos[i + 1] + c[i]` is valid.
2. **Update of `pos[i + 1]`**: At the end of the previous iteration, \( pos[i + 1] \) has been incremented by 1.
3. **Range Definition**: The range for the current iteration is from \( pos[i + 1] \) to \( pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1 \).

Given these points, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- **Incremented `pos[i + 1]`**: Since \( pos[i + 1] \) was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be \( pos[i + 1] + 1 \).
- **New Range**: The new range for the loop will be from \( pos[i + 1] + 1 \) to \( (pos[i + 1] + 1) + c[i] - 1 \).

### Updated States:
- \( pos[i + 1] \) is now \( pos[i + 1] + 1 \).
- The range for the next iteration is \([pos[i + 1] + 1, (pos[i + 1] + 1) + c[i] - 1]\).

### Final Answer:
State: **`c[i] > 0`, `c[k + 1] > 0`, `ans[j]` is `i + 1` for all `j` in the range \([pos[i + 1] + 1, (pos[i + 1] + 1) + c[i] - 1]\), `pos[i + 1]` is `pos[i + 1] + 1`, and `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`**
