The code initializes two new variables: `pos` and `su`. 

- `pos` is assigned an empty list `[]`.
- `su` is assigned the integer value `0`.

The values of the other variables (`c`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `d`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is a list of length `n` initialized with values from `rints()`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000 and less than or equal to `n`, `d` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `pos` is an empty list `[]`, `su` is 0.**
