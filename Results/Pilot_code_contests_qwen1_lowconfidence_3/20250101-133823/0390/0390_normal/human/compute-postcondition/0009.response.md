`su` is incremented by `c[i]`. The value of `su` is updated, but the exact value depends on the initial value of `su` and the value of `c[i]`. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code, except that `m` is reduced by 1.

Output State: **`n` remains a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000; `c` remains a list of length `n` initialized with values from `rints()`; `ans` remains a list of `n` zeros; `m` is reduced by 1; `d` remains a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000; `pos` now includes `[n + 1 - c[0]], n + 1 - su - c[i]`; `su` is updated to `su + c[i]`.**
