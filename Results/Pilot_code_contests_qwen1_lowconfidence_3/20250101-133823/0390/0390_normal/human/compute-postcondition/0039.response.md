Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `pos[i + 1]` is a valid index.
- `c[i]` must be greater than 0.
- `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1` must be a valid index.
- `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop runs from `j = pos[i + 1]` to `j = pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is set to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to continue, `j` must become `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

2. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `pos[i + 1]` remains unchanged as it is an index boundary.
   - `c[i]` remains unchanged as it determines the number of iterations.
   - `ans[j - 1]` must now be updated to `i + 1 + 1` (since `j` will increment to `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`).

### Final Adjusted States:
- `pos[i + 1]` is still a valid index.
- `c[i]` must be greater than 0.
- `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1` is no longer relevant since `j` will be incremented.
- `ans[j - 1]` is now `i + 2` because `j` will be `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`pos[i + 1]` is a valid index, `c[i]` must be greater than 0, `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 2`**
