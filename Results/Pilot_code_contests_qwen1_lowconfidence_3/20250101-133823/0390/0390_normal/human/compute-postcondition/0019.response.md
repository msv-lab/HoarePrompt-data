The code `ans[j - 1] = i + 1` assigns the value of `i + 1` to `ans[j - 1]`. The initial conditions and the positions and values of `pos`, `c`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `ans[j - 1]`.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, the position difference between `pos[i + 1]` and `pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`, `c[i]` must be greater than 0, `pos[i + 1]` is defined and valid, `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`**
