`ans[j - 1]` is assigned the value `i + 1`. The value of `i + 1` is already a valid index as per the precondition. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pos[i + 1]` is a valid index, `c[i]` must be greater than 0, `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1` must be a valid index, `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`**
