To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step and deduce the final state of the variables.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over the range `m-1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. This means it starts from `m-1` and decrements until it reaches `-1`.

### Variables Involved
- `i`: The index variable used in the loop.
- `pos`: A list that appends new values in each iteration.
- `su`: Accumulates the sum of elements in the list `c` starting from the last element and moving towards the first.

### Initial Values
- `c`: A list of length `n` initialized with values from `rints()`.
- `ans`: A list of `n` zeros.
- `n`: A non-negative integer between 1 and 1000.
- `m`: A non-negative integer between 1 and 1000 and less than or equal to `n`.
- `d`: A non-negative integer between 1 and 1000.
- `pos`: An empty list `[]`.
- `su`: Initially 0.

### Loop Execution
1. **First Iteration** (`i = m-1`):
   - `pos.append(n + 1 - su - c[i])`
   - `su += c[i]`
   
2. **Second Iteration** (`i = m-2`):
   - `pos.append(n + 1 - su - c[i])`
   - `su += c[i]`
   
3. Continue this process until `i = 0`.

### Final Values
- After all iterations, `su` will be the sum of the entire list `c` because the loop accumulates the sum starting from the last element and moving towards the first.
- `pos` will contain the calculated positions for each element in the list `c`.

### Conclusion
After all iterations of the loop, the variables will be in the following state:
- `c`: Remains a list of length `n` initialized with values from `rints()`.
- `ans`: Remains a list of `n` zeros.
- `n`: Remains a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000.
- `m`: Remains a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000 and less than or equal to `n`.
- `d`: Remains a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000.
- `pos`: Contains the calculated positions based on the sum `su` and the elements in `c`.
- `su`: Equals the sum of all elements in `c`.

### Output State
Output State: **`c` is a list of length `n` initialized with values from `rints()`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000 and less than or equal to `n`, `d` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `pos` contains the calculated positions based on the sum `su` and the elements in `c`, `su` equals the sum of all elements in `c`.**
