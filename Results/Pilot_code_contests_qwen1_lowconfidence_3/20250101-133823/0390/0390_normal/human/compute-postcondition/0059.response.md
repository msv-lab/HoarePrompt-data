The code `ans[j - 1] = i + 1` updates the value of `ans[j - 1]` to `i + 1`. Based on the initial state, `ans[j]` is already set to `i + 1` for all `j` in the range `[pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1]`. Since the code does not change the ranges or the values of `c[i]`, `c[k + 1]`, `pos[i + 1]`, or the values of `ans[j]` outside the specified range, these variables remain unchanged.

Given this, the value of `ans[j - 1]` is updated to `i + 1` while the rest of the conditions remain the same. Thus, the updated values are:

- `c[i] > 0`
- `c[k + 1] > 0`
- `ans[j]` is `i + 1` for all `j` in the range `[pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1]`
- `pos[i + 1]` is increased by 1 (though its new value is not specified)
- `ans[j - 1]` is now `i + 1`

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`c[i] > 0`, `c[k + 1] > 0`, `ans[j]` is `i + 1` for all `j` in the range `[pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1]`, `pos[i + 1]` is increased by 1, and `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`**
