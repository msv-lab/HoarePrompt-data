`ans[j - 1]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i + 1` is a valid starting point as per the initial state. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pos[i + 1]` must be a valid starting point (within the range [0, n)), `c[i]` must be greater than 0, `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`**
