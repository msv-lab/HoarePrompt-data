According to the given code snippet, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range `[pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i])`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:
- `c[i]` is at least 1.
- `pos[i + 1]` is within the range `[0, n)`.
- `ans[pos[i + 1]]` is `i + 1`.
- `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
1. The variable `j` starts from `pos[i + 1]` and increases by 1 each iteration.
2. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

Let's denote the current value of `j` as `j_end` at the end of the last iteration. Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` (let's call it `j_start`) will be `j_end + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j_start` must still be less than `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the current value of `j` at the end of the last iteration:**
   - Let `j_end` be the current value of `j` at the end of the last iteration.
   - Therefore, `j_start = j_end + 1`.

2. **Check the condition for the next iteration:**
   - The loop will continue if `j_start < pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.
   - Substituting `j_start` with `j_end + 1`, the condition becomes `(j_end + 1) < pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - The new value of `j` will be `j_end + 1`.
   - The state of `ans[j - 1]` will change because the loop body updates this value.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, the updated states should reflect:
- `c[i]` remains the same.
- `pos[i + 1]` remains the same.
- `ans[pos[i + 1]]` remains the same.
- The new value of `j` is `j_end + 1`.
- The new value of `ans[j - 1]` will be updated by the loop body.

Since we don't know the exact value of `j_end` but we know it is less than `pos[i + 1] + c[i]` and is incremented by 1, we can summarize the states as follows:

State: **`c[i]` is at least 1; `pos[i + 1]` is within the range `[0, n)`; `ans[pos[i + 1]]` is `i + 1`; `j` is `j_end + 1`; `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1` (updated by the loop body)**

However, to simplify, we can say:

State: **`c[i]` is at least 1; `pos[i + 1]` is within the range `[0, n)`; `ans[pos[i + 1]]` is `i + 1`; `j` is `j_end + 1`**
