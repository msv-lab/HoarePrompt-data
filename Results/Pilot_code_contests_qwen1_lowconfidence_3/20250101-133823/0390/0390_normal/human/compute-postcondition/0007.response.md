Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `c` is a list of length `n` initialized with values from `rints()`
   - `ans` is a list of `n` zeros
   - `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000
   - `m` must be greater than 0
   - `d` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000
   - `pos` is now `[n + 1 - c[0]]`
   - `su` is `su + c[i]`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop runs in reverse order from `m - 1` to `-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value within this range.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range `range(m - 1, -1, -1)`.
   - The current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is `m - 1 - (number of iterations already completed)`.
   - Since we are iterating backwards, the next `i` value will be `i + 1`.

5. **Determining the Next State:**
   - If the loop is to continue, `i` must be within the valid range.
   - The new `i` value will be `m - 1 - (number of iterations already completed - 1)`, which simplifies to `m - 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `total` remains 0.
- `c` remains the same list of length `n` initialized with values from `rints()`.
- `ans` remains a list of `n` zeros.
- `n` remains a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000.
- `m` must be greater than 0 and will be reduced by 1.
- `d` remains a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000.
- `pos` remains `[n + 1 - c[0]]`.
- `su` will include the next value added from `c[i]`, but since the exact value isn't given, we keep it as `su + c[i]` where `i` is updated.

State: **`total` is 0, `c` is a list of length `n` initialized with values from `rints()`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `m` must be greater than 1, `d` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `pos` is now `[n + 1 - c[0]]`, `su` is `su + c[i]` where `i` is updated to `m - 2`**
