Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished executing.

### Initial State
- \( \text{pos}[i + 2] = \text{pos}[i + 2] + c[i + 1] - 1 \)
- \( c[i + 1] > 0 \)
- For every index \( j \) in the range \([ \text{pos}[i + 2], \min(\text{pos}[i + 2] + c[i + 1] - 1, n - 1) ]\), \( \text{ans}[j] = i + 2 \)

### Loop Code
```python
for j in range(\text{pos}[i + 1], \text{pos}[i + 1] + c[i]):
    \text{ans}[j - 1] = i + 1
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### After the Loop Executes 1 Time
- \( \text{pos}[i + 1] \) is a valid index
- \( c[i] > 0 \)
- \( \text{ans}[j - 1] \) is set to \( i + 1 \) for each \( j \) in the range \([ \text{pos}[i + 1], \text{pos}[i + 1] + c[i] - 1 ]\)

#### After the Loop Executes 2 Times
- \( \text{pos}[i + 1] \) is a valid index
- \( c[i] > 0 \)
- \( \text{ans}[j - 1] \) is set to \( i + 1 \) for each \( j \) in the range \([ \text{pos}[i + 1], \text{pos}[i + 1] + c[i] - 1 ]\)

#### After the Loop Executes 3 Times
- \( \text{ans}[j - 1] \) is set to \( i + 1 \) for each \( j \) in the range \([ \text{pos}[i + 1], \text{pos}[i + 1] + c[i] - 1 ]\)
- \( \text{pos}[i + 1] \) is a valid index
- \( c[i] > 0 \)
- \( \text{ans}[\text{pos}[i + 1] + c[i] - 1] \) is set to \( i + 1 \)

From these observations, we can deduce that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the following will be true:
- \( \text{pos}[i + 1] \) will be updated according to the loop logic
- \( \text{c}[i] \) will remain positive
- \( \text{ans}[j - 1] \) for each \( j \) in the range \([ \text{pos}[i + 1], \text{pos}[i + 1] + c[i] - 1 ]\) will be set to \( i + 1 \)

### Final Output State

Output State: **\text{pos}[i + 1] \) is a valid index, \text{c}[i] > 0, \text{ans}[j - 1] \) is \( i + 1 \) for each \( j \) in the range \([ \text{pos}[i + 1], \text{pos}[i + 1] + \text{c}[i] - 1 ]\)**
