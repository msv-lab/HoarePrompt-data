`pos[i + 1]` is assigned the value of `min(pos[i] + d, n)`. This means that `pos[i + 1]` is updated to be the minimum value between `pos[i] + d` and `n`. The other conditions and preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; if the position difference between `pos[i + 1]` and `pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`, and `c[i]` must be greater than 0, `pos[i + 1]` is defined and valid, `pos[i + 1]` is updated to be `min(pos[i] + d, n)`; otherwise, the same condition for `m` holds true.**
