The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **\(\text{pos}[i + 1]\) is a valid index, \(\text{c}[i] > 0\), \(\text{ans}[j - 1]\) is \(i + 1\) for each \(j\) in the range \([\text{pos}[i + 1], \text{pos}[i + 1] + \text{c}[i] - 1]\)**
