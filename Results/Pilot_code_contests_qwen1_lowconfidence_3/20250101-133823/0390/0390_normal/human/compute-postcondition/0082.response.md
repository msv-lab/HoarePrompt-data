Functionality: **The function `func()` accepts three non-negative integers `n`, `m`, and `d` (with constraints 1 ≤ n, m, d ≤ 1000 and m ≤ n) and a list `c` of positive integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ n and the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to n. It then processes these inputs to determine whether it is possible to assign segments to indices in a way that satisfies certain conditions. If it is possible, it prints "YES" followed by the segment assignments; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The function first reads `n`, `m`, and `d` from standard input and stores them in variables `n`, `m`, and `d`. It also reads the list `c` and initializes a list `ans` of length `n` filled with zeros. It calculates a list `pos` that represents the positions based on the cumulative sums of elements in `c` and `d`.

Next, it iterates over the elements in `c` and `pos` to assign segments to indices in `ans` while ensuring that the distance between consecutive segments does not exceed `d`. If the distance between two consecutive positions in `pos` is greater than or equal to `d`, it adjusts the positions and assigns segments accordingly.

Finally, it checks if the last position plus the last element in `c` minus one is within the limit defined by `d` and `n`. If the condition is met, it prints "YES" followed by the contents of `ans`; otherwise, it prints "NO".**
