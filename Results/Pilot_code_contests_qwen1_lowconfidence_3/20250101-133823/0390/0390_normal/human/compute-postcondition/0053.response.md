Output State: **`c[i] > 0`, `ans[j]` is `i + 1` for all `j` in the range `[pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1]`, `pos[i + 1]` is a valid index.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization and Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range `[pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1]`.
   - This means the loop will execute exactly `c[i]` times.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration of the loop, `ans[j - 1]` is set to `i + 1`.

3. **Post-Loop Conditions**:
   - After the loop completes, `ans[j]` for all `j` in the range `[pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1]` will be `i + 1`.
   - `c[i] > 0` ensures the loop executes at least once, and the condition `pos[i + 1]` being a valid index (i.e., `0 <= pos[i + 1] < n`) is maintained throughout.

4. **No Further Changes**:
   - The loop does not change any other variables directly mentioned in the problem statement, so their values remain as they were in the initial state.

5. **Case When Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If `c[i]` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the values of `ans[j]` in the specified range do not change. However, since the problem specifies that `c[i]` is greater than 0, this scenario is not considered here.

Thus, after the loop executes, the values of `ans[j]` in the range `[pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1]` will be `i + 1`, `c[i]` must be greater than 0, and `pos[i + 1]` must be a valid index.
