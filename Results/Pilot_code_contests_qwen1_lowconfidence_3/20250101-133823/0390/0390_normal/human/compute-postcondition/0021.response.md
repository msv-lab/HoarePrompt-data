The code updates the value of `ans[j - 1]` to `i + 1`. The previous conditions and constraints remain valid. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, the position difference between `pos[i + 1]` and `pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`, `c[i]` must be greater than 0, `pos[i + 1]` is defined and valid, `ans[pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1]` is `i + 1`, `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1**.
