Output State: **`c[k + 1] > 0`, `ans[j]` is `k + 2` for all `j` in the range \([pos[k + 2], pos[k + 2] + c[k + 1] - 1]\), and `pos[k + 2]` is increased by `c[k + 1] - 1`; `pos[i + 1]` is updated to `min(pos[i] + d, n)`.**

Explanation: 
- The code updates `pos[i + 1]` to the minimum value between `pos[i] + d` and `n`.
- No changes are made to `c[k + 1]`, `ans[j]`, and `pos[k + 2]` based on the given conditions.
- The condition for updating `c[i]`, `ans[j]`, and `pos[i + 1]` does not apply here because the code is specifically for updating `pos[i + 1]`.
