The code snippet `pos.reverse()` reverses the order of elements in the list `pos`. The previous value of `pos` is a list of calculated positions based on the sum `su` and the elements in `c` with `0` appended at the end. After reversing, the elements in `pos` will be in the reverse order compared to their original positions.

Output State: **`c` is a list of length `n` initialized with values from `rints()`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000 and less than or equal to `n`, `d` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `pos` is the list containing the calculated positions based on the sum `su` and the elements in `c` with `0` appended at the end, but reversed, `su` equals the sum of all elements in `c`.**
