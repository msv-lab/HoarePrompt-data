To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `c` is a list of length `n` initialized with values from `rints()`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000.
- `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000 and less than or equal to `n`.
- `d` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000.
- `pos` is a list containing the calculated positions based on the sum `su` and the elements in `c` with `0` appended at the end, but reversed.
- `su` equals the sum of all elements in `c`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Loop Condition**:
   - The loop `for i in range(m)` iterates `i` from `0` to `m-1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1 because `range(m)` generates a sequence starting from `0` up to `m-1`.

2. **Variables and States**:
   - `c`: List of length `n` with elements initialized from `rints()`.
   - `ans`: List of `n` zeros.
   - `n`: Length of list `c` (non-negative integer between 1 and 1000).
   - `m`: Non-negative integer between 1 and 1000 and less than or equal to `n`.
   - `d`: Non-negative integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `pos`: List containing calculated positions based on the sum `su` and elements in `c` with `0` appended at the end, but reversed.
   - `su`: Sum of all elements in `c`.

3. **Required Adjustments**:
   - Since `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than 0.
   - No adjustments are needed for `c`, `ans`, `n`, `d`, `pos`, and `su` as they are already defined and their values are not required to be explicitly mentioned for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:

The state before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that the loop condition is met. Therefore, the key adjustment is that `m` must be greater than 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`m` must be greater than 0**
