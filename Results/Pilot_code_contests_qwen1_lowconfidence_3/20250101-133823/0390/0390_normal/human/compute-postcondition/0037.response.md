Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial State Analysis
- The initial state before the loop is given as follows:
  - `pos[i + 2]` is `pos[i + 2] + c[i + 1] - 1`
  - `c[i + 1]` is greater than 0
  - For every index `j` in the range `[pos[i + 2], min(pos[i + 2] + c[i + 1] - 1, n - 1)]`, `ans[j]` is set to `i + 2`.

### Loop Condition Analysis
The for loop iterates over the range defined by `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the following conditions are met for the loop to execute:

1. **Condition on `pos[i + 1]`**: The value of `pos[i + 1]` should be a valid index (i.e., non-negative and within bounds).
2. **Condition on `c[i]`**: The value of `c[i]` should be greater than 0, ensuring that there are at least one iteration in the loop.
3. **Bounds Check**: The upper limit of the loop (`pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`) should be a valid index (i.e., it should be less than or equal to `n - 1`).

### Adjusted States
Based on the above analysis, we need to adjust the following states to ensure the loop can execute:

- `pos[i + 1]` should be a valid starting index.
- `c[i]` should be greater than 0.
- `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1` should be a valid ending index (i.e., it should be less than or equal to `n - 1`).

Given these conditions, the final answer is:

**State: **`pos[i + 1]` is a valid index, `c[i]` must be greater than 0, `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1` must be a valid index**
