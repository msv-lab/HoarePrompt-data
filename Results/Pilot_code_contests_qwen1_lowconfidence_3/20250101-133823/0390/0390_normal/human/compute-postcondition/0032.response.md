Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `pos[i + 1]` must be a valid starting point within the range [0, n).
   - `c[i]` must be greater than 0.
   - `ans[pos[i + 1] - 1]` is `i + 1`.
   - `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1` for the current value of `j`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `j = pos[i + 1]` to `j = pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.

3. **Key Points to Adjust:**
   - The loop condition `j < pos[i + 1] + c[i]` must hold true for the loop to execute again.
   - Therefore, after the loop completes, `j` will be equal to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.

4. **Updating the States:**
   - `pos[i + 1]` remains unchanged as it is the starting point.
   - `c[i]` remains unchanged as it is the count of elements to process.
   - `ans[j - 1]` was set to `i + 1` during the loop execution, so it will remain `i + 1`.
   - `j` will be updated to `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

5. **New States:**
   - `pos[i + 1]` must be a valid starting point within the range [0, n).
   - `c[i]` must be greater than 0.
   - `ans[pos[i + 1] - 1]` is `i + 1`.
   - `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1` where `j` is now `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

Putting this together, the new state is:

State: **`pos[i + 1]` must be a valid starting point within the range [0, n), `c[i]` must be greater than 0, `ans[pos[i + 1] - 1]` is `i + 1`, `ans[(pos[i + 1] + c[i]) - 1]` is `i + 1`**
