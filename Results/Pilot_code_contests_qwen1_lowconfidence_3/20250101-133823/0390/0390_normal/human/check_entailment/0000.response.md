Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program attempts to solve the problem but fails to handle certain cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the platforms are placed in a way that allows reaching cell `n+1` from cell `0` within the given constraints. Here is an example that demonstrates the issue:

### Example:
Consider the following input:
```
n = 3, m = 2, d = 2
c = [2, 1]
```

According to the problem description, the goal is to place the platforms such that we can jump from cell `0` to cell `4` using jumps of up to `d=2`. Let's analyze the program's output for this case:

1. The program calculates the positions of the platforms:
   - For the first platform (`c[0] = 2`), the position is `n + 1 - (sum of lengths before this platform) - 2 = 3 + 1 - 2 - 2 = 0`. So, the first platform is placed at positions `[0, 1]`.
   - For the second platform (`c[1] = 1`), the position is `n + 1 - (sum of lengths before this platform) - 1 = 3 + 1 - 2 - 1 = 1`. So, the second platform is placed at position `[1]`.

2. The program then tries to place the platforms and updates the `ans` array accordingly:
   - For the first platform, it places `1`s in positions `[0, 1]`.
   - For the second platform, it places `2` at position `[1]`.

The resulting `ans` array would be:
```
[1, 2, 0]
```

However, this placement is invalid because after placing the first platform, the next jump would be from position `1` to `3`, but position `3` does not belong to any platform, and the next valid jump would require moving beyond the current position, which violates the constraint that all jumps must be within the range `[x + 1; x + d]`.

Therefore, the program fails to produce a valid arrangement of platforms that allows reaching cell `n+1` from cell `0`. This is a clear case where the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Hence, the program is incorrect.
