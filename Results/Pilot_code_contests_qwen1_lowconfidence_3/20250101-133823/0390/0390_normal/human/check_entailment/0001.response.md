Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the sum of platform lengths is less than the required distance `d` for a jump. Specifically, consider the following case:

- Input: `n=10, m=2, d=6`
- Platforms: `c = [4, 3]`

In this case, the total length of the platforms is 7, which is more than `n`, but the longest platform is 4, and the remaining 3 cannot be placed such that a jump of 6 can be made. However, the program will incorrectly place the platforms and claim that it is possible to reach `n+1` from `0`.

To verify this, let's run through the example:

1. **Input:** `n=10, m=2, d=6`
2. **Platforms:** `c = [4, 3]`

The program will place the platforms as follows:
- Platform 1 at position `10 - (4 + 3 - 1) = 3`
- Platform 2 at position `3 + 4 - 1 = 6`

The resulting positions are `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0]`. Since the gap between the end of platform 1 and the beginning of platform 2 is only 2, a jump of 6 is not possible.

The output of the program would be:
```
YES
0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 2 0
```

However, since a jump of 6 is not possible with the current placement, the correct output should be `NO`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
