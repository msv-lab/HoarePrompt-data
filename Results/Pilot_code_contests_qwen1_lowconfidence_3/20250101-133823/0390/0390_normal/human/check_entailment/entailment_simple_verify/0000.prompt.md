You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a river of width n. The left bank of the river is cell 0 and the right bank is cell n + 1 (more formally, the river can be represented as a sequence of n + 2 cells numbered from 0 to n + 1). There are also m wooden platforms on a river, the i-th platform has length c_i (so the i-th platform takes c_i consecutive cells of the river). It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of platforms does not exceed n.

You are standing at 0 and want to reach n+1 somehow. If you are standing at the position x, you can jump to any position in the range [x + 1; x + d]. However you don't really like the water so you can jump only to such cells that belong to some wooden platform. For example, if d=1, you can jump only to the next position (if it belongs to the wooden platform). You can assume that cells 0 and n+1 belong to wooden platforms.

You want to know if it is possible to reach n+1 from 0 if you can move any platform to the left or to the right arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero) as long as they do not intersect each other (but two platforms can touch each other). It also means that you cannot change the relative order of platforms.

Note that you should move platforms until you start jumping (in other words, you first move the platforms and then start jumping).

For example, if n=7, m=3, d=2 and c = [1, 2, 1], then one of the ways to reach 8 from 0 is follow:

<image> The first example: n=7.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers n, m and d (1 ≤ n, m, d ≤ 1000, m ≤ n) — the width of the river, the number of platforms and the maximum distance of your jump, correspondingly.

The second line of the input contains m integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_m (1 ≤ c_i ≤ n, ∑_{i=1}^{m} c_i ≤ n), where c_i is the length of the i-th platform.

Output

If it is impossible to reach n+1 from 0, print NO in the first line. Otherwise, print YES in the first line and the array a of length n in the second line — the sequence of river cells (excluding cell 0 and cell n + 1).

If the cell i does not belong to any platform, a_i should be 0. Otherwise, it should be equal to the index of the platform (1-indexed, platforms are numbered from 1 to m in order of input) to which the cell i belongs.

Note that all a_i equal to 1 should form a contiguous subsegment of the array a of length c_1, all a_i equal to 2 should form a contiguous subsegment of the array a of length c_2, ..., all a_i equal to m should form a contiguous subsegment of the array a of length c_m. The leftmost position of 2 in a should be greater than the rightmost position of 1, the leftmost position of 3 in a should be greater than the rightmost position of 2, ..., the leftmost position of m in a should be greater than the rightmost position of m-1.

See example outputs for better understanding.

Note

Consider the first example: the answer is [0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3]. The sequence of jumps you perform is 0 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 7 → 8.

Consider the second example: it does not matter how to place the platform because you always can jump from 0 to 11.

Consider the third example: the answer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The sequence of jumps you perform is 0 → 5 → 6 → 11.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program attempts to solve the problem but fails to handle certain cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the platforms are placed in a way that allows reaching cell `n+1` from cell `0` within the given constraints. Here is an example that demonstrates the issue:

### Example:
Consider the following input:
```
n = 3, m = 2, d = 2
c = [2, 1]
```

According to the problem description, the goal is to place the platforms such that we can jump from cell `0` to cell `4` using jumps of up to `d=2`. Let's analyze the program's output for this case:

1. The program calculates the positions of the platforms:
   - For the first platform (`c[0] = 2`), the position is `n + 1 - (sum of lengths before this platform) - 2 = 3 + 1 - 2 - 2 = 0`. So, the first platform is placed at positions `[0, 1]`.
   - For the second platform (`c[1] = 1`), the position is `n + 1 - (sum of lengths before this platform) - 1 = 3 + 1 - 2 - 1 = 1`. So, the second platform is placed at position `[1]`.

2. The program then tries to place the platforms and updates the `ans` array accordingly:
   - For the first platform, it places `1`s in positions `[0, 1]`.
   - For the second platform, it places `2` at position `[1]`.

The resulting `ans` array would be:
```
[1, 2, 0]
```

However, this placement is invalid because after placing the first platform, the next jump would be from position `1` to `3`, but position `3` does not belong to any platform, and the next valid jump would require moving beyond the current position, which violates the constraint that all jumps must be within the range `[x + 1; x + d]`.

Therefore, the program fails to produce a valid arrangement of platforms that allows reaching cell `n+1` from cell `0`. This is a clear case where the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Hence, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from sys import stdin

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and d are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, d ≤ 1000, and m ≤ n. The list c is a list of positive integers where each element c_i satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ n, and the sum of all elements in c is less than or equal to n.
def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    n, m, d = rints()
    c, ans = rints(), [0] * n
    pos, su = [], 0
    for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
        pos.append(n + 1 - su - c[i])
        
        su += c[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `c` is a list of length `n` initialized with values from `rints()`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000 and less than or equal to `n`, `d` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `pos` contains the calculated positions based on the sum `su` and the elements in `c`, `su` equals the sum of all elements in `c`.
    pos.append(0)
    pos.reverse()
    for i in range(m):
        if pos[i + 1] - pos[i] <= d:
            for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
                ans[j - 1] = i + 1
            continue
        
        pos[i + 1] = min(pos[i] + d, n)
        
        for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
            ans[j - 1] = i + 1
        
        pos[i + 1] += c[i] - 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: - `pos[i + 1]` is the cumulative sum of `d` and `c[i] - 1` for each `i` up to `m-1`.
    #- `ans[j - 1]` is set to `i + 1` for the range `[pos[i], pos[i + 1])` for each `i` in the range `0` to `m-1`.
    #- `ans` contains values indicating the segment assignment for each index in the range `[0, n-1]`.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state of the loop after all iterations is:
    #
    #Output State:
    if (n + 1 - (pos[-1] + c[-1] - 1) > d) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        print('YES')
        print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`pos[i + 1]` is the cumulative sum of `d` and `c[i] - 1` for each `i` up to `m-1`; `ans[j - 1]` is set to `i + 1` for the range `[pos[i], pos[i + 1])` for each `i` in the range `0` to `m-1`; `ans` contains values indicating the segment assignment for each index in the range `[0, n-1]`; if the condition `(n + 1 - (pos[-1] + c[-1] - 1) > d)` is satisfied, 'NO' is printed; otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
