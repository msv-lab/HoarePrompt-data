Correctness: **False**

### Explanation

The provided annotated program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Platform Positions:**
   - The program calculates the positions of the platforms starting from the end and moving towards the beginning. However, it does not ensure that the platforms are placed correctly based on the constraints and the requirement to reach \( n + 1 \).
   - Specifically, the positions are calculated as \( n + 1 - \text{sum of lengths} - c_i \), which is not aligned with the requirement to place platforms such that you can jump to the next platform within the allowed distance \( d \).

2. **Jump Logic and Placement:**
   - The logic for placing platforms and ensuring that jumps can be made within the allowed distance \( d \) is not correctly implemented. The program attempts to place platforms and then adjusts their positions based on the distance constraint, but this approach is flawed.
   - The placement of platforms and the logic for ensuring that you can jump from one platform to another within the allowed distance \( d \) are not correctly handled.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' and the array `ans`. However, the logic to determine whether it's possible to reach \( n + 1 \) is not correctly implemented.
   - The final check `if (n + 1 - (pos[-1] + c[-1] - 1) > d)` is incorrect and does not properly validate if the last platform can be reached.

### Correct Implementation Overview

To correctly implement the solution, the program needs to:
1. Calculate the positions of the platforms such that they are placed optimally to allow jumps within the allowed distance \( d \).
2. Ensure that the placement of platforms does not violate the constraints and allows for reaching \( n + 1 \).
3. Output 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether it is possible to reach \( n + 1 \) and the array `ans` if possible.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic and thus is not correct according to the problem description.
