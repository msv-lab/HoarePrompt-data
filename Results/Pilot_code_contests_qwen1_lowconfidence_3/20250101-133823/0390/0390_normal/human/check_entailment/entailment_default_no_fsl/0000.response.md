Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the code fails to ensure that the platforms are placed in a way that allows reaching cell `n+1` from cell `0` using jumps of length `d`. Here are some issues identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Platform Positions**: The code calculates the positions of the platforms incorrectly. It starts placing the platforms from the end and works backwards, which can lead to incorrect placements. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   7 3 2
   1 2 1
   ```
   The correct positions for the platforms should be `[1, 3, 5]` to allow jumping from `0` to `2` to `4` to `5` to `7` to `8`. However, the code places the platforms at `[5, 3, 1]`, which does not allow a valid path.

2. **Adjustment of Positions**: The adjustment of positions within the loop does not always ensure that the jumps are valid. For example, if the distance between two platforms is greater than `d`, the code simply shifts the next platform without considering the previous ones, which can lead to invalid configurations. This is evident in the hint example provided.

3. **Final Check**: The final check to ensure that the last platform can be reached from the starting point is insufficient. It only checks if the last platform's end position plus its length minus one is within the limit defined by `d` and `n`. This does not guarantee that the entire path from `0` to `n+1` is valid.

To illustrate, let's consider the following test case:
```
7 3 2
1 2 1
```

The correct output should be:
```
YES
0 1 0 2 2 0 3
```

However, the given code produces an incorrect output. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and thus the correctness is **False**.
