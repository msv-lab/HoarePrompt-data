Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the platforms are placed in a way that allows for a valid path from cell 0 to cell n+1 using jumps of up to `d` cells.

Hereâ€™s an example where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
n = 10
m = 2
d = 5
c = [3, 3]
```

In this case, the platforms are of length 3 and 3, and they can be placed at positions that allow jumps of up to 5 cells. However, the program does not ensure that the platforms are placed in a way that allows reaching cell 11 from cell 0.

The program calculates the positions of the platforms in reverse order, but it does not correctly handle the placement of the platforms to ensure a valid path. Specifically, the program does not consider the possibility of placing the platforms in a way that ensures a continuous path with jumps up to `d` cells.

For instance, if the platforms are placed at positions 8 and 5 (from the right), the program will not correctly adjust the positions to ensure a valid path. The program should check and adjust the positions of the platforms to ensure that the distance between consecutive platforms does not exceed `d` and that the path from 0 to n+1 is valid.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the platforms are placed in a way that allows for valid jumps. This might involve more complex logic to adjust the positions of the platforms to ensure a continuous path.
