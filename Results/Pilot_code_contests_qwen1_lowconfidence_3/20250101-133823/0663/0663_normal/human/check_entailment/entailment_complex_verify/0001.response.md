Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies the issue with the program. The provided code uses a formula that works for even \( n \), but the problem description specifies that \( n \) is always odd. The annotated version confirms that the program does not handle the case when \( n \) is odd, which is a requirement specified in the problem. The formula used in the program is derived for even \( n \) and will not yield the correct results for odd \( n \). Therefore, the program cannot meet the problem description as stated.
