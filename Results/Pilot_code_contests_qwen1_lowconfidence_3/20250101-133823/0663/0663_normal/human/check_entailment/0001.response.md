Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not handle the case when \( n \) is odd, which is a requirement specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program is designed to work with even \( n \), but since the problem states that \( n \) is always odd, the formula used in the program will not be applicable. 

For example, consider the case when \( n = 3 \):
- The correct approach would be to calculate the square's side length that can contain a hexagon (2n-gon where \( n = 3 \)), but the provided formula is designed for even \( n \).
- The correct value for \( n = 3 \) (which corresponds to a hexagon) is approximately 2.414213562, but the program will not produce this result because it is designed for even \( n \).

Since the program does not account for odd \( n \), it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
