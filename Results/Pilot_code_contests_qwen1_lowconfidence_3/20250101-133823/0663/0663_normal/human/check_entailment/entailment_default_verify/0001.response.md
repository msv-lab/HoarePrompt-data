Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program is designed to work with even values of \( n \), but the problem specifies that \( n \) is always odd. The output hints further confirm that the program uses a formula intended for even \( n \). Since the program does not account for the case when \( n \) is odd, it cannot correctly solve the problem for all given inputs. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness as **False** remains valid.
