Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. The formula used in the code is intended to calculate the minimum side length of a square that can contain a \(2n\)-gon. However, the formula \(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \cdot \sqrt{2}\) is not correct for determining the minimum side length of the square.

To understand why this is incorrect, let's consider the geometry of the problem:

- For a regular \(2n\)-gon inscribed in a circle of radius \(r\), the distance between two adjacent vertices is \(2r \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)\).
- The height of the \(2n\)-gon (which is the distance between the topmost and bottommost vertices) is \(2r \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)\).

The side length of the smallest square that can contain the \(2n\)-gon is equal to the height of the \(2n\)-gon, which is \(2r \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)\). Given that the side length of each side of the \(2n\)-gon is 1, the radius \(r\) of the circumscribed circle is \(\frac{1}{2 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}\).

Thus, the minimum side length of the square is:
\[ 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right) = \frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} = \cot\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right) \]

The provided code instead calculates \(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \cdot \sqrt{2}\), which does not match the correct formula. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case.
