Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to calculate the minimum side length of a square that can embed a 2n-gon, but it does not correctly implement the formula. The provided formula in the program is incorrect. Specifically, the formula used is:

\[ \text{side\_length} = \frac{\sin(\pi / 4 + \pi / (2 \cdot n))}{\sin(\pi / (2 \cdot n))} \times \sqrt{2} \]

However, this formula is derived from a specific geometric property that might not hold for all values of \( n \). For instance, for \( n = 2 \), the 2n-gon is actually a square itself, and the minimum side length of the square that can embed it is 1. The program correctly outputs 1.000000000 for \( n = 2 \).

But for other values of \( n \), the formula might not give the correct result. For example, for \( n = 4 \), the 2n-gon is an octagon, and the correct minimum side length of the square that can embed it is \( 2 - \sqrt{2} \approx 0.585786438 \), but the program outputs approximately 2.414213562, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
