Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code calculates the square of the minimum size for embedding a 2n-gon using the formula \(\cot\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right) + 2\), which is equivalent to \(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \cdot \sqrt{2}\). However, the output hints suggest that the correct formula to use is \(\cot\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right) + 2\), not the one used in the code. 

The code uses the formula \(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \cdot \sqrt{2}\), which is incorrect. The correct formula for the cotangent is \(\cot\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right) + 2\).

For example, for \(n = 2\):
- The correct answer should be \(\cot\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3\).
- The code calculates \(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{4}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} \cdot \sqrt{2} = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} \cdot \sqrt{2} = \frac{1}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 2\).

Since the code uses the wrong formula, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
