You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The statement of this problem is the same as the statement of problem C2. The only difference is that, in problem C1, n is always even, and in C2, n is always odd.

You are given a regular polygon with 2 ⋅ n vertices (it's convex and has equal sides and equal angles) and all its sides have length 1. Let's name it as 2n-gon.

Your task is to find the square of the minimum size such that you can embed 2n-gon in the square. Embedding 2n-gon in the square means that you need to place 2n-gon in the square in such way that each point which lies inside or on a border of 2n-gon should also lie inside or on a border of the square.

You can rotate 2n-gon and/or the square.

Input

The first line contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 200) — the number of test cases.

Next T lines contain descriptions of test cases — one per line. Each line contains single even integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200). Don't forget you need to embed 2n-gon, not an n-gon.

Output

Print T real numbers — one per test case. For each test case, print the minimum length of a side of the square 2n-gon can be embedded in. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10^{-6}.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from math import sin,pi,sqrt

#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 200, and for each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200.
def func():
    for _ in range(input()):
        n = input()
        
        print(sin(pi / 4 + pi / (2 * n)) / sin(pi / (2 * n))) * sqrt(2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: T is the number of test cases, `n` is the last input value received, the printed value is `cot(pi / (2 * n)) + 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases with parameters \(T\) and \(n\) where \(1 \leq T \leq 200\) and \(2 \leq n \leq 200\) (with \(n\) being even). For each test case, it calculates and prints the value of \(\cot\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right) + 2\), which is equivalent to \(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \cdot \sqrt{2}\). If \(n\) is less than 2, the function should return an error message, although the provided code does not explicitly handle this case. After processing all test cases, the program prints the calculated value for the last test case.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
