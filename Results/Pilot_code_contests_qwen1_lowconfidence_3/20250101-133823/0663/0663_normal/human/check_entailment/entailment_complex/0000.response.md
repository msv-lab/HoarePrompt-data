Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program calculates and prints \(\cot\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right) + 2\) for each test case, whereas the problem requires finding the square of the minimum size such that a 2n-gon can be embedded within it.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should calculate the side length of the smallest square that can contain a 2n-gon with side length 1. Given the geometry of a regular 2n-gon, the key insight is that the diameter of the circumscribed circle of the 2n-gon is the critical dimension to determine the side length of the containing square.

The correct formula to use is:
\[ \text{Side length of the square} = \frac{2}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \]

However, the provided program uses a different formula:
\[ \text{Printed value} = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \cdot \sqrt{2} \]

This formula does not directly relate to the required side length of the square. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.

In summary, the program incorrectly implements the calculation needed to find the minimum square side length that can contain a 2n-gon, leading to an incorrect output for the given problem.
