Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The annotated program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically:

1. **Problem Description Requirements**:
   - The problem requires finding the square of the minimum size such that a \(2n\)-gon can be embedded within it.
   - The solution involves computing the side length of the square that can contain the \(2n\)-gon.

2. **Program Implementation**:
   - The annotated program uses the formula \(\text{print}( \frac{\sin(\pi / 4 + \pi / (2 * n))}{\sin(\pi / (2 * n))} ) * \sqrt{2}\).
   - This formula is attempting to compute the cotangent of \(\pi / (2 * n)\), but it is not correctly derived for the problem.

3. **Correct Formula**:
   - To find the side length of the smallest square that can contain a \(2n\)-gon, the correct formula is \(\text{side\_length} = \frac{2}{\sin(\pi / n)}\).

4. **Why the Program is Incorrect**:
   - The formula used in the program does not accurately represent the relationship between the side length of the \(2n\)-gon and the side length of the containing square.
   - The correct approach would involve using the geometry of the \(2n\)-gon to derive the required side length of the square.

To illustrate why the given program is incorrect, consider the following:
- For \(n = 2\), the \(2n\)-gon is a square with side length 1. The side length of the smallest square that can contain this square is clearly 1, but the program outputs \(\frac{1}{\sin(\pi / 4)} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\), which is incorrect.
- For \(n = 4\), the \(2n\)-gon is a regular octagon. The correct side length of the smallest square that can contain it is \(\frac{2}{\sin(\pi / 4)} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\), but the program outputs \(\frac{\sin(\pi / 4 + \pi / 8)}{\sin(\pi / 8)} \approx 2.414\), which is also incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.
