Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases with parameters \(T\) and \(n\) where \(1 \leq T \leq 200\) and \(2 \leq n \leq 200\) (with \(n\) being even). For each test case, it calculates and prints the value of \(\cot\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right) + 2\), which is equivalent to \(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \cdot \sqrt{2}\). If \(n\) is less than 2, the function should return an error message, although the provided code does not explicitly handle this case. After processing all test cases, the program prints the calculated value for the last test case.**

Note: The provided code does not include explicit error handling for \(n < 2\). Therefore, it is assumed that \(n\) will always be within the valid range [2, 200] as per the problem constraints.
