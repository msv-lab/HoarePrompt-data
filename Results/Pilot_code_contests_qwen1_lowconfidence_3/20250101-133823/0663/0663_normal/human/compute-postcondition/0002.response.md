`n` is assigned the value returned by `input()`, and it is at least 1. The code calculates the value of the expression `sin(pi / 4 + pi / (2 * n)) / sin(pi / (2 * n)) * sqrt(2)`. However, since `n` is only known to be at least 1 and no specific value is provided, the exact numerical value cannot be determined. But the expression itself remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1; the expression `sin(pi / 4 + pi / (2 * n)) / sin(pi / (2 * n)) * sqrt(2)` has been evaluated but its specific value is not known.**
