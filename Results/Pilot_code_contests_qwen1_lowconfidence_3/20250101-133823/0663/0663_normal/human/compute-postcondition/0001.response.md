The code `n = input()` assigns the value returned by the `input()` function to the variable `n`. Given the precondition that `input()` must return a value that is at least 1, the value of `n` will be that value. The other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the value returned by `input()`, which is at least 1**
