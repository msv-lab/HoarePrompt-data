Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `n` is input()
   - The printed value is `cot(pi / (2 * n)) + 2`

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for _ in range(input())`. This means the loop will run for as many times as the value of `input()`.

3. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop itself does not change the values of `n` or perform any operations that affect the loop's continuation directly. However, the loop counter will increment each time the loop runs.

4. **Previous Iteration Analysis**: At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `input()` was used to determine the number of iterations. Let's denote this value as `k`.

5. **Current Iteration**: For the next iteration to occur, the value of `input()` must be decremented by 1 from its previous value `k`. This is because the loop counter `_` is incremented with each iteration.

6. **Updated State**: The updated state for the next iteration should reflect the new value of `input()`, which is `k - 1`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `n` is the previous input value `k`
- The printed value for the next iteration would be `cot(pi / (2 * (k - 1))) + 2`

Therefore, the state for the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is the previous input value `k`, the printed value is `cot(pi / (2 * (k - 1))) + 2`**
