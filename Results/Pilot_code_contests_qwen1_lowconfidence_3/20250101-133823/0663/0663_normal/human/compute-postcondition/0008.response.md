The code calculates a value using `sin` and `sqrt` functions and prints it. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this code. The printed value depends on `n`. 

The expression inside the print statement simplifies as follows:
- `sin(pi / 4 + pi / (2 * n)) / sin(pi / (2 * n)) * sqrt(2)` is a function of `n`.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `n`, we keep `n` as `n` in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is the new input value, `k` is the previous input value, the printed value is `sin(pi / 4 + pi / (2 * n)) / sin(pi / (2 * n)) * sqrt(2)`**
