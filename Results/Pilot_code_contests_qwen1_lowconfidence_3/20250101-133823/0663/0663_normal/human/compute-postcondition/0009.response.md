Output State: **T is the number of test cases, `n` is the last input value received, the printed value is `cot(pi / (2 * n)) + 2`.**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 200\).
   - For each test case, `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200\).

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```python
   for _ in range(T):
       n = input()
       print(sin(pi / 4 + pi / (2 * n)) / sin(pi / (2 * n)) * sqrt(2))
   ```

3. **Output State After 1 Iteration**:
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - The expression `sin(pi / 4 + pi / (2 * n)) / sin(pi / (2 * n)) * sqrt(2)` has been evaluated but its specific value is not known.

4. **Output State After 2 Iterations**:
   - `n` is the new input value (let’s call it \(n_2\)).
   - The printed value is `cot(pi / (2 * n_2)) + 2`.

5. **Output State After 3 Iterations**:
   - `n` is the last input value received (let’s call it \(n_3\)).
   - `k` is the previous input value (let’s call it \(n_2\)).
   - The printed value is `sin(pi / 4 + pi / (2 * n_3)) / sin(pi / (2 * n_3)) * sqrt(2)`.

6. **General Case**:
   - After all iterations, `n` will be the last input value received during the execution of the loop.
   - The printed value for each iteration is `cot(pi / (2 * n_i)) + 2`, where \(n_i\) is the value of `n` for that particular iteration.
   - Since the loop will iterate `T` times, `n` will be the value of the last input, and the printed value will be the result of the last iteration's expression.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - `T` remains the same throughout the loop as it is the count of test cases.
   - `n` will be the last input value received.
   - The printed value after all iterations is `cot(pi / (2 * n)) + 2`.

Thus, the final output state is:
**Output State: **T is the number of test cases, `n` is the last input value received, the printed value is `cot(pi / (2 * n)) + 2`.**
