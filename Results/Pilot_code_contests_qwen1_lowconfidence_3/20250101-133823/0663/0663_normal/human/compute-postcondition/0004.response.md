`n` is assigned the value of `input()`. The specific value of the expression `sin(pi / 4 + pi / (2 * n)) / sin(pi / (2 * n)) * sqrt(2)` remains unchanged, but its value is now dependent on the input for `n`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is input(), the expression `sin(pi / 4 + pi / (2 * n)) / sin(pi / (2 * n)) * sqrt(2)` has a specific value but it is not known**
