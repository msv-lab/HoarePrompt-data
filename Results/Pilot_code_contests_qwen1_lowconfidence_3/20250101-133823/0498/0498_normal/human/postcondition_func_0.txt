The function processes a series of points \((x, y)\) and their corresponding weights \(w_i\). It checks if the points form a valid grid where each cell \((x, y)\) is assigned a unique label based on the weights of the points that cover it. If the points and weights satisfy certain conditions, it outputs "YES" followed by the labels of the points. Otherwise, it outputs "NO". The function ensures that the labels are consistent with the given weights and the grid structure. If any inconsistency is found, it exits early with "NO".
