Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the code fails to ensure that the numbering of points is aesthetically pleasing according to the given constraints. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Points and Labels**: The code attempts to assign labels to points based on the weights, but it does not properly enforce the condition that if some point \((x, y)\) gets number \(i\), then all points \((x', y')\) such that \(x' \geq x\) and \(y' \geq y\) must be assigned a number not less than \(i\).

2. **Sorting and Popping Logic**: The code sorts the points in reverse order and pops elements from the list, but it does not guarantee that the labels are assigned correctly across the entire grid. The sorting and popping logic might lead to incorrect assignments, especially for points that are not directly adjacent but still need to maintain the aesthetic condition.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The code does not handle edge cases where the grid structure is more complex, such as points that are not directly adjacent but still need to maintain the aesthetic condition. For example, if there are points \((x, y)\) and \((x+1, y)\) with different weights, the code might incorrectly assign labels, violating the aesthetic condition.

Given these issues, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
