You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Wilbur is playing with a set of n points on the coordinate plane. All points have non-negative integer coordinates. Moreover, if some point (x, y) belongs to the set, then all points (x', y'), such that 0 ≤ x' ≤ x and 0 ≤ y' ≤ y also belong to this set.

Now Wilbur wants to number the points in the set he has, that is assign them distinct integer numbers from 1 to n. In order to make the numbering aesthetically pleasing, Wilbur imposes the condition that if some point (x, y) gets number i, then all (x',y') from the set, such that x' ≥ x and y' ≥ y must be assigned a number not less than i. For example, for a set of four points (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0) and (1, 1), there are two aesthetically pleasing numberings. One is 1, 2, 3, 4 and another one is 1, 3, 2, 4.

Wilbur's friend comes along and challenges Wilbur. For any point he defines it's special value as s(x, y) = y - x. Now he gives Wilbur some w1, w2,..., wn, and asks him to find an aesthetically pleasing numbering of the points in the set, such that the point that gets number i has it's special value equal to wi, that is s(xi, yi) = yi - xi = wi.

Now Wilbur asks you to help him with this challenge.

Input

The first line of the input consists of a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of points in the set Wilbur is playing with.

Next follow n lines with points descriptions. Each line contains two integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100 000), that give one point in Wilbur's set. It's guaranteed that all points are distinct. Also, it is guaranteed that if some point (x, y) is present in the input, then all points (x', y'), such that 0 ≤ x' ≤ x and 0 ≤ y' ≤ y, are also present in the input.

The last line of the input contains n integers. The i-th of them is wi ( - 100 000 ≤ wi ≤ 100 000) — the required special value of the point that gets number i in any aesthetically pleasing numbering.

Output

If there exists an aesthetically pleasant numbering of points in the set, such that s(xi, yi) = yi - xi = wi, then print "YES" on the first line of the output. Otherwise, print "NO".

If a solution exists, proceed output with n lines. On the i-th of these lines print the point of the set that gets number i. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Examples

Input

5
2 0
0 0
1 0
1 1
0 1
0 -1 -2 1 0


Output

YES
0 0
1 0
2 0
0 1
1 1


Input

3
1 0
0 0
2 0
0 1 2


Output

NO

Note

In the first sample, point (2, 0) gets number 3, point (0, 0) gets number one, point (1, 0) gets number 2, point (1, 1) gets number 5 and point (0, 1) gets number 4. One can easily check that this numbering is aesthetically pleasing and yi - xi = wi.

In the second sample, the special values of the points in the set are 0,  - 1, and  - 2 while the sequence that the friend gives to Wilbur is 0, 1, 2. Therefore, the answer does not exist.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin
from collections import *

rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
(n, labels) = (int(input()), [[0 for _ in range(1000)] for _ in range(1000)])
(a, w) = ([rints() for _ in range(n)], rints())
func_1()

def func_1():
    (mem, mem2, out) = (Counter(w), defaultdict(list), [])
    for (x, y) in a:
        mem2[y - x].append([x, y])
    for (i, j) in mem.items():
        if len(mem2[i]) != j:
            print('NO')
            exit()
        mem2[i].sort(reverse=True)
    for i in range(n):
        (x, y) = mem2[w[i]][-1]
        labels[x][y] = i + 1
        if i and labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y] or labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y]:
            print('NO')
            exit()
        out.append(' '.join(map(str, mem2[w[i]].pop())))
    print('YES')
    print('\n'.join(out))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
