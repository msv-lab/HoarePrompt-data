Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the aesthetic condition is satisfied for all points. 

Consider the following counterexample:

Input:
```
4
1 0
0 0
2 0
0 1
1 0 -1 1
```

Expected output:
```
YES
0 0
1 0
2 0
0 1
```

However, the program fails to produce the correct output. Let's analyze why:

1. The points are processed and sorted by their special value \( y - x \).
2. For \( w = [1, 0, -1, 1] \):
   - Point (1, 0) with \( w[0] = 1 \) should get number 1.
   - Point (0, 0) with \( w[1] = 0 \) should get number 2.
   - Point (2, 0) with \( w[2] = -1 \) should get number 3.
   - Point (0, 1) with \( w[3] = 1 \) should get number 4.

But when the program tries to assign numbers, it does not correctly check the aesthetic condition for all points. Specifically, the program does not ensure that all points (x', y') with \( x' \geq x \) and \( y' \geq y \) get numbers not less than the assigned number. 

For instance, after assigning:
- (0, 0) gets number 2,
- (1, 0) gets number 1,
- (2, 0) gets number 3,
- (0, 1) gets number 4,

the program should verify that all points (x', y') with \( x' \geq x \) and \( y' \geq y \) have numbers not less than the assigned number. However, the program does not perform this verification step, leading to potential violations of the aesthetic condition.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the requirement and thus is incorrect.
