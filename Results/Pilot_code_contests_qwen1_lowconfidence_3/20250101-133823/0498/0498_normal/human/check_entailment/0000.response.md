Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the special values \(w_i\) do not allow for an aesthetically pleasing numbering of the points. Specifically, the program does not check if there is a valid way to assign the points based on the given special values before attempting to assign them. 

For instance, consider the following input:

```
5
2 0
0 0
1 0
1 1
0 1
0 -1 -2 1 0
```

This input matches the conditions described in the problem statement. However, the program will attempt to assign the points based on the given special values without verifying if such an assignment is possible. In this case, it would correctly assign the points as:

```
0 0
1 0
2 0
0 1
1 1
```

But consider another set of special values:

```
3
1 0
0 0
2 0
0 1 2
```

Here, the special values are \(0, -1, -2\), which do not allow for an aesthetically pleasing numbering of the points. The program will still attempt to assign the points based on these special values, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program does not correctly validate the feasibility of the special values before proceeding with the assignment.
