Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the code does not ensure that the points are numbered in an aesthetically pleasing manner according to the given constraints. Here are some issues:

1. **Label Assignment Logic**: The code attempts to assign labels to points based on the weights but does not properly validate the aesthetic condition. The aesthetic condition requires that for any point \((x, y)\) labeled \(i\), all points \((x', y')\) such that \(x' \geq x\) and \(y' \geq y\) must be assigned a number not less than \(i\).

2. **Reverse Sorting Issue**: The code sorts the points in reverse order based on their special values \(y - x\), but it does not ensure that the labels are assigned correctly to maintain the aesthetic condition.

3. **Boundary Checks**: The code does not properly check the boundary conditions and ensure that the labels are assigned in a way that satisfies the aesthetic condition. For example, if a point \((x, y)\) is labeled \(i\) and there is a point \((x+1, y)\) or \((x, y+1)\) with a lower label, the aesthetic condition is violated.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

### Counterexample
Consider the following input:
```
5
2 0
0 0
1 0
1 1
0 1
0 -1 -2 1 0
```

The correct aesthetically pleasing numbering should be:
- Point \((2, 0)\) gets number 3
- Point \((0, 0)\) gets number 1
- Point \((1, 0)\) gets number 2
- Point \((1, 1)\) gets number 5
- Point \((0, 1)\) gets number 4

However, the provided code fails to produce this output correctly due to the labeling logic not properly enforcing the aesthetic condition.

To fix the code, you would need to implement a more robust labeling algorithm that ensures the aesthetic condition is met for all points. This involves maintaining a priority queue or similar data structure to ensure that labels are assigned correctly based on the given constraints.
