You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Wilbur is playing with a set of n points on the coordinate plane. All points have non-negative integer coordinates. Moreover, if some point (x, y) belongs to the set, then all points (x', y'), such that 0 ≤ x' ≤ x and 0 ≤ y' ≤ y also belong to this set.

Now Wilbur wants to number the points in the set he has, that is assign them distinct integer numbers from 1 to n. In order to make the numbering aesthetically pleasing, Wilbur imposes the condition that if some point (x, y) gets number i, then all (x',y') from the set, such that x' ≥ x and y' ≥ y must be assigned a number not less than i. For example, for a set of four points (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0) and (1, 1), there are two aesthetically pleasing numberings. One is 1, 2, 3, 4 and another one is 1, 3, 2, 4.

Wilbur's friend comes along and challenges Wilbur. For any point he defines it's special value as s(x, y) = y - x. Now he gives Wilbur some w1, w2,..., wn, and asks him to find an aesthetically pleasing numbering of the points in the set, such that the point that gets number i has it's special value equal to wi, that is s(xi, yi) = yi - xi = wi.

Now Wilbur asks you to help him with this challenge.

Input

The first line of the input consists of a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of points in the set Wilbur is playing with.

Next follow n lines with points descriptions. Each line contains two integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100 000), that give one point in Wilbur's set. It's guaranteed that all points are distinct. Also, it is guaranteed that if some point (x, y) is present in the input, then all points (x', y'), such that 0 ≤ x' ≤ x and 0 ≤ y' ≤ y, are also present in the input.

The last line of the input contains n integers. The i-th of them is wi ( - 100 000 ≤ wi ≤ 100 000) — the required special value of the point that gets number i in any aesthetically pleasing numbering.

Output

If there exists an aesthetically pleasant numbering of points in the set, such that s(xi, yi) = yi - xi = wi, then print "YES" on the first line of the output. Otherwise, print "NO".

If a solution exists, proceed output with n lines. On the i-th of these lines print the point of the set that gets number i. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Examples

Input

5
2 0
0 0
1 0
1 1
0 1
0 -1 -2 1 0


Output

YES
0 0
1 0
2 0
0 1
1 1


Input

3
1 0
0 0
2 0
0 1 2


Output

NO

Note

In the first sample, point (2, 0) gets number 3, point (0, 0) gets number one, point (1, 0) gets number 2, point (1, 1) gets number 5 and point (0, 1) gets number 4. One can easily check that this numbering is aesthetically pleasing and yi - xi = wi.

In the second sample, the special values of the points in the set are 0,  - 1, and  - 2 while the sequence that the friend gives to Wilbur is 0, 1, 2. Therefore, the answer does not exist.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin
from collections import *

rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
(n, labels) = (int(input()), [[0 for _ in range(1000)] for _ in range(1000)])
(a, w) = ([rints() for _ in range(n)], rints())
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000. The input consists of n lines, where each line contains two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100 000, representing points in the set. It is guaranteed that all points are distinct and if some point (x, y) is present, then all points (x', y'), such that 0 ≤ x' ≤ x and 0 ≤ y' ≤ y, are also present. The last line of the input contains n integers wi such that -100 000 ≤ wi ≤ 100 000, representing the required special values for the points.
def func_1():
    mem, mem2, out = Counter(w), defaultdict(list), []
    for (x, y) in a:
        mem2[y - x].append([x, y])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where for every pair \((x, y)\) in `a`, \([x, y]\) is appended to `mem2[y - x]` exactly once, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair \((x, y)\)
    for (i, j) in mem.items():
        if len(mem2[i]) != j:
            print('NO')
            exit()
        
        mem2[i].sort(reverse=True)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq total \leq 100,000\), `mem` must contain at least one key-value pair, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where for every key `i` in `mem`, `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair \((x, y)\).
    for i in range(n):
        x, y = mem2[w[i]][-1]
        
        labels[x][y] = i + 1
        
        if i and labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y] or labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y]:
            print('NO')
            exit()
        
        out.append(' '.join(map(str, mem2[w[i]].pop())))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `out` is a list of string representations of elements removed from `mem2[w[i]]` for each iteration, `mem2[w[i]]` is empty, `labels[x][y]` is populated based on the removed elements, and if the loop completes without exiting, no condition `labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y]` or `labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y]` is violated.
    print('YES')
    print('\n'.join(out))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of points \((x, y)\) and their corresponding weights \(w_i\). It checks if the points form a valid grid where each cell \((x, y)\) is assigned a unique label based on the weights of the points that cover it. If the points and weights satisfy certain conditions, it outputs "YES" followed by the labels of the points. Otherwise, it outputs "NO". The function ensures that the labels are consistent with the given weights and the grid structure. If any inconsistency is found, it exits early with "NO".
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
