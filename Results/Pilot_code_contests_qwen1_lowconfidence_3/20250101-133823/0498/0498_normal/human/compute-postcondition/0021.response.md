The `exit()` function is called, which immediately terminates the program without executing any further code. This means that none of the variables are modified, and the program exits abruptly.

Output State: **`total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq total \leq 100,000\), `mem` must contain at least one key-value pair, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair \((x, y)\)**
