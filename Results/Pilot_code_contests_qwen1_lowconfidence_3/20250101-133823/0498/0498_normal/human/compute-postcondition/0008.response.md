To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions required for the loop to run based on the given information:

1. **`total`**: The value of `total` itself does not directly impact whether the loop can execute, as it is not referenced within the loop itself. Therefore, no change is needed for `total`.

2. **`mem`**: `mem` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `w`. For the loop to execute, `mem` must contain at least one key-value pair because the loop iterates over items in `mem`. If `mem` were empty, the loop would not execute.

3. **`mem2`**: This is a defaultdict of lists. Its presence and contents do not affect the loop directly since it only accesses `mem` during the loop iterations.

4. **`out`**: This is an empty list and does not affect the loop's execution.

5. **`a`**: The variable `a` is mentioned to be a non-empty list containing at least one pair \((x, y)\). However, the loop itself does not directly access or use `a` or its contents; it only uses `mem`.

Given these points, the critical condition for the loop to execute is that `mem` must contain at least one key-value pair.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
- If `mem` is empty, the loop will not execute.
- To ensure the loop executes, `mem` must have at least one item.

Therefore, the state that needs adjustment is ensuring `mem` contains at least one key-value pair.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mem` must contain at least one key-value pair, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair \((x, y)\)**
