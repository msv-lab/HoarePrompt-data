The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console. This operation does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the only change is the output of the program.

Output State: **`out` is updated with the smallest element of `mem2[w[i+1]]`, `mem2[w[i+1]]` is unchanged, `x` is the last element of `mem2[w[i]]`, `y` is the last element of `mem2[w[i]]`, `mem2[w[i]]` has its last element removed, `x` and `y` are the new smallest elements in `mem2[w[i+1]]` (unchanged), `labels[x][y]` is updated to `i + 1`, the program prints 'NO'**
