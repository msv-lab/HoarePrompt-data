Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is given as:
   - `out` is updated with the smallest element of `mem2[w[i+1]]`, `mem2[w[i+1]]` remains unchanged.
   - `x` and `y` are the new smallest elements in `mem2[w[i+1]]`.
   - `mem2[w[i]]` has its last element removed.
   - `labels[x][y]` is updated to `i + 1`.
   - If `i` is not zero and either `labels[x + 1][y]` is less than `labels[x][y]` or `labels[x][y + 1]` is less than `labels[x][y]`, the program exits and prints 'NO'. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   out.append(' '.join(map(str, mem2[w[i]].pop())))
   ```

3. Let's analyze the impact of this code:
   - `mem2[w[i]]` has its last element removed. This means the last element of the list `mem2[w[i]]` is popped off and discarded.
   - The popped element is converted to a string using `map(str, ...)` and then joined into a single string with spaces between elements using `' '.join(...)`.
   - This resulting string is appended to the list `out`.

4. After executing this line of code, the following changes occur:
   - The last element of `mem2[w[i]]` is removed.
   - A string representing the remaining elements of `mem2[w[i]]` (after removing the last element) is added to `out`.

Given these points, the output state will be:

- `mem2[w[i]]` now has one less element than before.
- The last element of `mem2[w[i]]` is no longer present.
- `out` now contains the string representation of the remaining elements of `mem2[w[i]]` that were just removed.

Output State: **`out` now contains the string representation of the remaining elements of `mem2[w[i]]` (after removing the last element), `mem2[w[i]]` has one less element, `x` and `y` are the new smallest elements in `mem2[w[i+1]]`, `mem2[w[i+1]]` remains unchanged, `labels[x][y]` is updated to `i + 1`. If `i` is not zero and either `labels[x + 1][y]` is less than `labels[x][y]` or `labels[x][y + 1]` is less than `labels[x][y]`, the program has exited and printed 'NO'. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.**
