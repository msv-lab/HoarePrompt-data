The code snippet removes the smallest element from `mem2[w[i]]` and appends it to `out` as a string. The values of `w[i]`, `x`, `y`, and `labels[x][y]` are updated due to the removal of the smallest element.

- `mem2[w[i]]` is modified by removing its smallest element.
- `out` is updated by appending the removed element as a string.
- `x` and `y` are updated to be the next smallest elements in `mem2[w[i]]` since the smallest was just removed.
- `labels[x][y]` is updated based on the new smallest values.

Given these changes, the output state will be:

- `out` is updated with the smallest element of `mem2[w[i]]`.
- `mem2[w[i]]` is updated to remove its smallest element.
- `x` and `y` are updated to the new smallest elements in `mem2[w[i]]`.
- `labels[x][y]` is updated based on the new smallest values.

Since the exact values of `mem2[w[i]]`, `x`, `y`, and `labels[x][y]` are not specified, we can only describe the general impact. However, the specific values of `x` and `y` and the updated `labels[x][y]` depend on the current contents of `mem2[w[i]]`.

Output State: **`out` is updated with the smallest element of `mem2[w[i]]`, `mem2[w[i]]` is updated to remove its smallest element, `x` and `y` are updated to the new smallest elements in `mem2[w[i]]`, `labels[x][y]` is updated based on the new smallest values.**
