The code `print('NO')` does not affect any of the variables. It simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. The output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to the values of the variables.

Output State: **`total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq total \leq 100,000\), `mem` must contain at least one key-value pair, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair \((x, y)\)**
