The code `x, y = mem2[w[i]][-1]` has the following impacts:
1. It extracts the last element from `mem2[w[i]]` and assigns it to both `x` and `y`.
2. Since this is the last element, it is removed from `mem2[w[i]]`.

Given the initial state:
- `out` is updated with the smallest element of `mem2[w[i+1]]`.
- `mem2[w[i+1]]` is updated to remove its smallest element.
- `x` and `y` are updated to the new smallest elements in `mem2[w[i+1]]`.
- `labels[x][y]` is updated based on the new smallest values.

After executing the code:
- `x` and `y` are assigned the last element of `mem2[w[i]]`.
- The last element of `mem2[w[i]]` is removed.

The smallest elements in `mem2[w[i+1]]` might change, but since the code does not directly affect `mem2[w[i+1]]`, the initial state of `out` (smallest element of `mem2[w[i+1]]`) remains unchanged, and the smallest elements in `mem2[w[i+1]]` remain the same until further changes.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `out` is still updated with the smallest element of `mem2[w[i+1]]`.
- `mem2[w[i+1]]` remains the same.
- `x` is assigned the last element of `mem2[w[i]]`.
- `y` is assigned the last element of `mem2[w[i]]`.
- `mem2[w[i]]` has its last element removed.
- `x` and `y` are updated to the new smallest elements in `mem2[w[i+1]]` (unchanged).
- `labels[x][y]` is updated based on the new smallest values (unchanged).

Output State: **`out` is updated with the smallest element of `mem2[w[i+1]]`, `mem2[w[i+1]]` is unchanged, `x` is the last element of `mem2[w[i]]`, `y` is the last element of `mem2[w[i]]`, `mem2[w[i]]` has its last element removed, `x` and `y` are the new smallest elements in `mem2[w[i+1]]` (unchanged), `labels[x][y]` is updated based on the new smallest values (unchanged).**
