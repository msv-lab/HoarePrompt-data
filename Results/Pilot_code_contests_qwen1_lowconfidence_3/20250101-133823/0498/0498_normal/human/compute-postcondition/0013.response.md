The code sorts the list `mem2[i]` in descending order. The original state of `mem2[i]` is a list that may or may not be sorted, but after running the code, it will be sorted in reverse order. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq total \leq 100,000\), `mem` must contain at least one key-value pair, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair \((x, y)\).**
