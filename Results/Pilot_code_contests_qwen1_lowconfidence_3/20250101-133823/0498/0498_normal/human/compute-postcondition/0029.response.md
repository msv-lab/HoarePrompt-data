The code prints 'NO', which does not affect any variable values. The conditions for `x`, `y`, and `labels` remain unchanged. The only thing that changes is the output of the program.

Output State: **`total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq total \leq 100,000\), `mem` contains at least one key-value pair, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where for every key `i` in `mem`, `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair \((x, y)\), `n` is a positive integer, `x` is the smallest value in `mem2[w[i]]`, `y` is the smallest value in `mem2[w[i]]`, `labels[x][y]` is assigned the value `i + 1`, and the if condition is satisfied because either \(i\) and `labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y]` or `labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y]` holds true; the program prints 'NO'**
