The code assigns the last element of `mem2[w[i]]` to `x` and removes it from `mem2[w[i]]`. The value of `y` is not specified in the initial state, so we assume it to be the second-to-last element of `mem2[w[i]]` before the removal. After the assignment, `x` will be the last element of `mem2[w[i]]` before the operation, and `y` will be the second-to-last element.

The output state is:

Output State: **`out` now contains the string representation of the remaining elements of `mem2[w[i + 1]]` (after removing the last element), `mem2[w[i + 1]]` has one less element, `x` is the last element of `mem2[w[i]]` before the removal, `y` is the second-to-last element of `mem2[w[i]]` before the removal, `mem2[w[i + 2]]` remains unchanged, `labels[x][y]` is updated to `i + 2`.**
