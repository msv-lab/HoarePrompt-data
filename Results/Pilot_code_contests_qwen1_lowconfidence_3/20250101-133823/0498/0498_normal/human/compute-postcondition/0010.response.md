The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. This operation does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq total \leq 100,000\), `mem` must contain at least one key-value pair, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair \((x, y)\), and the length of `mem2[i]` is not equal to `j`. A string 'NO' was printed to the console.**
