Postcondition: ***`out` is updated with the smallest element of `mem2[w[i+1]]`, `mem2[w[i+1]]` remains unchanged, `x` and `y` are the new smallest elements in `mem2[w[i+1]]`, `mem2[w[i]]` has its last element removed, `labels[x][y]` is updated to `i + 1`. If `i` is not zero and either `labels[x + 1][y]` is less than `labels[x][y]` or `labels[x][y + 1]` is less than `labels[x][y]`, the program has exited and printed 'NO'. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
