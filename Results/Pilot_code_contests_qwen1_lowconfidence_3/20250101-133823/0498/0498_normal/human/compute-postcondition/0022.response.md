Postcondition: ***`total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq total \leq 100,000\), `mem` must contain at least one key-value pair, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair \((x, y)\). If `len(mem2[i]) != j`, the condition is met as is. Otherwise, no specific change is applied since there is no else part in the code.***
