The code appends the list `[x, y]` to the list `mem2[y - x]`. This means that for every pair \((x, y)\) in `a`, the list `[x, y]` is added to `mem2[y - x]`.

Given the initial state:
- `total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\)
- `mem` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `w`
- `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where for every pair \((x, y)\) in `a`, `[x, y]` is appended to `mem2[y - x]` with an additional `[x, y]` added to `mem2[y - x]`
- `out` is an empty list
- `a` must contain at least one pair \((x, y)\)

After executing the line `mem2[y - x].append([x, y])`, the list `mem2[y - x]` will have one more instance of `[x, y]` appended to it.

Output State: **`total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\); `mem` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `w`; `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where for every pair \((x, y)\) in `a`, there is one additional `[x, y]` appended to `mem2[y - x]`; `out` is an empty list; `a` must contain at least one pair \((x, y)`**
