Postcondition: ***`out` now contains the string representation of the remaining elements of `mem2[w[i + 1]]` (after removing the last element), `mem2[w[i + 1]]` has one less element, `x` is the last element of `mem2[w[i]]` before the removal, `y` is the second-to-last element of `mem2[w[i]]` before the removal, `mem2[w[i + 2]]` remains unchanged, `labels[x][y]` is now `i + 1`. If the condition `i and labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y] or labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y]` is true, the program prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, nothing changes.***
