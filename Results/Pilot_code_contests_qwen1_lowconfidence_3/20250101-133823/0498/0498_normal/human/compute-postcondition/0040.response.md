Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `out` contains the string representation of the remaining elements of `mem2[w[i]]` (after removing the last element).
   - `mem2[w[i]]` has one less element.
   - `x` and `y` are the new smallest elements in `mem2[w[i+1]]`.
   - `mem2[w[i+1]]` remains unchanged.
   - `labels[x][y]` is updated to `i + 1`.
   - The condition `i != 0` and either `labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y]` or `labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y]` leads to the program exiting and printing 'NO'.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning it starts from `i = 0` and goes up to `i = n-1`.

3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, if the loop is to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `i + 1` (the next value in the range).
   - `mem2[w[i]]` should now have one less element since the previous iteration removed an element.
   - `x` and `y` are the new smallest elements in `mem2[w[i+1]]`, so we need to determine their values for the next iteration.
   - `labels[x][y]` is updated to `i + 1` at the end of each iteration, so this needs to be updated accordingly.

Given the above, let's adjust the states:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `mem2[w[i]]` will have one less element.
- `x` and `y` will be the new smallest elements in `mem2[w[i+1]]`.

State: **`out` now contains the string representation of the remaining elements of `mem2[w[i]]` (after removing the last element), `mem2[w[i]]` has one less element, `x` and `y` are the new smallest elements in `mem2[w[i+1]]`, `mem2[w[i+1]]` remains unchanged, `labels[x][y]` is updated to `i + 1`.**

So, the final state for the next iteration would be:

State: **`out` now contains the string representation of the remaining elements of `mem2[w[i + 1]]` (after removing the last element), `mem2[w[i + 1]]` has one less element, `x` and `y` are the new smallest elements in `mem2[w[i + 2]]`, `mem2[w[i + 2]]` remains unchanged, `labels[x][y]` is updated to `i + 2`.**
