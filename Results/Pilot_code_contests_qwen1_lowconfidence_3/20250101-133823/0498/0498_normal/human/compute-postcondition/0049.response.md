The code `print('\n'.join(out))` will join all the elements in the list `out` with a newline character and print them to the console. Since `out` contains string representations of elements removed from `mem2[w[i]]` for each iteration, the contents of `out` remain unchanged. The `mem2[w[i]]` is empty, and the `labels[x][y]` is populated based on the removed elements, which also remains unchanged. The condition for printing 'YES' is met, but it is printed to the console and does not affect the variables.

Output State: **`out` is a list of string representations of elements removed from `mem2[w[i]]` for each iteration, `mem2[w[i]]` is empty, `labels[x][y]` is populated based on the removed elements, and 'YES' is printed to the console.**
