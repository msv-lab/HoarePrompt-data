`labels[x][y]` is assigned the value `i + 1`. The value of `i + 1` is the new value of `labels[x][y]`, while the other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`out` now contains the string representation of the remaining elements of `mem2[w[i + 1]]` (after removing the last element), `mem2[w[i + 1]]` has one less element, `x` is the last element of `mem2[w[i]]` before the removal, `y` is the second-to-last element of `mem2[w[i]]` before the removal, `mem2[w[i + 2]]` remains unchanged, `labels[x][y]` is now `i + 1`.**
