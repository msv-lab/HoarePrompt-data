The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. Since the program is terminated, no further operations are performed, and the states of all variables remain unchanged. The string 'NO' was already printed to the console before the exit call.

Output State: **`total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq total \leq 100,000\), `mem` must contain at least one key-value pair, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair \((x, y)\), and the length of `mem2[i]` is not equal to `j`. The string 'NO' was printed to the console.**
