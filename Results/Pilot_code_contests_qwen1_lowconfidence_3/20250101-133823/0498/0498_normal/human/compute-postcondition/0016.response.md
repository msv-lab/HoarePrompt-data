The `exit()` function is used to terminate the program immediately without executing any further code. Since no further operations are performed after this function call, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq total \leq 100,000\), `mem` must contain at least one key-value pair, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair \((x, y)\)**
