The code `exit()` is used to terminate the program immediately. This means that no further code execution will take place after this statement. Based on the given initial state, we know the following:

- `out` is updated with the smallest element of `mem2[w[i+1]]`.
- `mem2[w[i+1]]` remains unchanged.
- `x` and `y` are the last elements of `mem2[w[i]]` before it was modified.
- `x` and `y` are now the new smallest elements in `mem2[w[i+1]]`.
- `labels[x][y]` is updated to `i + 1`.
- The program prints 'NO'.

Since the program terminates immediately after printing 'NO', none of the variables are further affected. The output state includes the information that the program has exited and printed 'NO'.

Output State: **the program has exited and printed 'NO'**
