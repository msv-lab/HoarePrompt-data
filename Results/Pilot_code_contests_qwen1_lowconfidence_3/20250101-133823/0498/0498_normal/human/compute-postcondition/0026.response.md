The code `x, y = mem2[w[i]][-1]` extracts the last element from the list associated with the key `w[i]` in `mem2` and assigns it to `x` and `y`. Since `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists and the lists are sorted in descending order, the last element will be the smallest element in the list.

Given that `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order, the last element (i.e., `mem2[w[i]][-1]`) is the smallest value in the list for the key `w[i]`.

The initial states include:
- `total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq total \leq 100,000\).
- `mem` must contain at least one key-value pair.
- `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where for every key `i` in `mem`, `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair \((x, y)\).
- `n` must be a positive integer.

After executing the line of code, the values of `x` and `y` are updated to the last (smallest) element in the list corresponding to the key `w[i]` in `mem2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq total \leq 100,000\), `mem` contains at least one key-value pair, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where for every key `i` in `mem`, `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair \((x, y)\), `n` is a positive integer, `x` is the smallest value in `mem2[w[i]]`, `y` is the smallest value in `mem2[w[i]]`.**
