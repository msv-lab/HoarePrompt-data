The code appends a list `[x, y]` to the list `mem2[y - x]`. The variables `mem`, `out`, and `total` are not affected by this line of code.

Given that `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair `(x, y)`, this means there is at least one element in `a` that is a tuple with two elements. For each such tuple `(x, y)` in `a`, the code will append `[x, y]` to `mem2[y - x]`.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact contents of `a`, we cannot determine the exact content of `mem2[y - x]`. However, we know that for every pair `(x, y)` in `a`, a new entry will be added to `mem2[y - x]`.

Output State: **`total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where for every pair (x, y) in `a`, `[x, y]` is appended to `mem2[y - x]`, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair `(x, y)`**.
