To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the initial conditions and how they change within the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
   - `mem` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `w`.
   - `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where for every pair \((x, y)\) in `a`, `[x, y]` is appended to `mem2[y - x]` with an additional `[x, y]` added to `mem2[y - x]`.
   - `out` is an empty list.
   - `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair \((x, y)\).

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each pair \((x, y)\) in the list `a`.
   - Within the loop, some operations are performed, but the specific details of these operations are omitted.

3. **State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we assume that the loop has processed one pair \((x, y)\) from the list `a`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - The list `a` has at least one pair, and since one pair has already been processed, there are still pairs left in `a` for the next iteration.
   - `total` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `mem` and `mem2` may have been updated based on the processing of the current pair, but the specific updates are not provided.
   - `out` remains an empty list as it is not mentioned to be modified within the loop.
   - `a` now contains all pairs except the one just processed.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute one more time, the key adjustment needed is that there should be at least one pair remaining in the list `a`.

### Final State:
State: **`total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\); `mem` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `w`; `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where for every pair \((x, y)\) in `a`, `[x, y]` is appended to `mem2[y - x]` with an additional `[x, y]` added to `mem2[y - x]`; `out` is an empty list; `a` must contain at least one pair \((x, y)\)**
