Output State: **`out` is a list of string representations of elements removed from `mem2[w[i]]` for each iteration, `mem2[w[i]]` is empty, `labels[x][y]` is populated based on the removed elements, and if the loop completes without exiting, no condition `labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y]` or `labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y]` is violated.** 

Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs for `n` iterations, where `n` is the length of the list `w`. Each iteration removes the largest element (in terms of the pair `(x, y)`) from `mem2[w[i]]` and appends the string representation of this element to `out`.

2. **Variables After Loop Completion**:
   - **`out`**: This list accumulates the string representations of the elements removed from `mem2[w[i]]` during each iteration. Since the loop runs `n` times, `out` will contain `n` elements.
   - **`mem2[w[i]]`**: After all iterations, `mem2[w[i]]` becomes empty because each element is removed exactly once.
   - **`labels[x][y]`**: The `labels` matrix is updated during each iteration to reflect the order of removal of elements. Specifically, `labels[x][y]` is set to `i + 1` after the `i-th` iteration, indicating the order of removal.

3. **Exit Condition**:
   - If at any point the condition `labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y]` or `labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y]` is met, the program prints 'NO' and exits. Therefore, if the loop completes without printing 'NO', none of these conditions hold true.

4. **Initial Values**:
   - **`total`**: Remains unchanged as it is not used within the loop.
   - **`mem`**: Its value is not explicitly stated to change within the loop, so it retains its original state.
   - **`a`**: The list `a` is not referenced within the loop, so it retains its original state.

In summary, the final state of the variables after the loop completes without exiting is described above.
