The code `mem2[y - x].append([x, y])` impacts the `mem2` dictionary by appending the list `[x, y]` to the list associated with the key `y - x`. The `total` variable, `mem` Counter object, `out` list, and the list `a` are not affected.

Given the initial state:
- `total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\)
- `mem` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `w`
- `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where for every pair \((x, y)\) in `a`, `[x, y]` is appended to `mem2[y - x]`
- `out` is an empty list
- `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair \((x, y)\)

After executing the code, `mem2` will have its entry for the key `y - x` updated to include the list `[x, y]`.

Output State: **`total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\); `mem` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `w`; `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where for every pair \((x, y)\) in `a`, `[x, y]` is appended to `mem2[y - x]` with an additional `[x, y]` added to `mem2[y - x]`; `out` is an empty list; `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair \((x, y)\)**
