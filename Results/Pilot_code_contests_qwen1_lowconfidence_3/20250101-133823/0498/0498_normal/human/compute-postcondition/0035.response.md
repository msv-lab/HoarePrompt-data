The code `labels[x][y] = i + 1` updates the value of `labels[x][y]` to `i + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`out` is updated with the smallest element of `mem2[w[i+1]]`, `mem2[w[i+1]]` is unchanged, `x` is the last element of `mem2[w[i]]`, `y` is the last element of `mem2[w[i]]`, `mem2[w[i]]` has its last element removed, `x` and `y` are the new smallest elements in `mem2[w[i+1]]` (unchanged), `labels[x][y]` is updated to `i + 1`.**
