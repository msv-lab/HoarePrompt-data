The code `out.append(' '.join(map(str, mem2[w[i]].pop())))` impacts the following variables:
- `mem2[w[i]]` is modified by popping its last element.
- `out` is appended with a string representation of the popped elements.

Given the initial state:
- `out` now contains the string representation of the remaining elements of `mem2[w[i + 1]]` (after removing the last element).
- `mem2[w[i + 1]]` has one less element.
- `x` is the last element of `mem2[w[i]]` before the removal.
- `y` is the second-to-last element of `mem2[w[i]]` before the removal.
- `mem2[w[i + 2]]` remains unchanged.
- `labels[x][y]` is now `i + 1`.

After executing the code, the last element of `mem2[w[i]]` is removed, and its string representation is appended to `out`. Since `x` was the last element and `y` was the second-to-last, after the pop operation, `x` is no longer the last element, and `y` is now the last element of `mem2[w[i]]`.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `out` is updated to include the string representation of the elements of `mem2[w[i]]` after the pop.
- `mem2[w[i]]` is updated to remove its last element.
- `mem2[w[i + 1]]` has one less element.
- `mem2[w[i + 2]]` remains unchanged.
- `labels[x][y]` remains `i + 1`.

Output State: **`out` now contains the string representation of the remaining elements of `mem2[w[i]]` (after removing the last element), `mem2[w[i]]` has one less element, `mem2[w[i + 1]]` has one less element, `mem2[w[i + 2]]` remains unchanged, `labels[x][y]` is `i + 1`.**
