The code sorts the list `mem2[i]` in descending order. This means that the values within the list `mem2[i]` are rearranged to be in descending order, but the structure and other contents of the dictionary `mem2` remain unchanged. The other variables (`total`, `mem`, `out`, and `a`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq total \leq 100,000\), `mem` must contain at least one key-value pair, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where `mem2[i]` is now sorted in descending order, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair \((x, y)\)**.
