The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. As a result, no further code in the current context will be executed, and no new variables will be assigned values. However, the print statement that outputs 'NO' will still be processed before the program exits.

Therefore, the only updates to the state are related to the print statement execution and the termination of the program.

Output State: **`out` now contains the string representation of the remaining elements of `mem2[w[i + 1]]` (after removing the last element), `mem2[w[i + 1]]` has one less element, `x` is the last element of `mem2[w[i]]` before the removal, `y` is the second-to-last element of `mem2[w[i]]` before the removal, `mem2[w[i + 2]]` remains unchanged, `labels[x][y]` is now `i + 1`, the program prints 'NO', and the program exits.**
