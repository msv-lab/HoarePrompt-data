Output State: **`total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where for every pair \((x, y)\) in `a`, \([x, y]\) is appended to `mem2[y - x]` exactly once, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair \((x, y)\)**

### Explanation:

- **`total`**: The value of `total` remains unchanged throughout the loop since it is not used or modified within the loop. It is initialized as an integer between 1 and 100,000 and stays constant.
  
- **`mem`**: This is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of elements in the list `w`. It remains unchanged as the loop does not modify `mem`.

- **`mem2`**: For each pair \((x, y)\) in the list `a`, the loop appends \([x, y]\) to `mem2[y - x]`. Since the loop runs for each element in `a`, every \([x, y]\) will be appended to `mem2[y - x]` exactly once. Therefore, `mem2` contains all pairs \([x, y]\) grouped by their difference \(y - x\).

- **`out`**: The list `out` remains empty as no operations are performed on it within the loop.

- **`a`**: The list `a` must contain at least one pair \((x, y)\) for the loop to execute at least once. If `a` is empty, the loop does not execute.

Since the loop appends each \([x, y]\) exactly once to `mem2[y - x]`, after all iterations, `mem2` will contain exactly those pairs. If the loop does not execute, the values of the variables remain as described in the initial state.
