The code `print('YES')` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply prints 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the only change is in the output printed to the console, but this does not alter the state of the variables.

Output State: **`out` is a list of string representations of elements removed from `mem2[w[i]]` for each iteration, `mem2[w[i]]` is empty, `labels[x][y]` is populated based on the removed elements, and if the loop completes without exiting, no condition `labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y]` or `labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y]` is violated. Printed to the console is 'YES'**
