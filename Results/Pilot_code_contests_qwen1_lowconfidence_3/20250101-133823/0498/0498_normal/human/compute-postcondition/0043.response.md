The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not affect any variable values or states. Therefore, the only changes are the output to the console, which is 'NO', and the preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`out` now contains the string representation of the remaining elements of `mem2[w[i + 1]]` (after removing the last element), `mem2[w[i + 1]]` has one less element, `x` is the last element of `mem2[w[i]]` before the removal, `y` is the second-to-last element of `mem2[w[i]]` before the removal, `mem2[w[i + 2]]` remains unchanged, `labels[x][y]` is now `i + 1`, print statement outputs 'NO'**
