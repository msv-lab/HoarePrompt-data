To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze how the variables change within the loop body and what conditions are required for the loop to continue.

Given the information at the end of the previous iteration:
- `out` is updated with the smallest element of `mem2[w[i]]`.
- `mem2[w[i]]` is updated to remove its smallest element.
- `x` and `y` are updated to the new smallest elements in `mem2[w[i]]`.
- `labels[x][y]` is updated based on the new smallest values.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must hold true at the start of the next iteration:
- The variable `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue.
- `mem2[w[i]]` must still contain elements after removing the smallest one.

Since the loop iterates over `range(n)`, the condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following changes have occurred:
- `mem2[w[i]]` has had its smallest element removed.
- `x` and `y` are now the smallest indices in `mem2[w[i]]`.
- `labels[x][y]` has been updated based on the new smallest values.

For the next iteration, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes `i+1`), and `mem2[w[i]]` still contains elements. Since `mem2[w[i]]` just had its smallest element removed, it still needs to have at least one element left for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `out` is updated with the smallest element of `mem2[w[i]]` (where `i` is incremented by 1).
- `mem2[w[i]]` is updated to remove its smallest element (after incrementing `i`).
- `x` and `y` are updated to the new smallest elements in `mem2[w[i]]` (after incrementing `i`).
- `labels[x][y]` is updated based on the new smallest values (after incrementing `i`).

State: **`out` is updated with the smallest element of `mem2[w[i+1]]`, `mem2[w[i+1]]` is updated to remove its smallest element, `x` and `y` are updated to the new smallest elements in `mem2[w[i+1]]`, `labels[x][y]` is updated based on the new smallest values**
