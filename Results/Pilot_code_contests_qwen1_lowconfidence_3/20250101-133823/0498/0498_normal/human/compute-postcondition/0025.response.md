Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variable and its range**: The loop is iterating over `range(n)`, meaning the loop will execute `n` times where `n` is some integer.

2. **Determine what `n` represents**: The value of `n` itself is not directly provided in the initial state. However, since the loop will execute based on `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is a positive integer. This is because if `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute at all.

3. **Initial states of other variables**:
   - `total`: Given as an integer such that \(1 \leq total \leq 100,000\).
   - `mem`: Must contain at least one key-value pair.
   - `mem2`: A defaultdict of lists where for every key `i` in `mem`, `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order.
   - `out`: An empty list.
   - `a`: A non-empty list containing at least one pair \((x, y)\).

4. **Adjustments needed for the loop to execute**:
   - Since `n` determines the number of iterations, `n` must be a positive integer.
   - No adjustments are necessary for `total`, `mem`, `mem2`, `out`, or `a` based on the provided information about their initial states.

Given these points, the required adjustment for the loop to execute is that `n` must be a positive integer.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq total \leq 100,000\), `mem` must contain at least one key-value pair, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where for every key `i` in `mem`, `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair \((x, y)\), `n` must be a positive integer**
