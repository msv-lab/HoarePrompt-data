Functionality: **The function processes a series of points \((x, y)\) and their corresponding weights \(w_i\). It checks if the points form a valid grid where each cell \((x, y)\) is assigned a unique label based on the weights of the points that cover it. If the points and weights satisfy certain conditions, it outputs "YES" followed by the labels of the points. Otherwise, it outputs "NO". The function ensures that the labels are consistent with the given weights and the grid structure. If any inconsistency is found, it exits early with "NO".**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If the input points do not form a valid grid as described (i.e., not all sub-points are present), the function will detect this and output "NO".
- If the weights violate the consistency requirement (i.e., labels \((x+1, y)\) or \((x, y+1)\) are less than \((x, y)\)), the function will output "NO".

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not explicitly check if all points and weights are within the specified bounds (1 ≤ \(n\) ≤ 100,000, 0 ≤ \(x, y\) ≤ 100,000, -100,000 ≤ \(w_i\) ≤ 100,000). However, these bounds are assumed to be enforced by the input constraints.
- There is no explicit handling for the case where the input does not contain enough points or weights to form a valid grid. If the input is invalid, the function will still attempt to process it, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input does not meet the assumptions.
