The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it processes an input consisting of multiple lines of data. Specifically, it reads an integer `n` which indicates the number of lines of data to follow. Each of these lines contains three integers: `x`, `y`, and `w_i`.

The function returns the sum of the `w_i` values for all points `(x, y)` where both `x` and `y` are positive.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to read a series of points and weights from the input, and return the sum of the weights `w_i` for all points `(x, y)` where both `x` and `y` are positive integers.

Functionality: **The function reads a series of points and weights from the input, and returns the sum of the weights \( w_i \) for all points \((x, y)\) where both \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers.**
