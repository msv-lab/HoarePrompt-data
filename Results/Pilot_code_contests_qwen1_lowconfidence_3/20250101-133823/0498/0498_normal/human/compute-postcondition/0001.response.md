To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
- `mem` is a `Counter` object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `w`.
- `mem2` is a `defaultdict` of lists.
- `out` is an empty list.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (x, y) in a:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop**: The loop iterates over pairs `(x, y)` from the list `a`. Therefore, the loop can only execute if `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair `(x, y)`.

2. **State Adjustments Needed**:
   - **List `a`**: For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one pair `(x, y)`. This means `a` should not be an empty list.
   - **Other Variables (`mem`, `mem2`, `out`)**: These variables are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute. They might be used within the loop body, but their current state doesn't affect the loop's ability to start executing.

### Conclusion:
The key variable that determines whether the loop can execute is `a`. Since `a` must contain at least one pair `(x, y)` for the loop to start, we need to adjust the state of `a`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of elements in the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair `(x, y)`**.
