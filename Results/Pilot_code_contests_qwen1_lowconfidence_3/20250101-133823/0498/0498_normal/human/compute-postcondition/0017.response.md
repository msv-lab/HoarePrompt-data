Postcondition: **`total` is an integer such that \(1 \leq total \leq 100,000\), `mem` must contain at least one key-value pair, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair \((x, y)\). If `len(mem2[i]) != j`, the condition holds as is. Since there is no else part provided, the postcondition does not change from the precondition.**
