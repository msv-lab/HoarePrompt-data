n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000. The input consists of n lines, where each line contains two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100 000, representing points in the set. It is guaranteed that all points are distinct and if some point (x, y) is present, then all points (x', y'), such that 0 ≤ x' ≤ x and 0 ≤ y' ≤ y, are also present. The last line of the input contains n integers wi such that -100 000 ≤ wi ≤ 100 000, representing the required special values for the points.
