The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list `matrix` of strings, where each string represents a row of a pixel picture consisting of "." and "#", and two positive integers `n` and `m` representing the number of rows and columns in the matrix. It then iterates over each column of the matrix to count the number of "#" and "." characters in each column. The function returns two lists: `black_cost` and `white_cost`, where `black_cost` contains the count of "#" characters in each column, and `white_cost` contains the count of "." characters in each column. This process effectively summarizes the distribution of pixels in terms of "#" and "." across all columns of the matrix. Potential edge cases include when the matrix is empty (i.e., `n` or `m` is 0), which would result in both `black_cost` and `white_cost` being empty lists. There is no missing functionality as described in the provided code.
