The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters:

- `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists of non-negative integers.
- `matrix` is a 2D list consisting of characters '.' and '#'.
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 1000.
- `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 1000 and x <= y.
- `black_cost` and `white_cost` are non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively.
- `index` is an integer such that 0 <= index < m.
- `w` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the width of the current group of pixels of the same color in the current column and the next column respectively.

The function has five possible return values based on the given cases:

- Case_1: The program returns 0.
- Case_2: The program returns 0.
- Case_3: The program returns float('inf').
- Case_4: The program returns the minimum value between `dp1[w][index]` and `dp2[b][index]`.
- Case_5: The program returns `min(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, where `c1` is the sum of `white_cost` from `index` to `index + cw - 1` plus `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)`, `c2` is `float('inf')`, `c3` is `float('inf')`, and `c4` is `black_cost[m] + func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, m + 1, 0, b + 1)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept specified parameters and return one of the following based on the conditions provided in the cases: 0, float('inf'), the minimum value between two elements in `dp1` and `dp2`, or a calculated minimum cost involving changes in pixel colors and recursive calls.
