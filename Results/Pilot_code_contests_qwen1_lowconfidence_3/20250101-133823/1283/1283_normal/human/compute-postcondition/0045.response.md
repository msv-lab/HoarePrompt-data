The code assigns the value of `index` to `i`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the value of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `dp1`, `dp2`, `matrix`, `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `black_cost`, `white_cost`, `w`, `b`, `cw`, and `cb` remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`c1` is the sum of `white_cost` from `index` to `index + cw - 1` plus `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)`, `c2` is `0`, `c3` is `float('inf')`, `c4` is `float('inf')`, `dp1` and `dp2` remain unchanged as 2D lists of non-negative integers, `matrix` remains unchanged as a 2D list consisting of characters '.' and '#', `n` and `m` remain positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1000\), `x` and `y` remain positive integers such that \(1 \leq x, y \leq 1000\) and \(x \leq y\), `black_cost` and `white_cost` remain non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively, `index` remains an integer such that \(0 \leq index < m\), `w` and `b` remain non-negative integers representing the width of the current group of pixels of the same color in the current column and the next column respectively, `cw` remains `w + cw - 1`, `i` is now `index`, and `b` is less than `x`; `cb` is equal to `b`.**
