`dp1[w][index]` is assigned the minimum value between `c1` and `c3`. Based on the initial state, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are defined as follows:

- `c1` is the sum of `white_cost` from `index` to `index + cw - 1` plus `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)`.
- `c2` remains `float('inf')`.
- `c3` remains `float('inf')`.
- `c4` is `black_cost[m] + func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, m + 1, 0, b + 1)`.

The values of `dp1`, `dp2`, `matrix`, `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `black_cost`, `white_cost`, `w`, `b`, `cw`, `i`, and `b` remain unchanged.

After executing the code, the updated value of `dp1[w][index]` is the minimum value between `c1` and `c3`.

Output State: **`c1` is the sum of `white_cost` from `index` to `index + cw - 1` plus `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)`, `c2` is `float('inf')`, `c3` is `float('inf')`, `c4` is `black_cost[m] + func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, m + 1, 0, b + 1)`, `dp1[w][index]` is the minimum value between `c1` and `c3`, `dp2` remains unchanged, `matrix` remains unchanged, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `x` and `y` remain unchanged, `black_cost` and `white_cost` remain unchanged, `w` and `b` remain unchanged, `cw` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, and `b` remains unchanged.**
