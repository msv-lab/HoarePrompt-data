The code `i = index` assigns the value of `index` to `i`. The value of `index` is an integer such that 0 <= index < m. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`c1` is 0, `c2` is `float('inf')`, `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists of non-negative integers, `matrix` is a 2D list consisting of characters '.' and '#', `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 1000, `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 1000 and x <= y, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively, `index` is an integer such that 0 <= index < m, `w` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the width of the current group of pixels of the same color in the current column and the next column respectively, and the index is less than m, `c3` is `float('inf')`, `c4` is `float('inf')`, `cw` equals `w`, and `i` equals `index`.**
