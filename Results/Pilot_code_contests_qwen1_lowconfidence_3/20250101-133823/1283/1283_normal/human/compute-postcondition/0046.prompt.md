You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for modifying the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed. You will be provided with the program state right before the loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the `while` loop statement. If it is a `while True` loop or if the loop can certainly execute one time, please simply repeat the program state right before the loop. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State right before the while loop: `total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer.
```
while i < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer. `n` beinng an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State right before the while loop: `total` is 0, students is 2 less than its initial value.
```
while students >=1 :
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable students.  If students is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute . Rigtht before the loop, students is 2 less than its initial value, So for the loop to  executed the first time time the initial value of students needed to have been equal or greater than 3 and students currently must be greater than 1.
State: **`total` is 0, students is 2 less than its initial value and students currently must be greater or equal to 1**


Your Task:
State right before the while loop: `c1` is the sum of `white_cost` from `index` to `index + cw - 1` plus `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)`, `c2` is `0`, `c3` is `float('inf')`, `c4` is `float('inf')`, `dp1` and `dp2` remain unchanged as 2D lists of non-negative integers, `matrix` remains unchanged as a 2D list consisting of characters '.' and '#', `n` and `m` remain positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1000\), `x` and `y` remain positive integers such that \(1 \leq x, y \leq 1000\) and \(x \leq y\), `black_cost` and `white_cost` remain non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively, `index` remains an integer such that \(0 \leq index < m\), `w` and `b` remain non-negative integers representing the width of the current group of pixels of the same color in the current column and the next column respectively, `cw` remains `w + cw - 1`, `i` is now `index`, and `b` is less than `x`; `cb` is equal to `b`.
```
while cb < x:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
