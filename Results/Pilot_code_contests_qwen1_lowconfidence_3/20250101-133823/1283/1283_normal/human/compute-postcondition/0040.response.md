The code updates `c1` by adding the result of `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)` to its current value. The other variables are not affected. Since the function `func_2` is called but its exact return value is not specified, we represent the new value of `c1` as `c1 + func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)`.

Output State: **`c1` is the sum of `white_cost` from index to `index + cw - 1` plus `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)`, `c2` is `float('inf')`, `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists of non-negative integers, `matrix` is a 2D list consisting of characters '.' and '#', `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1000\), `x` and `y` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x, y \leq 1000\) and \(x \leq y\), `black_cost` and `white_cost` are non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively, `index` is an integer such that \(0 \leq index < m\), `w` must be less than `x - cw + 1`, `b` is a non-negative integer representing the width of the current group of pixels of the same color in the next column, `c3` is `float('inf')`, `c4` is `float('inf')`, `cw` is `w + cw - 1`, `i` is `index + cw`, and the program breaks out of the loop.**
