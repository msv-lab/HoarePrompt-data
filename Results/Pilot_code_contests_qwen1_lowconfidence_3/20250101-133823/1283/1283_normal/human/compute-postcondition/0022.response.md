The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the `i == m` condition was checked. The values of the variables do not change due to this statement, but we break out of the loop or conditional block we were inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1` is 0, `c2` is `float('inf')`, `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists of non-negative integers, `matrix` is a 2D list consisting of characters '.' and '#', `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 1000, `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 1000 and x <= y, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively, `index` is an integer such that 0 <= index < m, `w` is less than `x`, `b` is a non-negative integer representing the width of the current group of pixels of the same color in the next column respectively, and `c3` is `float('inf')`, `c4` is `float('inf')`, `cw` equals `w`, and `i` equals `m`. We break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.
