Postcondition: ***`c1` is 0, `c2` is `float('inf')`, `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists of non-negative integers, `matrix` is a 2D list consisting of characters '.' and '#', `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 1000, `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 1000 and x <= y, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively, `index` is an integer such that 0 <= index < m, `w` is less than `x`, `b` is a non-negative integer representing the width of the current group of pixels of the same color in the next column respectively, `c3` is `float('inf')`, `c4` is `float('inf')`, `cw` equals `w`, `i` equals `m`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional block.***
