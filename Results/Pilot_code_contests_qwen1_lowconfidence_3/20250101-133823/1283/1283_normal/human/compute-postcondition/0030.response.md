`c1` is incremented by `white_cost[i]`. The value of `i` is updated to `m + 1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c1` is `0 + white_cost[i] + white_cost[m + 1]`, `c2` remains as `float('inf')`, `dp1` and `dp2` remain as 2D lists of non-negative integers, `matrix` remains as a 2D list consisting of characters '.' and '#', `n` and `m` remain as positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1000\), `x` and `y` remain as positive integers such that \(1 \leq x, y \leq 1000\) and \(x \leq y\), `black_cost` and `white_cost` remain as non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively, `index` remains as an integer such that \(0 \leq index < m\), `w` remains less than `x`, `b` remains as a non-negative integer representing the width of the current group of pixels of the same color in the next column, `c3` remains as `float('inf')`, `c4` remains as `float('inf')`, `cw` remains as `w + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
