The code snippet `c2 += black_cost[i]` increments `c2` by `black_cost[i]`. Given that `i` is now equal to `m`, we substitute `i` with `m` in the expression. Since `c2` was initially `float('inf')`, adding any non-negative integer (including `black_cost[m]`) to it will still result in `float('inf')` because `float('inf') + any_number = float('inf')`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`c1` is the sum of `white_cost` from `index` to `index + cw - 1` plus `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)`, `c2` is `float('inf')`, `c3` is `float('inf')`, `c4` is `float('inf')`, `dp1` and `dp2` remain unchanged as 2D lists of non-negative integers, `matrix` remains unchanged as a 2D list consisting of characters '.' and '#', `n` and `m` remain positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1000\), `x` and `y` remain positive integers such that \(1 \leq x, y \leq 1000\) and \(x \leq y\), `black_cost` and `white_cost` remain non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively, `index` is now equal to `m`, `w` and `b` remain non-negative integers representing the width of the current group of pixels of the same color in the current column and the next column respectively, `cw` remains `w + cw - 1`, `i` is now `m`, `b` is less than `x`, `cb` is initially set to `b + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
