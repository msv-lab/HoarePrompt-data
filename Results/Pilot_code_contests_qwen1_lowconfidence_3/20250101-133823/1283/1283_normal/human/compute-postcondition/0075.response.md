`c4` is assigned the value of `black_cost[index]` plus the result of `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, index + 1, 0, b + 1)`. The value of `index` is `m`, so `black_cost[index]` becomes `black_cost[m]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c1` is the sum of `white_cost` from `index` to `index + cw - 1` plus `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)`, `c2` remains `float('inf')`, `c3` remains `float('inf')`, `c4` is `black_cost[m] + func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, m + 1, 0, b + 1)`, `dp1` and `dp2` remain unchanged as 2D lists of non-negative integers, `matrix` remains unchanged as a 2D list consisting of characters '.' and '#', `n` and `m` remain positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1000\), `x` and `y` remain positive integers such that \(1 \leq x, y \leq 1000\) and \(x \leq y\), `black_cost` and `white_cost` remain non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively, `w` and `b` remain non-negative integers representing the width of the current group of pixels of the same color in the current column and the next column respectively, `cw` is `w + cw - 1`, `i` is `m + b + 1`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x` and `b + 1` is less than or equal to `y`.**
