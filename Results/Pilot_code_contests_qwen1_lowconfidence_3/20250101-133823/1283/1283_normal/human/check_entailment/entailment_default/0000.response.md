Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where `x > y`, which is a potential edge case that the problem description specifies. According to the problem description, the width of each monochrome vertical line must be at least `x` and at most `y`. The code does not enforce this constraint, which means it can lead to incorrect results when `x > y`. Additionally, the code does not explicitly validate that `w` and `b` are non-negative integers, although the input validation is assumed due to the problem constraints. However, the primary issue is the lack of handling the condition `x > y`, making the code incorrect for some potential cases.
