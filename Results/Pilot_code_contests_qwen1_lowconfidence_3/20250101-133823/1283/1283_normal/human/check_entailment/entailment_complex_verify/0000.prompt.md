You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You've got an n × m pixel picture. Each pixel can be white or black. Your task is to change the colors of as few pixels as possible to obtain a barcode picture.

A picture is a barcode if the following conditions are fulfilled: 

  * All pixels in each column are of the same color. 
  * The width of each monochrome vertical line is at least x and at most y pixels. In other words, if we group all neighbouring columns of the pixels with equal color, the size of each group can not be less than x or greater than y. 

Input

The first line contains four space-separated integers n, m, x and y (1 ≤ n, m, x, y ≤ 1000; x ≤ y).

Then follow n lines, describing the original image. Each of these lines contains exactly m characters. Character "." represents a white pixel and "#" represents a black pixel. The picture description doesn't have any other characters besides "." and "#".

Output

In the first line print the minimum number of pixels to repaint. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the binary search logic for determining the minimum number of pixels to repaint. Instead, it seems to be attempting to solve the problem using dynamic programming, but there are several issues:

1. **Function Definitions**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are defined, but they are not called within the main logic of the program. This suggests that the main logic is missing.

2. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The dynamic programming approach used in `func_2` is complex and may not correctly handle all cases. For example, the function does not properly ensure that the final result is the minimum cost required to transform the image into a barcode format. The logic for updating the DP tables (`dp1` and `dp2`) and the conditions for breaking out of the loop might not be fully correct.

3. **Base Cases and Final Cost Calculation**: The base cases and the final cost calculation in `func_2` are not clearly defined. The function does not correctly handle the boundary conditions for the DP tables and the final cost computation.

Given these issues, it is difficult to verify that the program will work correctly for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To verify the correctness, you would need to test the program with various edge cases, such as images with different sizes and configurations, and ensure that the output matches the expected results. Since we cannot definitively confirm the correctness through this analysis alone, the program is deemed incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

    #`The program returns black_cost and white_cost, where black_cost is a list of integers representing the count of '#' characters in each column of the matrix, and white_cost is a list of integers representing the count of '.' characters in each column of the matrix`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list `matrix` of strings, where each string represents a row of a pixel picture consisting of "." and "#", and two positive integers `n` and `m` representing the number of rows and columns in the matrix. It then iterates over each column of the matrix to count the number of "#" and "." characters in each column. The function returns two lists: `black_cost` and `white_cost`, where `black_cost` contains the count of "#" characters in each column, and `white_cost` contains the count of "." characters in each column. This process effectively summarizes the distribution of pixels in terms of "#" and "." across all columns of the matrix. Potential edge cases include when the matrix is empty (i.e., `n` or `m` is 0), which would result in both `black_cost` and `white_cost` being empty lists. There is no missing functionality as described in the provided code.

Otherwise, `c1` remains `c1`, `c2` is either the sum of `black_cost` from `m + 1` to `m + b + 1` plus `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, 0, cb)` if `b < x` or remains `float('inf')` otherwise, `c3` remains `c3`, `c4` remains `c4`, `dp1` and `dp2` remain unchanged, `matrix` remains unchanged, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `x` and `y` remain unchanged, `black_cost` and `white_cost` remain unchanged, `w` and `b` remain unchanged, `cw` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, and `b` is less than `x`.
        dp1[w][index] = min(c1, c3)
        dp2[b][index] = min(c2, c4)
        return min(c1, c2, c3, c4)
        #The program returns min(c1, c2, c3, c4), where c1 is the sum of `white_cost` from `index` to `index + cw - 1` plus `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)`, c2 is `float('inf')`, c3 is `float('inf')`, and c4 is `black_cost[m] + func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, m + 1, 0, b + 1)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts several parameters including 2D lists `dp1` and `dp2`, a 2D list `matrix`, positive integers `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, and costs `black_cost` and `white_cost`. It processes these inputs to calculate a minimum cost related to transforming pixels in the `matrix` from black to white or vice versa, using dynamic programming techniques. 

The function checks various conditions and recursively calculates costs based on the current state of groups of pixels (`w` and `b`), the costs of pixel transformations (`black_cost` and `white_cost`), and the bounds defined by `x` and `y`. Depending on these conditions, it can return 0, `float('inf')`, or the minimum value between certain computed costs. Specifically:

- If the index is out of bounds and certain width conditions are met, it returns 0.
- If the index is out of bounds and other width conditions are met, it also returns 0.
- If the index is out of bounds and neither width condition is met, it returns `float('inf')`.
- If precomputed values in `dp1` and `dp2` are available, it returns the minimum of those values.
- Otherwise, it computes four possible costs (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`) by recursively calling itself and potentially modifying the costs based on whether the current group of pixels is within bounds. It then updates `dp1` and `dp2` with the minimum cost for the current index and returns the minimum of these four costs.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where `x > y`, which should be a valid check.
- The function assumes `w` and `b` are non-negative integers, but it does not explicitly validate this.
- The function does not provide clear handling for invalid inputs like negative integers or non-lists for `dp1`, `dp2`, `matrix`, or invalid characters in `matrix`.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
