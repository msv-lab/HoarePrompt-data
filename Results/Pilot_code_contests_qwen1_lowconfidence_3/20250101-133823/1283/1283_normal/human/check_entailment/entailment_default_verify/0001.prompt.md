You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You've got an n × m pixel picture. Each pixel can be white or black. Your task is to change the colors of as few pixels as possible to obtain a barcode picture.

A picture is a barcode if the following conditions are fulfilled: 

  * All pixels in each column are of the same color. 
  * The width of each monochrome vertical line is at least x and at most y pixels. In other words, if we group all neighbouring columns of the pixels with equal color, the size of each group can not be less than x or greater than y. 

Input

The first line contains four space-separated integers n, m, x and y (1 ≤ n, m, x, y ≤ 1000; x ≤ y).

Then follow n lines, describing the original image. Each of these lines contains exactly m characters. Character "." represents a white pixel and "#" represents a black pixel. The picture description doesn't have any other characters besides "." and "#".

Output

In the first line print the minimum number of pixels to repaint. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Note

In the first test sample the picture after changing some colors can looks as follows: 
    
    
      
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    

In the second test sample the picture after changing some colors can looks as follows: 
    
    
      
    .#.#.  
    .#.#.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the initial configuration of the picture already satisfies the barcode conditions. Specifically, the program calculates the cost of converting the picture to a barcode configuration but does not check if the current picture is already a valid barcode.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3 1 3
###
###
###
```

In this case, the picture is already a valid barcode since all columns have the same color and the width of the monochrome vertical lines is within the specified range (1 to 3). However, the program will still calculate the cost of converting this picture, which is 0. This indicates that the program is not correctly identifying cases where no changes are needed.

To fix this, the program should first check if the current picture already meets the barcode conditions before proceeding with the cost calculation. If it does, the program should output 0 immediately.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts several parameters including 2D lists `dp1` and `dp2`, a 2D list `matrix`, positive integers `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, and costs `black_cost` and `white_cost`. It processes these inputs to calculate a minimum cost related to transforming pixels in the `matrix` from black to white or vice versa, using dynamic programming techniques. 

The function checks various conditions and recursively calculates costs based on the current state of groups of pixels (`w` and `b`), the costs of pixel transformations (`black_cost` and `white_cost`), and the bounds defined by `x` and `y`. Depending on these conditions, it can return 0, `float('inf')`, or the minimum value between certain computed costs. Specifically:

- If the index is out of bounds and certain width conditions are met, it returns 0.
- If the index is out of bounds and other width conditions are met, it also returns 0.
- If the index is out of bounds and neither width condition is met, it returns `float('inf')`.
- If precomputed values in `dp1` and `dp2` are available, it returns the minimum of those values.
- Otherwise, it computes four possible costs (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`) by recursively calling itself and potentially modifying the costs based on whether the current group of pixels is within bounds. It then updates `dp1` and `dp2` with the minimum cost for the current index and returns the minimum of these four costs.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where `x > y`, which should be a valid check.
- The function assumes `w` and `b` are non-negative integers, but it does not explicitly validate this.
- The function does not provide clear handling for invalid inputs like negative integers or non-lists for `dp1`, `dp2`, `matrix`, or invalid characters in `matrix`.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
