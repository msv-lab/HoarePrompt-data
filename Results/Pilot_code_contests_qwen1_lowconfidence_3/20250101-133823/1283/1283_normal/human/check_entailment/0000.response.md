Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the binary search logic for determining the minimum number of pixels to repaint. Instead, it seems to be attempting to solve the problem using dynamic programming, but there are several issues:

1. **Function Definitions**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are defined, but they are not called within the main logic of the program. This suggests that the main logic is missing.

2. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The dynamic programming approach used in `func_2` is complex and may not correctly handle all cases. For example, the function does not properly ensure that the final result is the minimum cost required to transform the image into a barcode format. The logic for updating the DP tables (`dp1` and `dp2`) and the conditions for breaking out of the loop might not be fully correct.

3. **Base Cases and Final Cost Calculation**: The base cases and the final cost calculation in `func_2` are not clearly defined. The function does not correctly handle the boundary conditions for the DP tables and the final cost computation.

Given these issues, it is difficult to verify that the program will work correctly for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To verify the correctness, you would need to test the program with various edge cases, such as images with different sizes and configurations, and ensure that the output matches the expected results. Since we cannot definitively confirm the correctness through this analysis alone, the program is deemed incorrect.
