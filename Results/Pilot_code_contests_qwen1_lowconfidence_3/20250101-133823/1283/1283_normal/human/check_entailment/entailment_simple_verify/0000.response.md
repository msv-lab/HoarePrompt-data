Final: **False**

Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The code includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but neither of them is being utilized correctly within the main logic of the program. Specifically, `func_1` computes the counts of black and white pixels in each column, which is a necessary step, but it is not being used effectively.

2. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The dynamic programming approach in `func_2` is complex and not fully implemented. There are several issues with how the states are being updated and how the minimum cost is being calculated. For instance:
   - The function does not handle the boundary conditions correctly, especially when it comes to the initialization and updating of the DP tables.
   - The logic for calculating the minimum cost to change the current column to a new group width does not seem to cover all possible cases, particularly when transitioning from one group width to another.
   - The recursive calls do not properly propagate the costs to the next columns, leading to potential overestimation or underestimation of the actual cost.

3. **Base Cases and Recursion**: The base cases and recursive steps in `func_2` are not fully defined. The function checks whether the current column index exceeds the total number of columns but does not properly handle the transitions between different group widths. The final cost calculation is also unclear and might lead to incorrect results.

Given these issues, the annotated version confirms that the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being incorrect is maintained.
