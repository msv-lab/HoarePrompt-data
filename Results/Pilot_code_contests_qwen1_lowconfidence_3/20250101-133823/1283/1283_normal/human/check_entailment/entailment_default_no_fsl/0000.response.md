Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where `x > y`, which is a valid condition according to the problem description. Additionally, the function `func_2` does not properly handle the bounds checking for `w` and `b` to ensure they stay within the range `[x, y]`. This could lead to incorrect results or infinite recursion in some cases.
