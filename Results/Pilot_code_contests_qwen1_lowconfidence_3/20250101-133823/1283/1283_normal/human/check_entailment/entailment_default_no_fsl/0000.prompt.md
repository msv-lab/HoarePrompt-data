You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You've got an n × m pixel picture. Each pixel can be white or black. Your task is to change the colors of as few pixels as possible to obtain a barcode picture.

A picture is a barcode if the following conditions are fulfilled: 

  * All pixels in each column are of the same color. 
  * The width of each monochrome vertical line is at least x and at most y pixels. In other words, if we group all neighbouring columns of the pixels with equal color, the size of each group can not be less than x or greater than y. 

Input

The first line contains four space-separated integers n, m, x and y (1 ≤ n, m, x, y ≤ 1000; x ≤ y).

Then follow n lines, describing the original image. Each of these lines contains exactly m characters. Character "." represents a white pixel and "#" represents a black pixel. The picture description doesn't have any other characters besides "." and "#".

Output

In the first line print the minimum number of pixels to repaint. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Note

In the first test sample the picture after changing some colors can looks as follows: 
    
    
      
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    

In the second test sample the picture after changing some colors can looks as follows: 
    
    
      
    .#.#.  
    .#.#.

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list `matrix` of strings, where each string represents a row of a pixel picture consisting of "." and "#", and two positive integers `n` and `m` representing the number of rows and columns in the matrix. It then iterates over each column of the matrix to count the number of "#" and "." characters in each column. The function returns two lists: `black_cost` and `white_cost`, where `black_cost` contains the count of "#" characters in each column, and `white_cost` contains the count of "." characters in each column. This process effectively summarizes the distribution of pixels in terms of "#" and "." across all columns of the matrix. Potential edge cases include when the matrix is empty (i.e., `n` or `m` is 0), which would result in both `black_cost` and `white_cost` being empty lists. There is no missing functionality as described in the provided code.

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts several parameters including 2D lists `dp1` and `dp2`, a 2D list `matrix`, positive integers `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, and costs `black_cost` and `white_cost`. It processes these inputs to calculate a minimum cost related to transforming pixels in the `matrix` from black to white or vice versa, using dynamic programming techniques. 

The function checks various conditions and recursively calculates costs based on the current state of groups of pixels (`w` and `b`), the costs of pixel transformations (`black_cost` and `white_cost`), and the bounds defined by `x` and `y`. Depending on these conditions, it can return 0, `float('inf')`, or the minimum value between certain computed costs. Specifically:

- If the index is out of bounds and certain width conditions are met, it returns 0.
- If the index is out of bounds and other width conditions are met, it also returns 0.
- If the index is out of bounds and neither width condition is met, it returns `float('inf')`.
- If precomputed values in `dp1` and `dp2` are available, it returns the minimum of those values.
- Otherwise, it computes four possible costs (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`) by recursively calling itself and potentially modifying the costs based on whether the current group of pixels is within bounds. It then updates `dp1` and `dp2` with the minimum cost for the current index and returns the minimum of these four costs.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where `x > y`, which should be a valid check.
- The function assumes `w` and `b` are non-negative integers, but it does not explicitly validate this.
- The function does not provide clear handling for invalid inputs like negative integers or non-lists for `dp1`, `dp2`, `matrix`, or invalid characters in `matrix`.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
