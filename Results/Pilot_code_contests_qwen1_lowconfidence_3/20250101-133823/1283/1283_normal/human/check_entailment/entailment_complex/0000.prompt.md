You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You've got an n × m pixel picture. Each pixel can be white or black. Your task is to change the colors of as few pixels as possible to obtain a barcode picture.

A picture is a barcode if the following conditions are fulfilled: 

  * All pixels in each column are of the same color. 
  * The width of each monochrome vertical line is at least x and at most y pixels. In other words, if we group all neighbouring columns of the pixels with equal color, the size of each group can not be less than x or greater than y. 

Input

The first line contains four space-separated integers n, m, x and y (1 ≤ n, m, x, y ≤ 1000; x ≤ y).

Then follow n lines, describing the original image. Each of these lines contains exactly m characters. Character "." represents a white pixel and "#" represents a black pixel. The picture description doesn't have any other characters besides "." and "#".

Output

In the first line print the minimum number of pixels to repaint. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list `matrix` of strings, where each string represents a row of a pixel picture consisting of "." and "#", and two positive integers `n` and `m` representing the number of rows and columns in the matrix. It then iterates over each column of the matrix to count the number of "#" and "." characters in each column. The function returns two lists: `black_cost` and `white_cost`, where `black_cost` contains the count of "#" characters in each column, and `white_cost` contains the count of "." characters in each column. This process effectively summarizes the distribution of pixels in terms of "#" and "." across all columns of the matrix. Potential edge cases include when the matrix is empty (i.e., `n` or `m` is 0), which would result in both `black_cost` and `white_cost` being empty lists. There is no missing functionality as described in the provided code.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts several parameters including 2D lists `dp1` and `dp2`, a 2D list `matrix`, positive integers `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, and costs `black_cost` and `white_cost`. It processes these inputs to calculate a minimum cost related to transforming pixels in the `matrix` from black to white or vice versa, using dynamic programming techniques. 

The function checks various conditions and recursively calculates costs based on the current state of groups of pixels (`w` and `b`), the costs of pixel transformations (`black_cost` and `white_cost`), and the bounds defined by `x` and `y`. Depending on these conditions, it can return 0, `float('inf')`, or the minimum value between certain computed costs. Specifically:

- If the index is out of bounds and certain width conditions are met, it returns 0.
- If the index is out of bounds and other width conditions are met, it also returns 0.
- If the index is out of bounds and neither width condition is met, it returns `float('inf')`.
- If precomputed values in `dp1` and `dp2` are available, it returns the minimum of those values.
- Otherwise, it computes four possible costs (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`) by recursively calling itself and potentially modifying the costs based on whether the current group of pixels is within bounds. It then updates `dp1` and `dp2` with the minimum cost for the current index and returns the minimum of these four costs.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where `x > y`, which should be a valid check.
- The function assumes `w` and `b` are non-negative integers, but it does not explicitly validate this.
- The function does not provide clear handling for invalid inputs like negative integers or non-lists for `dp1`, `dp2`, `matrix`, or invalid characters in `matrix`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
