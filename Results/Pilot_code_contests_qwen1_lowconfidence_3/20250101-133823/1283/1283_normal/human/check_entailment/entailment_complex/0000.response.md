Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where `x > y`, which is explicitly stated as a requirement in the problem description. According to the problem description, the width of each monochrome vertical line should be at least `x` and at most `y` pixels. However, the code does not enforce this constraint, which means it could produce invalid solutions if `x > y`. This is a critical edge case that the code fails to address, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
