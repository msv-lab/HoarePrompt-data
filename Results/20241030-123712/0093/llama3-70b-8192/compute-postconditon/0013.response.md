`x1` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is less than 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `puzzle1[4]` is 'X', if so `x1` is set to 4; `puzzle2[4]` is 'X', if so `x2` is set to 4; `i` is less than 0; `puzzle1[i]` is 'X', if so `x1` is set to `i`; `puzzle2[i]` is 'X', if so `x2` is set to `i`, `x1` is `i`.

Output State: **`puzzle1[4]` is 'X', if so `x1` is set to 4; `puzzle2[4]` is 'X', if so `x2` is set to 4; `i` is less than 0; `puzzle1[i]` is 'X', if so `x1` is set to `i`; `puzzle2[i]` is 'X', if so `x2` is set to `i`, `x1` is `i`**
