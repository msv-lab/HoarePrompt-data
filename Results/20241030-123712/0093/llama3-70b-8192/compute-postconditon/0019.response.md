Output State: **The input consists of two 2Ã—2 grids (each represented as two lines of strings) where each grid contains exactly one of each character 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. If `i` is initially less than 0, the loop will be executed. If `puzzle1[i]` is 'X', then `x1` is set to `i`. If `puzzle2[i]` is 'X', then `x2` is set to `i`. `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration. The loop will continue until `i` is no longer less than 0. If `i` is initially 0 or greater, the loop will not be executed, and `x1`, `x2`, and `i` will remain unchanged from their initial values.**
