`count` is multiplied by 10. The initial value of `count` is 90, so after multiplication, `count` is 900. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is (input integer minus 189) and the input integer is greater than 189, `length` is 3, `count` is 900, `start` is 10.

Output State: **`k` is (input integer minus 189) and the input integer is greater than 189, `length` is 3, `count` is 900, `start` is 10**
