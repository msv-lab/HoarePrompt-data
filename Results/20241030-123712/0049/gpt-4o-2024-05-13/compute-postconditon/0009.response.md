`k` is assigned the value `k - length * count`. `length` is 2 and `count` is 90, so `length * count` equals 180. The initial value of `k` is an input integer minus 9. Therefore, the new value of `k` is the initial value of `k` minus 180, which is (input integer minus 9) minus 180.

Output State: **`k` is (input integer minus 189) and the input integer is greater than 189, `length` is 2, `count` is 90, `start` is 10**
