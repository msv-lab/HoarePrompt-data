`k` is decremented by the length of `s`, which is 1 (since `s` is "3"). Given that the initial state of `k` is `(input integer - 1 - 1)`, the new value of `k` is `(input integer - 1 - 1) - 1`. The states of `n` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is (input integer - 3), `n` is 3, `s` is "3"**
