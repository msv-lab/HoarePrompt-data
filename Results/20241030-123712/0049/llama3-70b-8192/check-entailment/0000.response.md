Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program is designed to find the $k$-th digit in an infinite sequence of concatenated integers starting from 1. However, there are significant flaws in the logic when handling very large values of $k$, particularly when $k$ exceeds the combined length of numbers from 1 to `n` where `n` is a reasonably small number.

For instance, let's consider the following case:

Input:
```
1000000000000
```

For such a large value of $k$, the algorithm becomes highly inefficient and practically infeasible as it will iterate through an enormous number of numbers and perform an excessive amount of string concatenation operations.

Additionally, for extremely large values of $k$, the length of the string representation of the numbers from 1 to `n` will grow disproportionately large, causing significant performance issues and potentially leading to memory errors.

Thus, the current implementation does not handle the edge case of very large $k$ efficiently, leading to incorrect or impractical behavior. The correct approach should involve a more mathematical method to directly determine the $k$-th digit without iterating through every integer.
