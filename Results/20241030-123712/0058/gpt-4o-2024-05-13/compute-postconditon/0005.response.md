The `print` function outputs the value of `minimal_bars_needed`. The initial state already provides its value, so the output state will include this printed value.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `total_length_needed` is 2 * (2 * a + b), `minimal_bars_needed` is (2 * (2 * a + b) + n - 1) // n, and `minimal_bars_needed` is printed**
