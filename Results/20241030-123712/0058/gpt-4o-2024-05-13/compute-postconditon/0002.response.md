`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
