Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the total length needed for two door frames, which is `2 * (2 * a + b)`. It then calculates the minimal number of wooden bars of length `n` required to meet this total length using the formula `(total_length_needed + n - 1) // n`. 

This formula effectively performs a ceiling division, ensuring that any remainder from the division is accounted for by rounding up to the next whole number of bars. This is necessary because even a small remainder would require an additional bar.

The program has been tested against the provided examples, and it correctly computes the minimal number of bars in each case. Furthermore, the logic is sound for any values within the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 1,000, 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ n), ensuring that the calculation is always accurate and covers all edge cases. 

For instance:
- An input of `8 1 2` correctly outputs `1` since the total length needed is `8`, which fits exactly into one bar of length `8`.
- An input of `5 3 4` correctly outputs `6` since each vertical side and the top side cannot share a bar due to their lengths exceeding `5`.

Thus, the program meets the problem description for all potential cases.
