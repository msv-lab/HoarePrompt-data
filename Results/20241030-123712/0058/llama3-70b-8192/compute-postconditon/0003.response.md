`total_length` is assigned the value `2 * (a * 2 + b)`. The values of `a` and `b` are input integers, and `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the value of `total_length` will be calculated based on the input values of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `total_length` is 2 * (a * 2 + b)**
