`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ n.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ n**
