Thinking step by step:

1. The condition for the `while` loop to execute is `j < 0`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `j` is less than or equal to 0.
3. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `j` must strictly be less than 0.

Given the state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6.
- `MOD` is 998244353.
- `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp[3]` which is `dp[3] + dp[3] % 998244353`.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is less than or equal to 0.

Since the loop condition is `j < 0` and `j` is already less than or equal to 0, no adjustment is needed to `j` as it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute again. The rest of the state variables (`n`, `MOD`, `dp`, and `i`) do not impact the condition for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the program state does not need to be modified.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp[3]` which is `dp[3] + dp[3] % 998244353`, `i` is 3, `j` is less than or equal to 0**
