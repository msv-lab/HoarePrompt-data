According to the `while` loop condition `while j < 0`, the loop will execute only if `j` is less than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `j` is less than 0.

Here's the state modification:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where dp[0] is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is 1, `j` is less than 0, `dp[1]` is updated to `dp[1] % MOD`**
