`j` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is 1. Therefore, `j` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where dp[0] is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1.
