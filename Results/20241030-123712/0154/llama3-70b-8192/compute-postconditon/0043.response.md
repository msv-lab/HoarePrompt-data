`j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is less than 0. Therefore, after the increment, `j` is still less than or equal to 0. The values of `n`, `MOD`, `dp`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp[3]` which is `dp[3] + dp[3] % 998244353`, `i` is 3, `j` is less than or equal to 0**
