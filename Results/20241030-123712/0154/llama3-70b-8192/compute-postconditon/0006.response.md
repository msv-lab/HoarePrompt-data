`dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] % MOD`, and `MOD` is 998244353. Given `i` is 1 and previously `dp[1]` was updated to `dp[1] + dp[1] * dp[1 - 1 - 1] * ((1 - 1) // 1 % 2)`, which simplifies to `dp[1] + dp[1] * dp[-1] * 0`. Since `dp[-1]` is out of bounds, it's assumed to be `0`, so the expression simplifies to `dp[1] = dp[1]`. Thus, `dp[1]` remains unchanged. After applying `dp[i] %= MOD`, `dp[1]` remains the same as it was already less than `MOD`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where dp[0] is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `dp[1]` is updated to `dp[1] % MOD`**
