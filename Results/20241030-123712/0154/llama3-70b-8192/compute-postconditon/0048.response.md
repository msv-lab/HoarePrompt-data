Let's carefully analyze the given `while` loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration to determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6
- `MOD` is 998244353
- `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp[3]` which is `dp[3] % 998244353`
- `i` is 3
- `j` is less than or equal to 1

### Given `while` Loop:
```
while j < 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j < 0`.
2. **End of Previous Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is less than or equal to 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `j < 0` must be satisfied. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is less than or equal to 1, but this does not guarantee that `j` is less than 0. We need to ensure that `j` is specifically less than 0.

### Modification Required:
To make sure the loop can execute one more time, we must adjust the state to ensure that `j` is less than 0.

### Final Program State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp[3]` which is `dp[3] % 998244353`, `i` is 3, `j` is less than 0**
