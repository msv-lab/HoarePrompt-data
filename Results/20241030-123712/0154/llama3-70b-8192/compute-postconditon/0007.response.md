`j` is incremented by 1, so the value of `j` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where dp[0] is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `dp[1]` is updated to `dp[1] % MOD`**
