Given the initial state and the loop's code, let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the output state.

The loop's condition is `while j < 0`. 

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6
- `MOD` is 998244353
- `dp` is a list where dp[0] is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1`
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 1

Since the condition for the loop to execute is `while j < 0`, and initially `j` is 1, the loop will **not execute** even once because the condition `j < 0` is false.

Thus, the output state of the loop will be the same as the initial state, with no changes to any of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where dp[0] is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1.**
