To determine which states need to be adjusted so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the loop: `while j < 0`. For the loop to proceed, `j` must be less than 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6
- `MOD` is 998244353
- `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1`
- `i` is 1
- `j` is less than 0 incremented by 1
- `dp[1]` is updated to `dp[1] % MOD`
- `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] += 0` since `j` is less than 0, effectively not changing `dp[i]`
- `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] % MOD`

The crucial part of this state is the condition of `j`. It is stated that `j` is less than 0 incremented by 1, which means `j` is less than 1. For the loop to continue, `j` needs to remain less than 0.

Therefore, `j` should be less than 0, which is already satisfied by the provided state.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where dp[0] is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is 1, `j` is less than 0 incremented by 1, `dp[1]` is updated to `dp[1] % MOD`, `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] += 0` since `j` is less than 0, effectively not changing `dp[i]`, `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] % MOD`**
