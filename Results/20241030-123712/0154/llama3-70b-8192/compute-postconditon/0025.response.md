Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[2]` is updated to `dp[2] % 998244353`, the rest are zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is less than 0, `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] + dp[j] * dp[i - j - 1] * ((i - 1) // j % 2)`**
