`dp[0]` is assigned the value `1`. Since `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, after execution, `dp[0]` will be `1` and the rest will remain `0`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where dp[0] is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1`**
