`i` is assigned the value `i + 1`, and `i` is 3, so after execution, `i` is 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where dp[0] is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is 4, `j` is 3.
