Output State: **The loop will not execute because the condition `j < 0` is false initially (`j` starts at 2). Therefore, the output state will be the same as the initial state. `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where dp[0] is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2.**
