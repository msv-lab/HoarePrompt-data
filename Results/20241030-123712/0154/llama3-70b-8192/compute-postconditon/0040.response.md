The given loop condition is `while j < 0:`. For this loop to execute, `j` must be less than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4. Since 4 is not less than 0, the current state does not allow the loop to proceed.

To modify the state so that the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `j` satisfies the condition `j < 0`. Therefore, we need to set `j` to a value that is less than 0.

The provided state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6
- `MOD` is 998244353
- `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp[3]` which is `dp[3] + dp[3] * dp[3 - 3 - 1] * ((3 - 1) // 3 % 2) % 998244353`
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 4

We need to adjust `j` to be less than 0. No other states need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp[3]` which is `dp[3] + dp[3] * dp[3 - 3 - 1] * ((3 - 1) // 3 % 2) % 998244353`, `i` is 3, `j` is less than 0**
