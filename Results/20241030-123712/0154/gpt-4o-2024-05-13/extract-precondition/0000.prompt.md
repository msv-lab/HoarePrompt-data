You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Recall that a binary search tree is a rooted binary tree, whose nodes each store a key and each have at most two distinguished subtrees, left and right. The key in each node must be greater than any key stored in the left subtree, and less than any key stored in the right subtree.

The depth of a vertex is the number of edges on the simple path from the vertex to the root. In particular, the depth of the root is $0$.

Let's call a binary search tree perfectly balanced if there doesn't exist a binary search tree with the same number of vertices that has a strictly smaller sum of depths of its vertices.

Let's call a binary search tree with integer keys striped if both of the following conditions are satisfied for every vertex $v$:   If $v$ has a left subtree whose root is $u$, then the parity of the key of $v$ is different from the parity of the key of $u$.  If $v$ has a right subtree whose root is $w$, then the parity of the key of $v$ is the same as the parity of the key of $w$. 

You are given a single integer $n$. Find the number of perfectly balanced striped binary search trees with $n$ vertices that have distinct integer keys between $1$ and $n$, inclusive. Output this number modulo $998\,244\,353$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^6$), denoting the required number of vertices.


-----Output-----

Output the number of perfectly balanced striped binary search trees with $n$ vertices and distinct integer keys between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, modulo $998\,244\,353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
4

Output
1

Input
3

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example, this is the only tree that satisfies the conditions: $\left. \begin{array}{l}{\text{perfectly balanced}} \\{\text{striped}} \\{\text{binary search tree}} \end{array} \right.$

In the second example, here are various trees that don't satisfy some condition: [Image]
Program:
```
MOD = 998244353

def count_balanced_striped_trees(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    if n == 2:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize DP arrays
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    dp[1] = 1  # Only one tree with one node
    dp[2] = 0  # No valid tree with two nodes due to striped condition
    
    # Precompute powers of two up to n for efficiency
    power_of_two = [1] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        power_of_two[i] = (power_of_two[i - 1] * 2) % MOD
    
    # Fill dp array
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        # Calculate number of balanced striped trees with i nodes
        half = (i - 1) // 2
        if (i - 1) % 2 == 0:
            dp[i] = (dp[half] * dp[half] * 2) % MOD
        else:
            dp[i] = (dp[half] * dp[half + 1] * 2) % MOD
    
    return dp[n]

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
n = int(input().strip())

# Output the result
print(count_balanced_striped_trees(n))
