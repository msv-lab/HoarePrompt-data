Output State: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^6. For `n` equals 1, it returns 1. For `n` equals 2, it returns 0. For `n` >= 3, it uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate and return `dp[n]` with a modulus of 998244353. For any other value of `n`, the behavior is undefined. The `input` is set to read from `sys.stdin`. `n` is an input integer.**
