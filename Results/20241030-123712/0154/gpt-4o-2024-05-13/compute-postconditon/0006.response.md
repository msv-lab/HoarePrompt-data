`dp[0]` is assigned the value `1`. The states of `n` and `MOD` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list with the first element as 1 and the remaining `n` elements as 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list with the first element as 1 and the remaining `n` elements as 0**
