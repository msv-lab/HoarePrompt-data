`dp` is assigned a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. The states of `n` and `MOD` remain unchanged. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`**
