Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` for `3 <= i <= n` is calculated based on the conditions provided in the loop (i.e., if `(i - 1) % 2 == 0` then `dp[i] = dp[half] * dp[half] * 2 % MOD`, otherwise `dp[i] = dp[half] * dp[half + 1] * 2 % MOD` where `half = (i - 1) // 2`), `power_of_two` is a list with `n+1` elements where `power_of_two[i]` is equal to `2^i % MOD` for all `0 <= i <= n`, `i` is `n + 1`, and the function returns `dp[n]`**
