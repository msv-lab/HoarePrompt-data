Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list with the first element as 1, the second element as 1, the third element as 2 or 4 (depending on the condition), and `dp[4]` set to 4 (since `dp[1] * dp[1] * 2 % 998244353 = 1 * 1 * 2 % 998244353 = 2`), `power_of_two` is a list with `n+1` elements where `power_of_two[i]` is equal to `2^i % MOD` for all `0 <= i <= n`, `i` is 4, `half` is 1**
