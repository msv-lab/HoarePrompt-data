`dp[2]` is assigned the value 0. The initial state mentions that the first two elements of `dp` are 1, and the remaining `n-1` elements are 0. Therefore, `dp[2]` was initially 0 and remains 0. The state of `n` and `MOD` does not change.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list with the first two elements as 1 and the remaining `n-1` elements as 0**
