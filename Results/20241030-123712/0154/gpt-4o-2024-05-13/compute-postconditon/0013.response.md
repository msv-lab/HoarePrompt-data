According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6. 

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to verify or adjust `i` and `n` such that `i` is less than `n + 1`. Given `i` is already 2 and `n` is within the specified range, the loop will certainly execute again because `i = 2` is less than any `n + 1` where `n` is at least 1.

Therefore, we do not need to make any changes to the state, as the loop will execute at least one more time with the given state.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list with the first two elements as 1 and the remaining `n-1` elements as 0, `power_of_two` is a list with `n+1` elements where the first element is 1 and the `i-th` element is 2, `i` is 2**
