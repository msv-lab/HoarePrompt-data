According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Therefore, `n + 1` should be greater than `i`.

So, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n + 1` is greater than `i`. Since `i` is already increased by 1 at the end of the last iteration, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to `i`.

State: **variable `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`**
