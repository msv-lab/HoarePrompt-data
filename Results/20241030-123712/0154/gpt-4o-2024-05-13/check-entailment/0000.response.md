Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given problem requires us to find the number of perfectly balanced striped binary search trees with `n` vertices and distinct integer keys between `1` and `n`, inclusive, modulo `998244353`. Let's analyze the provided code to see if it meets the problem's requirements.

To determine if the code works correctly, we need to understand the following:
1. What constitutes a perfectly balanced striped binary search tree.
2. Whether the dynamic programming approach correctly counts such trees.

Issues with the provided program:
1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The code initializes `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` correctly but sets `dp[2]` to 0 without any proper justification in the context of balanced striped BSTs.
2. **Calculation of `dp[i]`**:
    - The code calculates the number of balanced striped trees by considering `half = (i - 1) // 2`. If `(i - 1) % 2 == 0`, it attempts to use `dp[half]` twice, which does not align with the structure of balanced striped BSTs.
    - The use of `dp[half] * dp[half + 1]` when `(i - 1) % 2 != 0` is unclear and lacks theoretical backing.

To illustrate the problems, let's consider an example:

Example:
- For `n = 3`, the expected output is `0` as per the problem description, but this is not guaranteed by the code. The condition and calculation inside the loop do not ensure the correct count of balanced striped BSTs.
- For `n = 4`, the expected output is `1`. The provided code might not correctly compute this due to the incorrect logic in the dynamic programming steps.

Edge Case:
- For large `n`, the logic applied in the dynamic programming approach does not guarantee the correct number of balanced striped BSTs. The problem statement specifies strict conditions that the code doesn't fully account for.

Hence, the provided program does not align with the problem's requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
