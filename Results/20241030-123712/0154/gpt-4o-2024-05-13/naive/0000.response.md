RESULT: **Incorrect**

Explanation: The code attempts to use dynamic programming to count the number of perfectly balanced striped binary search trees. However, the core logic of determining the number of valid trees does not correctly account for the constraints of the problem, specifically the "striped" condition, which requires the parity of keys in the left and right subtrees to be different and the same, respectively. The code uses a simple product of dynamic programming values without ensuring the "striped" condition is met. Thus, it does not produce the correct results.
