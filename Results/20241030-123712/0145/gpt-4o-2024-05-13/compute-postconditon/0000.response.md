`username` is assigned the value `input().strip()`, where `input` accepts an input and `strip()` removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the input string. The previous value of `username` is replaced by the new input value after stripping whitespace. Therefore, the output state is: `username` is a non-empty string containing at most 100 lowercase English letters with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

Output State: **`username` is a non-empty string containing at most 100 lowercase English letters with leading and trailing whitespace removed**
