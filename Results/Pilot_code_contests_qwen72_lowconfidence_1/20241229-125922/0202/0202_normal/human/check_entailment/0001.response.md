Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `N` is 1 correctly. According to the problem description, `N` is a positive integer, and the constraints state that `2 ≤ N ≤ 10^6`. However, if we consider the edge case where `N` is 1, the program will not produce the correct output because the loop `for i in range(1, N)` will not run at all, leading to a count of 0, which is incorrect.

Additionally, the program's logic for counting the tuples `(A, B, C)` is flawed. The function `func_1` returns all divisors of `n`, but the program only counts the number of divisors of `N - i` for each `i` in the range `[1, N-1]`. This does not correctly account for all possible values of `A`, `B`, and `C` that satisfy `A * B + C = N`.

For example, if `N = 3`, the correct output should be 3, corresponding to the tuples `(1, 1, 2)`, `(1, 2, 1)`, and `(2, 1, 1)`. However, the program will not correctly count these tuples.
