Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when \( N = 1 \). According to the problem description, \( N \) is a positive integer, and the constraints specify \( 2 \leq N \leq 10^6 \). However, the program's logic assumes that \( N \) is at least 2, and it does not account for the possibility of \( N = 1 \).

Additionally, the program's logic for counting the tuples \((A, B, C)\) is incorrect. The loop iterates from 1 to \( N-1 \) and calls `func_1(N - i)` to get the divisors of \( N - i \). However, the number of valid tuples \((A, B, C)\) should be counted as follows:

- For each \( A \) from 1 to \( N-1 \), the equation \( A \times B + C = N \) can be rewritten as \( C = N - A \times B \).
- \( C \) must be a positive integer, so \( N - A \times B > 0 \), which means \( B \) must be a divisor of \( N - A \).

The current implementation does not correctly count the number of valid tuples because it does not ensure that \( C \) is positive for all values of \( B \).

To fix this, the program should iterate over all possible values of \( A \) and \( B \) and check if \( C \) is a positive integer. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
N = int(input())
count = 0
for A in range(1, N):
    for B in range(1, (N - 1) // A + 1):
        C = N - A * B
        if C > 0:
            count += 1
print(count)
```

This corrected version ensures that \( C \) is always a positive integer and correctly counts the number of valid tuples \((A, B, C)\).
