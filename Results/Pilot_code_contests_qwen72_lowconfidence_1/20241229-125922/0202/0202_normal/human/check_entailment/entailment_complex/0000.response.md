Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `N` from standard input, which is consistent with the problem's requirement that `2 ≤ N ≤ 10^6`.

2. **Counting Valid Tuples**:
   - The main loop iterates over possible values of `A` from 1 to `N-1`.
   - For each value of `A`, the expression `A * B + C = N` can be rewritten as `C = N - A * B`.
   - The inner function `func_1` is used to find all divisors of `N - A` (denoted as `n` in the function). Each divisor represents a possible value for `B`, and `C` is then determined as `N - A * B`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` efficiently finds all divisors of a given integer `n` by iterating up to the square root of `n`.
   - It separates divisors into `lower_divisors` (less than or equal to the square root) and `upper_divisors` (greater than the square root), ensuring no duplicates.
   - The function returns a list of all divisors in ascending order.

4. **Correctness of the Counting Logic**:
   - For each `A` from 1 to `N-1`, the program counts the number of divisors of `N - A` using `func_1`.
   - Each divisor of `N - A` corresponds to a valid tuple `(A, B, C)` where `B` is the divisor and `C` is `N - A * B`.
   - The total count of valid tuples is accumulated in the variable `count`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final count of valid tuples, which is the required output according to the problem description.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints specified in the problem description, ensuring that it correctly counts the number of valid tuples `(A, B, C)` for any input `N` within the given range. Therefore, the program is correct.
