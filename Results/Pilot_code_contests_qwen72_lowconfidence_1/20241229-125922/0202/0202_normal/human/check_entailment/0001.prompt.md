You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Given is a positive integer N. How many tuples (A,B,C) of positive integers satisfy A \times B + C = N?

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 10^6
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N


Output

Print the answer.

Examples

Input

3


Output

3


Input

100


Output

473


Input

1000000


Output

13969985
Program:
```
N = int(input())
count = 0
for i in range(1, N):
    count += len(func_1(N - i))
print(count)

def func_1(n):
    (lower_divisors, upper_divisors) = ([], [])
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            lower_divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                upper_divisors.append(n // i)
        i += 1
    return lower_divisors + upper_divisors[::-1]


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
