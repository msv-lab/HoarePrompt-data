Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when \(N = 1\) correctly. According to the problem constraints, \(N\) is a positive integer, and the smallest possible value for \(N\) is 2. However, the program's logic for counting tuples (A, B, C) assumes that \(N\) can be greater than 1. Specifically, the loop `for i in range(1, N):` will not execute when \(N = 1\), leading to an incorrect count of tuples. Since the program does not meet the requirements for this edge case, it is considered incorrect.
