You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Given is a positive integer N. How many tuples (A,B,C) of positive integers satisfy A \times B + C = N?

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 10^6
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N


Output

Print the answer.

Examples

Input

3


Output

3


Input

100


Output

473


Input

1000000


Output

13969985
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
N = int(input())
count = 0
for i in range(1, N):
    count += len(func_1(N - i))
print(count)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
def func_1(n):
    lower_divisors, upper_divisors = [], []
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            lower_divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                upper_divisors.append(n // i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`, `lower_divisors` contains all divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n`, `upper_divisors` contains all divisors of `n` that are greater than the square root of `n`, excluding the square root itself if it is a perfect square.
    return lower_divisors + upper_divisors[::-1]
    #The program returns a list that combines `lower_divisors` (all divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n`) with the reversed `upper_divisors` (all divisors of `n` that are greater than the square root of `n`, excluding the square root itself if it is a perfect square).

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
