The code snippet `upper_divisors.append(n // i)` appends the value of `n // i` to the list `upper_divisors`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
- `i` is 2.
- `lower_divisors` is [1, 2].
- If `1` is not equal to `n // 1`, then `upper_divisors` is [n]; otherwise, `upper_divisors` is an empty list.

Since `i` is 2, the value `n // i` is `n // 2`. This value is appended to `upper_divisors`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
- `i` is 2.
- `lower_divisors` is [1, 2].
- `upper_divisors` is [n, n // 2].

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 2, `lower_divisors` is [1, 2], `upper_divisors` is [n, n // 2]**
