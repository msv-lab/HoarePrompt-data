The code snippet `lower_divisors.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `lower_divisors`. The rest of the initial conditions remain unchanged.

- `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
- `i` is 3.
- If `n % i == 0`, then `lower_divisors` was initially [1, 2].
- If `i` is not equal to `n // i`, then `upper_divisors` is [n, n // 2].
- Otherwise, `upper_divisors` is [n] if `1` is not equal to `n // 1`, or an empty list if `1` is equal to `n // 1`.
- If `n % i != 0`, then `lower_divisors` was initially [1] and `upper_divisors` is [n] if `1` is not equal to `n // 1`, or an empty list if `1` is equal to `n // 1`.

After executing the code snippet, `lower_divisors` is updated to include the value 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 3, if `n % i == 0`, then `lower_divisors` is [1, 2, 3], if `i` is not equal to `n // i`, then `upper_divisors` is [n, n // 2], otherwise `upper_divisors` is [n] if `1` is not equal to `n // 1`, or an empty list if `1` is equal to `n // 1`, if `n % i != 0`, then `lower_divisors` is [1, 3] and `upper_divisors` is [n] if `1` is not equal to `n // 1`, or an empty list if `1` is equal to `n // 1`.**
