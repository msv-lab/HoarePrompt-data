The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 2, so after the increment, `i` becomes 3. The conditions and values of `n`, `lower_divisors`, and `upper_divisors` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 3. If `n % i == 0`, then `lower_divisors` is [1, 2]. If `i` is not equal to `n // i`, then `upper_divisors` is [n, n // 2]. Otherwise, `upper_divisors` is [n] if `1` is not equal to `n // 1`, or an empty list if `1` is equal to `n // 1`. If `n % i != 0`, then `lower_divisors` is [1] and `upper_divisors` is [n] if `1` is not equal to `n // 1`, or an empty list if `1` is equal to `n // 1`.**
