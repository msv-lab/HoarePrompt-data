Output State: **The program returns a list that combines `lower_divisors` (all divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n`) with the reversed `upper_divisors` (all divisors of `n` that are greater than the square root of `n`, excluding the square root itself if it is a perfect square).**
