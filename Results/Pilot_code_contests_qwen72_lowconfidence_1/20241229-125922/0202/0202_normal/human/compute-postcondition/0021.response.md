The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 3 to 4. The conditions for updating `lower_divisors` and `upper_divisors` based on the value of `n % i` and `i != n // i` remain unchanged since the code only modifies `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 4. If `n % i == 0`, then `lower_divisors` is [1, 2, 3]. If `i != n // i`, `upper_divisors` is [n, n // 2, n // 3]. If `i == n // i`, `upper_divisors` is [n] if `1` is not equal to `n // 1`, or an empty list if `1` is equal to `n // 1`. If `n % i != 0`, then `lower_divisors` is [1] and `upper_divisors` is [n] if `1` is not equal to `n // 1`, or an empty list if `1` is equal to `n // 1`.**
