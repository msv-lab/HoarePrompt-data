The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6. The function returns a list that combines all divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n` with the reversed list of all divisors of `n` that are greater than the square root of `n`, excluding the square root itself if it is a perfect square.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10^6) and returns a list combining all divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n` with the reversed list of all divisors of `n` that are greater than the square root of `n`, excluding the square root itself if it is a perfect square.**
