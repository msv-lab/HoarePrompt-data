The code `lower_divisors.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `lower_divisors`.

- `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
- `i` is 2.
- `lower_divisors` was initially [1] because `n % 1 == 0`.
- `upper_divisors` is [n] if `1` is not equal to `n // 1`, otherwise it remains an empty list.

After executing the code, `lower_divisors` becomes [1, 2].

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 2, `lower_divisors` is [1, 2], if `1` is not equal to `n // 1`, then `upper_divisors` is [n], otherwise `upper_divisors` is an empty list.**
