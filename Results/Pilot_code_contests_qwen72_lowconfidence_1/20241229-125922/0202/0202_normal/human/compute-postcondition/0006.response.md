The value `n // i` is appended to the list `upper_divisors`. Given that `i` is 1, `n // i` equals `n`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `lower_divisors` is [1], `upper_divisors` is [n], `i` is 1, `n % i == 0`, and `i` is not equal to `n // i`**
