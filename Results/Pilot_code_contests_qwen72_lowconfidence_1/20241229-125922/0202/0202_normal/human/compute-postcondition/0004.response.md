The code `lower_divisors.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `lower_divisors`. Since `i` is 1 and `n % i == 0` (which is true for any integer `n`), `1` is appended to `lower_divisors`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `lower_divisors` is [1], `upper_divisors` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and `n % i == 0`**.
