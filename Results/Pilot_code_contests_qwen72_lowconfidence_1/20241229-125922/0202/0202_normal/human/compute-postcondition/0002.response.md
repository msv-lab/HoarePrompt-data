According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop condition is `i * i <= n`. Right before the loop, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6. For the loop to execute, `i * i` (which is 1) must be less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is at least 2, the condition `i * i <= n` is already satisfied.

No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `lower_divisors` is an empty list, `upper_divisors` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
