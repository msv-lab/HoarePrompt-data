To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to evaluate the condition `i * i <= n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
- `i` is 2.
- If `n % 1 == 0`, then `lower_divisors` is [1].
- If `1` is not equal to `n // 1`, then `upper_divisors` is [n]. Otherwise, `upper_divisors` remains an empty list.

Let's break down the condition `i * i <= n`:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
- Therefore, `i * i` is 4.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 (since 4 <= n).

Since `n` is already given as a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, and `i * i` is 4, the condition `i * i <= n` will hold true for all values of `n` in the range 4 to 10^6. Therefore, no adjustment to `n` is necessary.

The other states (`lower_divisors` and `upper_divisors`) do not affect the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 2. If `n % 1 == 0`, then `lower_divisors` is [1]. If `1` is not equal to `n // 1`, then `upper_divisors` is [n]. Otherwise, `upper_divisors` remains an empty list.**
