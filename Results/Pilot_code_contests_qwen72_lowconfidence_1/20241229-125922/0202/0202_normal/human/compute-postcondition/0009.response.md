The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The conditions related to `n % i == 0` and `i != n // i` remain unchanged as they depend on the value of `i` before the increment. The lists `lower_divisors` and `upper_divisors` retain their values as defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 2. If `n % 1 == 0`, then `lower_divisors` is [1]. If `1` is not equal to `n // 1`, then `upper_divisors` is [n]. Otherwise, `upper_divisors` remains an empty list.**
