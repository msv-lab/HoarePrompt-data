To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the current state:

### Current State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
- `i` is 3.
- If `n % i == 0`, then `lower_divisors` is [1, 2].
- If `i` is not equal to `n // i`, then `upper_divisors` is [n, n // 2].
- Otherwise, `upper_divisors` is [n] if `1` is not equal to `n // 1`, or an empty list if `1` is equal to `n // 1`.
- If `n % i != 0`, then `lower_divisors` is [1] and `upper_divisors` is [n] if `1` is not equal to `n // 1`, or an empty list if `1` is equal to `n // 1`.

### Loop Condition:
- The loop condition is `i * i <= n`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition Check**: The loop will continue as long as `i * i <= n`.
2. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - Therefore, `i * i = 9`.
   - The condition `i * i <= n` becomes `9 <= n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 9.
- Since `n` is already given to be a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), we need to ensure that `n` is at least 9.

### Conclusion:
- No changes are needed to `n` because it is already within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
- No changes are needed to `i` because it is 3, and `i * i = 9` which is within the required range for the loop condition.

Thus, the state remains the same for the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 3. If `n % i == 0`, then `lower_divisors` is [1, 2]. If `i` is not equal to `n // i`, then `upper_divisors` is [n, n // 2]. Otherwise, `upper_divisors` is [n] if `1` is not equal to `n // 1`, or an empty list if `1` is equal to `n // 1`. If `n % i != 0`, then `lower_divisors` is [1] and `upper_divisors` is [n] if `1` is not equal to `n // 1`, or an empty list if `1` is equal to `n // 1`.**
