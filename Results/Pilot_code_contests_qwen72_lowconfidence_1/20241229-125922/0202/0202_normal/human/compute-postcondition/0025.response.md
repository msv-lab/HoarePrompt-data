Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and returns a list of all divisors of `n` in ascending order. The divisors are divided into two categories: `lower_divisors` (divisors less than or equal to the square root of `n`) and `upper_divisors` (divisors greater than the square root of `n`). If `n` is a perfect square, the square root is included only once in the list. The final list is constructed by concatenating `lower_divisors` with the reversed `upper_divisors`. This ensures that the returned list is sorted in ascending order. Edge cases include when `n` is a prime number (the list will contain only 1 and `n`), and when `n` is a perfect square (the square root is included only once). **
