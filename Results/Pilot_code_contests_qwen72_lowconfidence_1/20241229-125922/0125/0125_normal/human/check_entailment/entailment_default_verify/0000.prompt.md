You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A prime number is a natural number which has exactly two distinct natural number divisors: 1 and itself. For example, the first four prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5 and 7.

Write a program which reads a list of N integers and prints the number of prime numbers in the list.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10000

2 ≤ an element of the list ≤ 108

Input

The first line contains an integer N, the number of elements in the list.

N numbers are given in the following lines.

Output

Print the number of prime numbers in the given list.

Program:
```
n = int(raw_input())
cnt = 0
for i in range(n):
    num = int(raw_input())
    if func_1(num):
        cnt += 1
print(cnt)

def func_1(x):
    if 2 == x or 3 == x:
        return True
    if 0 == x % 2:
        return False
    for i in range(3, x):
        if x < i * i:
            break
        if 0 == x % i:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in the `func_1` function, specifically in the loop that checks for divisors. The loop condition `for i in range(3, x):` should be `for i in range(3, int(x**0.5) + 1, 2):`. This is because you only need to check up to the square root of `x`, and you can skip even numbers after checking for divisibility by 2. The current implementation will incorrectly identify some composite numbers as prime because it does not terminate the loop early enough.

For example, consider the number 9. The function will check divisibility by 3, but since the loop continues to 8, it will not terminate early, leading to an incorrect result. The correct implementation should stop checking once `i` exceeds the square root of `x`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(x):
    if x <= 1:
        return False
    if x <= 3:
        return True
    if x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(5, int(x**0.5) + 1, 6):
        if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This version efficiently checks for primality by only considering up to the square root of `x` and skipping unnecessary checks.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a single integer `x` (not a list) where \(2 \leq x \leq 10^8\). It returns `True` if `x` is a prime number, and `False` otherwise. The function performs the following checks:

1. If `x` is 2 or 3, it returns `True`.
2. If `x` is even, it returns `False`.
3. It iterates over odd numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of `x`. If any of these numbers divide `x` without a remainder, it returns `False`.

If none of the above conditions are met, the function concludes that `x` is a prime number and returns `True`.

Edge Cases:
- If `x` is 1, the function will incorrectly return `False` because 1 is not considered a prime number, but the function does not explicitly handle this case.
- The function assumes `x` is an integer within the specified range, but it does not validate this assumption. If `x` is outside the range or not an integer, the behavior is undefined.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
