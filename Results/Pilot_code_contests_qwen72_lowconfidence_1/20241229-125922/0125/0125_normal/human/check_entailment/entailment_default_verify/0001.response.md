Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the `func_1` function. The loop condition `x < i * i` causes the loop to break prematurely, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs, such as 9. The output hints confirm that the function should check up to the square root of `x`, but the current implementation does not do this correctly. The suggested correction in the original assessment, changing the loop condition to `i * i <= x`, would fix this issue. Therefore, the program as it stands does not meet the problem description and the output hints support the original assessment's conclusion that the program is incorrect.
