Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program is intended to count the number of prime numbers in a list of integers. However, there are several issues with the implementation of `func_1` that make the program incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Prime Check Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if a number is prime, but it has a logical error in the loop that iterates over possible divisors.
   - The loop `for i in range(3, x):` should actually be `for i in range(3, int(x**0.5) + 1, 2):` to efficiently check up to the square root of `x` and only consider odd numbers. The current loop can lead to unnecessary iterations and incorrect results for large values of `x`.

2. **Efficiency and Correctness**:
   - The condition `if x < i * i:` is redundant because the loop already stops at `x`. Instead, the loop should stop at `int(x**0.5) + 1` to ensure efficiency and correctness.
   - The loop should also increment by 2 to skip even numbers, as even numbers greater than 2 cannot be prime.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles small primes (2 and 3) and even numbers, but it fails to correctly identify larger primes due to the inefficient loop.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(x):
    if x <= 1:
        return False
    if x == 2 or x == 3:
        return True
    if x % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(x**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if x % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

With this corrected function, the program would correctly count the number of prime numbers in the input list, meeting the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.
