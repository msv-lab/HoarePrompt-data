Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the edge case where `x` is 1. According to the problem description, a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The function `func_1` does not explicitly check for the value 1, and since 1 is not a prime number, the function should return `False` for `x = 1`. However, the current implementation does not include this check, which means the program will incorrectly count 1 as a prime number if it appears in the input list. This violates the problem description and makes the program incorrect.
