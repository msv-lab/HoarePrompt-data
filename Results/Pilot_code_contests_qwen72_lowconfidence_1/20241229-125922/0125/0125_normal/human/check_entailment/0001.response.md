Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has an issue with the function `func_1` which checks if a number is prime. Specifically, the loop condition `x < i * i` is incorrect. This condition will break the loop prematurely, potentially missing some divisors. The correct condition should be `i * i <= x`. Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
5
2
3
4
5
9
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Actual Output:
```
4
```

In this case, the program incorrectly identifies 9 as a prime number because the loop breaks too early. The correct implementation of the prime-checking function should be:

```python
def func_1(x):
    if x == 2 or x == 3:
        return True
    if x % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(x**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if x % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This ensures that all potential divisors up to the square root of `x` are checked.
