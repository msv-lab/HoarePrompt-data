Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in the `func_1` function, specifically in the loop that checks for divisors. The loop condition `for i in range(3, x):` should be `for i in range(3, int(x**0.5) + 1, 2):`. This is because you only need to check up to the square root of `x`, and you can skip even numbers after checking for divisibility by 2. The current implementation will incorrectly identify some composite numbers as prime because it does not terminate the loop early enough.

For example, consider the number 9. The function will check divisibility by 3, but since the loop continues to 8, it will not terminate early, leading to an incorrect result. The correct implementation should stop checking once `i` exceeds the square root of `x`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(x):
    if x <= 1:
        return False
    if x <= 3:
        return True
    if x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(5, int(x**0.5) + 1, 6):
        if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This version efficiently checks for primality by only considering up to the square root of `x` and skipping unnecessary checks.
