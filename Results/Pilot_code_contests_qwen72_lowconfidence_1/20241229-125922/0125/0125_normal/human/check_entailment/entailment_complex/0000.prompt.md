You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A prime number is a natural number which has exactly two distinct natural number divisors: 1 and itself. For example, the first four prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5 and 7.

Write a program which reads a list of N integers and prints the number of prime numbers in the list.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10000

2 ≤ an element of the list ≤ 108

Input

The first line contains an integer N, the number of elements in the list.

N numbers are given in the following lines.

Output

Print the number of prime numbers in the given list.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
n = int(raw_input())
cnt = 0
for i in range(n):
    num = int(raw_input())
    if func_1(num):
        cnt += 1
print(cnt)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(x) ≤ 10000 and each element e in x satisfies 2 ≤ e ≤ 10^8.
def func_1(x):
    if (2 == x or 3 == x) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(x) ≤ 10000 and each element e in x satisfies 2 ≤ e ≤ 10^8, and neither 2 nor 3 is in x
    if (0 == x % 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(x) ≤ 10000 and each element e in x satisfies 2 ≤ e ≤ 10^8, and neither 2 nor 3 is in x. Additionally, there is no element in x that is divisible by 2.
    for i in range(3, x):
        if x < i * i:
            break
        
        if 0 == x % i:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(x) \leq 10000\) and each element \(e\) in \(x\) satisfies \(2 \leq e \leq 10^8\). Neither 2 nor 3 is in \(x\), and there is no element in \(x\) that is divisible by 2. If the loop executes, `max(x)` is either a prime number or the loop was broken because `max(x) < i * i` for some `i` in the range `[3, max(x))`. If the loop does not execute, `max(x) < 9`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single integer `x` (not a list) where \(2 \leq x \leq 10^8\). It returns `True` if `x` is a prime number, and `False` otherwise. The function performs the following checks:

1. If `x` is 2 or 3, it returns `True`.
2. If `x` is even, it returns `False`.
3. It iterates over odd numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of `x`. If any of these numbers divide `x` without a remainder, it returns `False`.

If none of the above conditions are met, the function concludes that `x` is a prime number and returns `True`.

Edge Cases:
- If `x` is 1, the function will incorrectly return `False` because 1 is not considered a prime number, but the function does not explicitly handle this case.
- The function assumes `x` is an integer within the specified range, but it does not validate this assumption. If `x` is outside the range or not an integer, the behavior is undefined.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
