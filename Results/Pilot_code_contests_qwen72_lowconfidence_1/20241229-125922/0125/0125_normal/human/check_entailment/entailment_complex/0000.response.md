**Correctness: False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Handling of the Number 1**: 
   - The problem description specifies that a prime number is a natural number with exactly two distinct natural number divisors: 1 and itself. However, the function `func_1` does not explicitly handle the case where `x` is 1. According to the definition of prime numbers, 1 is not a prime number. The function should return `False` for `x = 1`, but it currently does not check for this case.

2. **Efficiency of Prime Checking**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates over all odd numbers up to `x` to check for divisibility. This is inefficient and can be optimized. The function should iterate only up to the square root of `x` to determine if `x` is a prime number. The current implementation will work correctly, but it is not optimal and may lead to performance issues for large values of `x`.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. If the program is intended to run in Python 3, this would cause a runtime error.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is a corrected version of the function that addresses the issues mentioned:

```python
n = int(input())
cnt = 0
for i in range(n):
    num = int(input())
    if func_1(num):
        cnt += 1
print(cnt)

def func_1(x):
    if x == 1:
        return False
    if x == 2 or x == 3:
        return True
    if x % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(x**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if x % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Function:
1. **Handling of the Number 1**:
   - The function now explicitly checks if `x` is 1 and returns `False` in that case.

2. **Efficiency of Prime Checking**:
   - The function iterates only up to the square root of `x` using `int(x**0.5) + 1` to check for divisibility. This is more efficient and ensures that the function runs in a reasonable time for large values of `x`.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The function uses `input()` instead of `raw_input()` to ensure compatibility with Python 3.

With these corrections, the program will correctly count the number of prime numbers in the given list and meet the requirements of the problem description.
