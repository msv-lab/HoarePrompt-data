Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not fully adhere to the problem description, particularly in handling certain edge cases. Specifically:

1. **Handling of the Number 1**: The function `func_1` does not explicitly handle the case where the input number is 1. According to the definition of prime numbers, 1 is not considered a prime number. However, the function does not check for this and would incorrectly return `False` for 1, which is not the correct behavior as the function should return `False` for 1.

2. **Loop Termination Condition**: The loop in `func_1` iterates over odd numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of `x`. The condition `if x < i * i:` is used to break out of the loop early, but this condition is not necessary and can be simplified to `for i in range(3, int(x**0.5) + 1, 2):`. This ensures that the loop terminates correctly and efficiently.

3. **Input Validation**: While the problem description guarantees valid input, the function `func_1` does not validate that the input is within the specified range \(2 \leq x \leq 10^8\). Although this is not strictly required given the problem constraints, it is a good practice to ensure robustness.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, especially the handling of the number 1. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
