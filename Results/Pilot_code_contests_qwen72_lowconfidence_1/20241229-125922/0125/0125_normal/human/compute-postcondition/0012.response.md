Postcondition: **`x` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(x) ≤ 10000 and each element e in x satisfies 2 ≤ e ≤ 10^8, and neither 2 nor 3 is in x, and there is no element in x that is divisible by 2. `len(x)` is greater than 3. The current value of `x` is not less than `i * i`. Additionally, the current value of `x` is not divisible by `i`.**
