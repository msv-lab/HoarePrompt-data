The values of the variables do not change, but the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most immediate loop or conditional structure it is within. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(x) ≤ 10000 and each element e in x satisfies 2 ≤ e ≤ 10^8, and neither 2 nor 3 is in x, and there is no element in x that is divisible by 2. `len(x)` is greater than 3, and the current value of `x` is less than `i * i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
