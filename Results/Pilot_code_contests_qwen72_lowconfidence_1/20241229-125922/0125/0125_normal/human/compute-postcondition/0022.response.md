Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(x) ≤ 10000 and each element `e` in `x` satisfies 2 ≤ e ≤ 10^8, and neither 2 nor 3 is in `x`, and there is no element in `x` that is divisible by 2, `len(x)` is greater than 3, the current value of `x` is not less than `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`, the current value of `x` is not divisible by `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `x` is less than `i * i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `x % i == 0`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated value of `i` as `i + 1`.***
