Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(x) ≤ 10000 and each element e in x satisfies 2 ≤ e ≤ 10^8, and neither 2 nor 3 is in x, and there is no element in x that is divisible by 2. `len(x)` is greater than 3. If the current value of `x` is less than `i * i`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement following the if block.***
