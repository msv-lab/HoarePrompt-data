The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. It does not alter the values of any variables. Therefore, the only change in the output state is that the program breaks out of the loop or conditional statement.

Output State: **`x` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(x) ≤ 10000 and each element `e` in `x` satisfies 2 ≤ e ≤ 10^8, and neither 2 nor 3 is in `x`, and there is no element in `x` that is divisible by 2, `len(x)` is greater than 3, the current value of `x` is not less than `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`, the current value of `x` is not divisible by `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
