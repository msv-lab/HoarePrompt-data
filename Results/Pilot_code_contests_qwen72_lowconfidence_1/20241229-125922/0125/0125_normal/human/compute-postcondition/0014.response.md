The `break` statement causes the program to exit from the innermost loop or conditional block. Since the `break` statement is given without context regarding a loop or conditional block, we assume it is breaking out of such a structure. The values of the variables `x` and `i` remain unchanged by the `break` statement itself.

Output State: **`x` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(x) ≤ 10000 and each element `e` in `x` satisfies 2 ≤ e ≤ 10^8, and neither 2 nor 3 is in `x`, and there is no element in `x` that is divisible by 2. `len(x)` is greater than 3. The current value of `x` is not less than `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`. Additionally, the current value of `x` is not divisible by `i + 1`. `i` is `i + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
