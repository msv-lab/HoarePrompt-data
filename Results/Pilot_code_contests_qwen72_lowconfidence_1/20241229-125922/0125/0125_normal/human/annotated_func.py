    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(x) \leq 10000\) and each element \(e\) in \(x\) satisfies \(2 \leq e \leq 10^8\). Neither 2 nor 3 is in \(x\), and there is no element in \(x\) that is divisible by 2. If the loop executes, `max(x)` is either a prime number or the loop was broken because `max(x) < i * i` for some `i` in the range `[3, max(x))`. If the loop does not execute, `max(x) < 9`.

    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single integer `x` (not a list) where \(2 \leq x \leq 10^8\). It returns `True` if `x` is a prime number, and `False` otherwise. The function performs the following checks:

1. If `x` is 2 or 3, it returns `True`.
2. If `x` is even, it returns `False`.
3. It iterates over odd numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of `x`. If any of these numbers divide `x` without a remainder, it returns `False`.

If none of the above conditions are met, the function concludes that `x` is a prime number and returns `True`.

Edge Cases:
- If `x` is 1, the function will incorrectly return `False` because 1 is not considered a prime number, but the function does not explicitly handle this case.
- The function assumes `x` is an integer within the specified range, but it does not validate this assumption. If `x` is outside the range or not an integer, the behavior is undefined.
