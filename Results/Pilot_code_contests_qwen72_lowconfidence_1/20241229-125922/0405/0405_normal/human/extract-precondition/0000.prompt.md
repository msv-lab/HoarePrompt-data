You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Iahub recently has learned Bubble Sort, an algorithm that is used to sort a permutation with n elements a1, a2, ..., an in ascending order. He is bored of this so simple algorithm, so he invents his own graph. The graph (let's call it G) initially has n vertices and 0 edges. During Bubble Sort execution, edges appear as described in the following algorithm (pseudocode). 
    
    
      
    procedure bubbleSortGraph()  
        build a graph G with n vertices and 0 edges  
        repeat  
            swapped = false  
            for i = 1 to n - 1 inclusive do:  
                if a[i] > a[i + 1] then  
                    add an undirected edge in G between a[i] and a[i + 1]  
                    swap( a[i], a[i + 1] )  
                    swapped = true  
                end if  
            end for  
        until not swapped   
        /* repeat the algorithm as long as swapped value is true. */   
    end procedure  
    

For a graph, an independent set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent (so there are no edges between vertices of an independent set). A maximum independent set is an independent set which has maximum cardinality. Given the permutation, find the size of the maximum independent set of graph G, if we use such permutation as the premutation a in procedure bubbleSortGraph.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105). The next line contains n distinct integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ n).

Output

Output a single integer — the answer to the problem. 

Examples

Input

3
3 1 2


Output

2

Note

Consider the first example. Bubble sort swaps elements 3 and 1. We add edge (1, 3). Permutation is now [1, 3, 2]. Then bubble sort swaps elements 3 and 2. We add edge (2, 3). Permutation is now sorted. We have a graph with 3 vertices and 2 edges (1, 3) and (2, 3). Its maximal independent set is [1, 2].
