Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two lists, `lst1` and `lst2`, where each list contains distinct integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive). It returns a new list, `lst3`, which contains the common elements found in both `lst1` and `lst2`. The elements in `lst3` are also integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive). If there are no common elements between `lst1` and `lst2`, `lst3` will be an empty list. The order of elements in `lst3` is the same as their order in `lst1`. The original lists `lst1` and `lst2` remain unchanged. **

### Explanation:
- **Input Parameters**: `lst1` and `lst2` are lists of distinct integers between 1 and 9, with lengths between 1 and 9.
- **Output**: `lst3` is a list containing the common elements of `lst1` and `lst2`.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `lst1` and `lst2` have no common elements, `lst3` will be an empty list.
  - If either `lst1` or `lst2` is empty, `lst3` will also be an empty list.
  - The function preserves the order of elements as they appear in `lst1`.
- **Missing Functionality**: The function does not handle cases where the input lists contain non-integer values or integers outside the range of 1 to 9. However, based on the given constraints, such inputs are not expected.
