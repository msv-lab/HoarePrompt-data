The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `lst1` and `lst2`. Both `lst1` and `lst2` are lists of distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and 9 (inclusive), and both lists have lengths between 1 and 9 (inclusive). The function returns a list `lst3`, which contains the common elements found in both `lst1` and `lst2`. Each element in `lst3` is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), and `lst3` may contain zero or more elements depending on the overlap between `lst1` and `lst2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists `lst1` and `lst2` of distinct integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive) and returns a list `lst3` containing the common elements of `lst1` and `lst2`.**
