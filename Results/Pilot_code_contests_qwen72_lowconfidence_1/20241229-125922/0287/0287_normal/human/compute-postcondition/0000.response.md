The code creates a new list `lst3` that contains only the elements that are present in both `lst1` and `lst2`. The values of `lst1` and `lst2` remain unchanged. The length of `lst3` will be less than or equal to the lengths of `lst1` and `lst2`, and its elements will be those that are common to both `lst1` and `lst2`.

Output State: **`lst1` and `lst2` are lists of distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and 9 (inclusive), and both lists have lengths between 1 and 9 (inclusive); `lst3` is a list containing the common elements of `lst1` and `lst2`.**
