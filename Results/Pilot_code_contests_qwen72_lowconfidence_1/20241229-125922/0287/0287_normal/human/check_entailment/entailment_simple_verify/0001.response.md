Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap
- We are given two lists of non-zero digits.
- A pretty integer must contain at least one digit from each list.
- We need to find the smallest positive pretty integer.

### Original Program Analysis
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the sizes of the two lists and the lists themselves.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Intersection Check:**
   - The program checks if there is any common digit between the two lists using `func_1`.
   - If there is a common digit, it prints the smallest common digit.
   - This part is correct for the case where there is an intersection.

3. **No Intersection Case:**
   - If there is no common digit, the program finds the smallest digits from each list.
   - It then combines these smallest digits to form a two-digit number.
   - The program handles the case where the smallest digits from both lists are the same by printing just that digit.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the smallest digits from both lists are the same correctly. Specifically, it suggests that the program should always form a two-digit number by combining the smallest digits from each list to ensure the number is pretty.

### Annotated Code Analysis
- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `lst1` and `lst2` are lists of distinct integers between 1 and 9, with lengths between 1 and 9.
  - This is consistent with the problem description.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - Returns a list of common elements between `lst1` and `lst2`.
  - This is correct and matches the problem description.

- **Intersection Handling:**
  - If there is a common digit, the smallest common digit is printed.
  - This is correct and matches the problem description.

- **No Intersection Handling:**
  - The smallest digits from each list are found.
  - The program forms a two-digit number by combining these smallest digits.
  - If the smallest digits are the same, it prints just that digit.
  - This part is incorrect according to the original assessment because it should always form a two-digit number to ensure the number is pretty.

### Example Cases
1. **Input:**
   ```
   2 2
   1 3
   2 4
   ```
   - Expected Output: `12`
   - Actual Output: `12`
   - This is correct.

2. **Input:**
   ```
   2 2
   1 3
   7 9
   ```
   - Expected Output: `17`
   - Actual Output: `17`
   - This is correct.

3. **Input:**
   ```
   2 2
   1 3
   1 4
   ```
   - Expected Output: `11`
   - Actual Output: `1`
   - This is incorrect because `11` is a pretty number, but the program outputs `1`.

### Conclusion
The program is incorrect because it does not always form a two-digit number when the smallest digits from both lists are the same. This can lead to incorrect outputs in some cases, as shown in the third example.

Final: **False**
