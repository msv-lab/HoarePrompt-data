You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two lists of non-zero digits.

Let's call an integer pretty if its (base 10) representation has at least one digit from the first list and at least one digit from the second list. What is the smallest positive pretty integer?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 9) — the lengths of the first and the second lists, respectively.

The second line contains n distinct digits a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 9) — the elements of the first list.

The third line contains m distinct digits b1, b2, ..., bm (1 ≤ bi ≤ 9) — the elements of the second list.

Output

Print the smallest pretty integer.

Examples

Input

2 3
4 2
5 7 6


Output

25


Input

8 8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1


Output

1

Note

In the first example 25, 46, 24567 are pretty, as well as many other integers. The smallest among them is 25. 42 and 24 are not pretty because they don't have digits from the second list.

In the second example all integers that have at least one digit different from 9 are pretty. It's obvious that the smallest among them is 1, because it's the smallest positive integer.
Program:
```
(size1, size2) = map(int, raw_input().split())
lista1 = map(int, raw_input().split())
lista2 = map(int, raw_input().split())
intersec = func_1(lista1, lista2)
if len(intersec) > 0:
    menorInter = intersec[0]
    for i in range(len(intersec)):
        if intersec[i] < menorInter:
            menorInter = intersec[i]
    print(menorInter)
else:
    menor1 = lista1[0]
    for i in range(size1):
        if lista1[i] < menor1:
            menor1 = lista1[i]
    menor2 = lista2[0]
    for i in range(size2):
        if lista2[i] < menor2:
            menor2 = lista2[i]
    if menor1 == menor2:
        print(menor1)
    elif menor1 < menor2:
        print(str(menor1) + str(menor2))
    else:
        print(str(menor2) + str(menor1))

def func_1(lst1, lst2):
    lst3 = [value for value in lst1 if value in lst2]
    return lst3


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the intersection of the two lists is empty, but the smallest pretty integer can still be formed by combining the smallest digits from each list. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
Input:
2 2
1 3
2 4
```

Expected output:
```
12
```

However, the program will output:
```
12
```

This is correct in this case, but the program does not handle another important edge case correctly. Consider the following input:

```
Input:
2 2
1 3
7 9
```

Expected output:
```
17
```

However, the program will output:
```
17
```

While this output is also correct, the issue lies in how the program handles the smallest combination. The program assumes that if the smallest digits from both lists are the same, it prints just that digit. This assumption is incorrect and can lead to wrong outputs in some cases. For instance, if the smallest digits are the same, the program should still form a two-digit number by combining the next smallest digits from each list to ensure the number is pretty.

To fix this, the program should always form a two-digit number by combining the smallest digits from each list, ensuring that the result is always a pretty number.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two lists, `lst1` and `lst2`, where each list contains distinct integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive). It returns a new list, `lst3`, which contains the common elements found in both `lst1` and `lst2`. The elements in `lst3` are also integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive). If there are no common elements between `lst1` and `lst2`, `lst3` will be an empty list. The order of elements in `lst3` is the same as their order in `lst1`. The original lists `lst1` and `lst2` remain unchanged.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
