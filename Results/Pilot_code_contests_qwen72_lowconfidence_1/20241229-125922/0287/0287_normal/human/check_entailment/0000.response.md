Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where the intersection of the two lists is empty, but the smallest pretty integer should still be formed by the smallest digits from each list. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles the formation of the smallest two-digit number when the smallest digits from both lists are different.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2 2
1 3
2 4
```
Expected output:
```
12
```
However, the program will output `13` because it does not correctly form the smallest possible two-digit number from the smallest digits of each list. The correct logic should ensure that the smallest digit from the first list is placed before the smallest digit from the second list if they are different.
