Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there is no intersection between the two lists and the smallest digits from both lists are the same. According to the problem description, if the smallest digits from both lists are the same, the program should print that digit as the smallest pretty integer. However, the program incorrectly prints the digit twice in such a case.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2 2
1 2
2 3
```
The smallest digit from the first list is 1, and the smallest digit from the second list is 2. Since there is no intersection, the program should print "12". However, the program prints "2" because it incorrectly handles the case where the smallest digits are the same.

This issue makes the program incorrect for at least one potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
