You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two lists of non-zero digits.

Let's call an integer pretty if its (base 10) representation has at least one digit from the first list and at least one digit from the second list. What is the smallest positive pretty integer?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 9) — the lengths of the first and the second lists, respectively.

The second line contains n distinct digits a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 9) — the elements of the first list.

The third line contains m distinct digits b1, b2, ..., bm (1 ≤ bi ≤ 9) — the elements of the second list.

Output

Print the smallest pretty integer.

Examples

Input

2 3
4 2
5 7 6


Output

25


Input

8 8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1


Output

1

Note

In the first example 25, 46, 24567 are pretty, as well as many other integers. The smallest among them is 25. 42 and 24 are not pretty because they don't have digits from the second list.

In the second example all integers that have at least one digit different from 9 are pretty. It's obvious that the smallest among them is 1, because it's the smallest positive integer.
Program:
```
(size1, size2) = map(int, raw_input().split())
lista1 = map(int, raw_input().split())
lista2 = map(int, raw_input().split())
intersec = func_1(lista1, lista2)
if len(intersec) > 0:
    menorInter = intersec[0]
    for i in range(len(intersec)):
        if intersec[i] < menorInter:
            menorInter = intersec[i]
    print(menorInter)
else:
    menor1 = lista1[0]
    for i in range(size1):
        if lista1[i] < menor1:
            menor1 = lista1[i]
    menor2 = lista2[0]
    for i in range(size2):
        if lista2[i] < menor2:
            menor2 = lista2[i]
    if menor1 == menor2:
        print(menor1)
    elif menor1 < menor2:
        print(str(menor1) + str(menor2))
    else:
        print(str(menor2) + str(menor1))

def func_1(lst1, lst2):
    lst3 = [value for value in lst1 if value in lst2]
    return lst3


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two lists, `lst1` and `lst2`, where each list contains distinct integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive). It returns a new list, `lst3`, which contains the common elements found in both `lst1` and `lst2`. The elements in `lst3` are also integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive). If there are no common elements between `lst1` and `lst2`, `lst3` will be an empty list. The order of elements in `lst3` is the same as their order in `lst1`. The original lists `lst1` and `lst2` remain unchanged.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
