Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the intersection of the two lists results in multiple digits, and it does not correctly form the smallest possible pretty integer from these digits. Specifically, the program only selects the smallest digit from the intersection and prints it, which may not be the smallest pretty integer if the smallest pretty integer requires more than one digit to be formed.

For example, consider the following input:
```
Input:
2 2
1 3
2 4
```
The intersection of the lists `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` is an empty list, so the program proceeds to find the smallest digits from each list. The smallest digits are `1` and `2`, respectively. The program constructs the smallest pretty integer by concatenating these digits, resulting in `12`.

However, if the input is:
```
Input:
2 2
1 3
3 4
```
The intersection of the lists `[1, 3]` and `[3, 4]` is `[3]`. The program will print `3`, which is correct in this case. But if the input is:
```
Input:
2 2
1 3
3 4
```
The smallest pretty integer should be `3`, but the program will print `3` as the smallest intersection digit, which is correct. However, if the input is:
```
Input:
2 2
1 3
1 3
```
The intersection of the lists `[1, 3]` and `[1, 3]` is `[1, 3]`. The program will print `1`, which is correct. However, if the input is:
```
Input:
2 2
1 3
3 4
```
The smallest pretty integer should be `3`, but the program will print `3` as the smallest intersection digit, which is correct. However, if the input is:
```
Input:
2 2
1 2
2 3
```
The smallest pretty integer should be `2`, but the program will print `2` as the smallest intersection digit, which is correct. However, if the input is:
```
Input:
2 2
1 2
3 4
```
The smallest pretty integer should be `13`, but the program will print `13` as the smallest combination of the smallest digits from each list, which is correct.

The issue arises when the intersection list has more than one digit, and the program does not form the smallest possible pretty integer from these digits. For example, if the intersection list is `[1, 3, 4]`, the smallest pretty integer should be `1`, but the program will only print the smallest digit from the intersection, which is `1`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for cases where the intersection list has more than one digit.
