Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly follows the problem description and finds the smallest pretty integer according to the given requirements. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input as specified in the problem description. It takes two integers `size1` and `size2` which represent the lengths of the two lists of digits.
   - It then reads the two lists of digits, `lista1` and `lista2`.

2. **Finding Common Digits:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to find the intersection of the two lists (`lista1` and `lista2`). This is done using a list comprehension that checks for common elements.
   - If there are common digits, the program finds the smallest digit in the intersection and prints it. This is the smallest pretty integer if there is at least one common digit.

3. **Handling No Common Digits:**
   - If there are no common digits, the program finds the smallest digit from each list separately.
   - It then constructs the smallest possible pretty integer by combining the smallest digits from each list. The order of the digits is determined by comparing the smallest digits from each list to ensure the resulting number is the smallest possible.

4. **Output:**
   - If there is a common digit, the smallest common digit is printed.
   - If there are no common digits, the smallest digit from the first list followed by the smallest digit from the second list (or vice versa, depending on which is smaller) is printed.

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Case with Common Digits:**
  - If there is at least one common digit, the program correctly identifies the smallest common digit and prints it. This satisfies the requirement of finding the smallest pretty integer.

- **Case with No Common Digits:**
  - If there are no common digits, the program correctly identifies the smallest digits from each list and constructs the smallest possible pretty integer by combining these digits in the correct order. This ensures that the resulting number is the smallest possible pretty integer.

### Example Verification:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input:
    ```
    2 3
    4 2
    5 7 6
    ```
  - Output:
    ```
    25
    ```
  - Explanation: The smallest digits from `lista1` and `lista2` are 2 and 5, respectively. The smallest pretty integer is 25.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input:
    ```
    8 8
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
    8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
    ```
  - Output:
    ```
    1
    ```
  - Explanation: All digits are common, so the smallest common digit is 1.

The program handles all edge cases and inputs as described in the problem statement, ensuring that it always produces the correct output. Therefore, the program is correct.
