You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given two lists of non-zero digits.

Let's call an integer pretty if its (base 10) representation has at least one digit from the first list and at least one digit from the second list. What is the smallest positive pretty integer?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 9) — the lengths of the first and the second lists, respectively.

The second line contains n distinct digits a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 9) — the elements of the first list.

The third line contains m distinct digits b1, b2, ..., bm (1 ≤ bi ≤ 9) — the elements of the second list.

Output

Print the smallest pretty integer.

Examples

Input

2 3
4 2
5 7 6


Output

25


Input

8 8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1


Output

1

Note

In the first example 25, 46, 24567 are pretty, as well as many other integers. The smallest among them is 25. 42 and 24 are not pretty because they don't have digits from the second list.

In the second example all integers that have at least one digit different from 9 are pretty. It's obvious that the smallest among them is 1, because it's the smallest positive integer.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
(size1, size2) = map(int, raw_input().split())
lista1 = map(int, raw_input().split())
lista2 = map(int, raw_input().split())
intersec = func_1(lista1, lista2)
if len(intersec) > 0:
    menorInter = intersec[0]
    for i in range(len(intersec)):
        if intersec[i] < menorInter:
            menorInter = intersec[i]
    print(menorInter)
else:
    menor1 = lista1[0]
    for i in range(size1):
        if lista1[i] < menor1:
            menor1 = lista1[i]
    menor2 = lista2[0]
    for i in range(size2):
        if lista2[i] < menor2:
            menor2 = lista2[i]
    if menor1 == menor2:
        print(menor1)
    elif menor1 < menor2:
        print(str(menor1) + str(menor2))
    else:
        print(str(menor2) + str(menor1))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst1 and lst2 are lists of distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and 9 (inclusive), and both lists have lengths between 1 and 9 (inclusive).
def func_1(lst1, lst2):
    lst3 = [value for value in lst1 if value in lst2]
    return lst3
    #The program returns `lst3`, which is a list containing the common elements of `lst1` and `lst2`. Each element in `lst3` is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), and `lst3` may contain zero or more elements depending on the overlap between `lst1` and `lst2`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
