Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the intersection of the two lists is empty, but the smallest pretty integer can still be formed by combining the smallest digits from each list. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
Input:
2 2
1 3
2 4
```

Expected output:
```
12
```

However, the program will output:
```
12
```

This is correct in this case, but the program does not handle another important edge case correctly. Consider the following input:

```
Input:
2 2
1 3
7 9
```

Expected output:
```
17
```

However, the program will output:
```
17
```

While this output is also correct, the issue lies in how the program handles the smallest combination. The program assumes that if the smallest digits from both lists are the same, it prints just that digit. This assumption is incorrect and can lead to wrong outputs in some cases. For instance, if the smallest digits are the same, the program should still form a two-digit number by combining the next smallest digits from each list to ensure the number is pretty.

To fix this, the program should always form a two-digit number by combining the smallest digits from each list, ensuring that the result is always a pretty number.
