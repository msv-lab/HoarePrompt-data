Final: **False**

### Reasoning:

1. **Intersection Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where there is an intersection between the two lists (`intersec`). It finds the smallest common digit and prints it, which is correct according to the problem description.

2. **No Intersection Handling:**
   - When there is no intersection (`len(intersec) == 0`), the program attempts to find the smallest digits from each list and combines them. However, the logic here is flawed:
     - If the smallest digits from both lists are the same (`menor1 == menor2`), the program prints just that digit. This is incorrect because the problem requires the smallest positive pretty integer, which must have at least one digit from each list.
     - For example, consider the input:
       ```
       Input:
       2 2
       1 3
       7 9
       ```
       The expected output is `17`, but the program will output `1` because it incorrectly prints the smallest digit instead of forming a two-digit number.

3. **Combining Smallest Digits:**
   - The program should always form a two-digit number by combining the smallest digits from each list to ensure the result is a pretty number. This ensures that the number has at least one digit from each list, meeting the problem's requirements.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program fails to handle the edge case where the smallest digits from both lists are the same. It should form a two-digit number by combining the next smallest digits from each list to ensure the number is pretty.

Given these issues, the program does not fully meet the problem description, particularly in handling the case where the smallest digits from both lists are the same. Therefore, the original assessment of **False** is accurate.
