The function `func_1` accepts two lists, `lst1` and `lst2`, where each list contains distinct integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive). It returns a new list, `lst3`, which contains the common elements found in both `lst1` and `lst2`. The elements in `lst3` are also integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive). If there are no common elements between `lst1` and `lst2`, `lst3` will be an empty list. The order of elements in `lst3` is the same as their order in `lst1`. The original lists `lst1` and `lst2` remain unchanged.
