Precondition: **n and q are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000. Each event is represented as a tuple (typei, xi or ti), where typei is an integer (1 ≤ typei ≤ 3) indicating the type of the event, and xi or ti are integers (1 ≤ xi ≤ n, 1 ≤ ti ≤ q) depending on the event type. Initially, there are no notifications.**
