You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Thor is getting used to the Earth. As a gift Loki gave him a smartphone. There are n applications on this phone. Thor is fascinated by this phone. He has only one minor issue: he can't count the number of unread notifications generated by those applications (maybe Loki put a curse on it so he can't).

q events are about to happen (in chronological order). They are of three types:

  1. Application x generates a notification (this new notification is unread). 
  2. Thor reads all notifications generated so far by application x (he may re-read some notifications). 
  3. Thor reads the first t notifications generated by phone applications (notifications generated in first t events of the first type). It's guaranteed that there were at least t events of the first type before this event. Please note that he doesn't read first t unread notifications, he just reads the very first t notifications generated on his phone and he may re-read some of them in this operation. 



Please help Thor and tell him the number of unread notifications after each event. You may assume that initially there are no notifications in the phone.

Input

The first line of input contains two integers n and q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300 000) — the number of applications and the number of events to happen.

The next q lines contain the events. The i-th of these lines starts with an integer typei — type of the i-th event. If typei = 1 or typei = 2 then it is followed by an integer xi. Otherwise it is followed by an integer ti (1 ≤ typei ≤ 3, 1 ≤ xi ≤ n, 1 ≤ ti ≤ q).

Output

Print the number of unread notifications after each event.

Note

In the first sample:

  1. Application 3 generates a notification (there is 1 unread notification). 
  2. Application 1 generates a notification (there are 2 unread notifications). 
  3. Application 2 generates a notification (there are 3 unread notifications). 
  4. Thor reads the notification generated by application 3, there are 2 unread notifications left. 



In the second sample test:

  1. Application 2 generates a notification (there is 1 unread notification). 
  2. Application 4 generates a notification (there are 2 unread notifications). 
  3. Application 2 generates a notification (there are 3 unread notifications). 
  4. Thor reads first three notifications and since there are only three of them so far, there will be no unread notification left. 
  5. Application 3 generates a notification (there is 1 unread notification). 
  6. Application 3 generates a notification (there are 2 unread notifications). 
Program:
```
import sys
import math
import bisect

def func():
    (n, q) = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))
    notifications = []
    unread = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
    last_unread = 0
    ans = 0
    for q0 in range(q):
        (i, x) = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))
        if i == 1:
            unread[x] += 1
            ans += 1
            notifications.append(x)
        elif i == 2:
            ans -= unread[x]
            unread[x] = 0
        else:
            for j in range(last_unread, x):
                unread[notifications[j]] -= 1
                ans -= 1
            last_unread = x
        print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the third type of event (Thor reads the first t notifications) correctly. Specifically, the loop that processes the first `t` notifications does not account for the possibility that `t` might be greater than the number of notifications currently in the `notifications` list. This can lead to an index out of range error or incorrect behavior.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 4
1 1
1 2
1 3
3 5
```

After the first three events, the `notifications` list will be `[1, 2, 3]`. When the fourth event occurs (`3 5`), the program will attempt to read the first 5 notifications. However, there are only 3 notifications in the list, so the loop:
```python
for j in range(last_unread, x):
    unread[notifications[j]] -= 1
    ans -= 1
```
will attempt to access `notifications[3]`, `notifications[4]`, and `notifications[5]`, which do not exist. This will result in an `IndexError`.

To fix this, the loop should only iterate up to the length of the `notifications` list:
```python
for j in range(last_unread, min(x, len(notifications))):
    unread[notifications[j]] -= 1
    ans -= 1
```

This ensures that the program does not attempt to access indices beyond the current length of the `notifications` list.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

import bisect

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000. Each event is represented as a tuple (typei, xi or ti), where typei is an integer (1 ≤ typei ≤ 3) indicating the type of the event, and xi or ti are integers (1 ≤ xi ≤ n, 1 ≤ ti ≤ q) depending on the event type. Initially, there are no notifications.
def func():
    n, q = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))
    notifications = []
    unread = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    last_unread = 0
    ans = 0
    for q0 in range(q):
        i, x = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))
        
        if i == 1:
            unread[x] += 1
            ans += 1
            notifications.append(x)
        elif i == 2:
            ans -= unread[x]
            unread[x] = 0
        else:
            for j in range(last_unread, x):
                unread[notifications[j]] -= 1
                ans -= 1
            last_unread = x
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000, `notifications` is a list containing the indices `x` for which `i == 1` was encountered, `unread` is a list of length `n + 1` representing the number of unread notifications for each index, `last_unread` is the last value of `x` for which `i == 3` was encountered or 0 if no such operation occurred, `ans` is the final count of unread notifications.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
