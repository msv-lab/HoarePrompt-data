Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed explanation of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of applications `n` and the number of events `q`.
   - It initializes an empty list `notifications` to keep track of the notifications generated.
   - It initializes a list `unread` of size `n + 1` to keep track of the number of unread notifications for each application.
   - It initializes `last_unread` to 0 to keep track of the last notification read by Thor.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0 to keep track of the total number of unread notifications.

2. **Processing Events:**
   - For each event, the program reads the event type `i` and the corresponding value `x` (either `xi` or `ti`).
   - If the event type is 1 (application `x` generates a notification):
     - It increments the unread count for application `x`.
     - It increments the total unread count `ans`.
     - It appends the application index `x` to the `notifications` list.
   - If the event type is 2 (Thor reads all notifications from application `x`):
     - It subtracts the unread count for application `x` from the total unread count `ans`.
     - It sets the unread count for application `x` to 0.
   - If the event type is 3 (Thor reads the first `x` notifications):
     - It iterates from `last_unread` to `x` and decrements the unread count for each notification in the `notifications` list.
     - It subtracts 1 from the total unread count `ans` for each notification read.
     - It updates `last_unread` to `x`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing each event, the program prints the current number of unread notifications (`ans`).

The program correctly handles all three types of events and maintains the state of unread notifications accurately. It ensures that the number of unread notifications is updated correctly after each event, and it prints the correct number of unread notifications after each event. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
