You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Thor is getting used to the Earth. As a gift Loki gave him a smartphone. There are n applications on this phone. Thor is fascinated by this phone. He has only one minor issue: he can't count the number of unread notifications generated by those applications (maybe Loki put a curse on it so he can't).

q events are about to happen (in chronological order). They are of three types:

  1. Application x generates a notification (this new notification is unread). 
  2. Thor reads all notifications generated so far by application x (he may re-read some notifications). 
  3. Thor reads the first t notifications generated by phone applications (notifications generated in first t events of the first type). It's guaranteed that there were at least t events of the first type before this event. Please note that he doesn't read first t unread notifications, he just reads the very first t notifications generated on his phone and he may re-read some of them in this operation. 



Please help Thor and tell him the number of unread notifications after each event. You may assume that initially there are no notifications in the phone.

Input

The first line of input contains two integers n and q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300 000) — the number of applications and the number of events to happen.

The next q lines contain the events. The i-th of these lines starts with an integer typei — type of the i-th event. If typei = 1 or typei = 2 then it is followed by an integer xi. Otherwise it is followed by an integer ti (1 ≤ typei ≤ 3, 1 ≤ xi ≤ n, 1 ≤ ti ≤ q).

Output

Print the number of unread notifications after each event.

Note

In the first sample:

  1. Application 3 generates a notification (there is 1 unread notification). 
  2. Application 1 generates a notification (there are 2 unread notifications). 
  3. Application 2 generates a notification (there are 3 unread notifications). 
  4. Thor reads the notification generated by application 3, there are 2 unread notifications left. 



In the second sample test:

  1. Application 2 generates a notification (there is 1 unread notification). 
  2. Application 4 generates a notification (there are 2 unread notifications). 
  3. Application 2 generates a notification (there are 3 unread notifications). 
  4. Thor reads first three notifications and since there are only three of them so far, there will be no unread notification left. 
  5. Application 3 generates a notification (there is 1 unread notification). 
  6. Application 3 generates a notification (there are 2 unread notifications). 
Program:
```
import sys
import math
import bisect

def func():
    (n, q) = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))
    notifications = []
    unread = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
    last_unread = 0
    ans = 0
    for q0 in range(q):
        (i, x) = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))
        if i == 1:
            unread[x] += 1
            ans += 1
            notifications.append(x)
        elif i == 2:
            ans -= unread[x]
            unread[x] = 0
        else:
            for j in range(last_unread, x):
                unread[notifications[j]] -= 1
                ans -= 1
            last_unread = x
        print(ans)


```
Output hints: The function `func` processes a series of events represented as tuples `(typei, xi or ti)`. It maintains a list of notifications and a count of unread notifications for each index. The function supports three types of events:
1.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
