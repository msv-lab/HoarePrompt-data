You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Thor is getting used to the Earth. As a gift Loki gave him a smartphone. There are n applications on this phone. Thor is fascinated by this phone. He has only one minor issue: he can't count the number of unread notifications generated by those applications (maybe Loki put a curse on it so he can't).

q events are about to happen (in chronological order). They are of three types:

  1. Application x generates a notification (this new notification is unread). 
  2. Thor reads all notifications generated so far by application x (he may re-read some notifications). 
  3. Thor reads the first t notifications generated by phone applications (notifications generated in first t events of the first type). It's guaranteed that there were at least t events of the first type before this event. Please note that he doesn't read first t unread notifications, he just reads the very first t notifications generated on his phone and he may re-read some of them in this operation. 



Please help Thor and tell him the number of unread notifications after each event. You may assume that initially there are no notifications in the phone.

Input

The first line of input contains two integers n and q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300 000) — the number of applications and the number of events to happen.

The next q lines contain the events. The i-th of these lines starts with an integer typei — type of the i-th event. If typei = 1 or typei = 2 then it is followed by an integer xi. Otherwise it is followed by an integer ti (1 ≤ typei ≤ 3, 1 ≤ xi ≤ n, 1 ≤ ti ≤ q).

Output

Print the number of unread notifications after each event.

Note

In the first sample:

  1. Application 3 generates a notification (there is 1 unread notification). 
  2. Application 1 generates a notification (there are 2 unread notifications). 
  3. Application 2 generates a notification (there are 3 unread notifications). 
  4. Thor reads the notification generated by application 3, there are 2 unread notifications left. 



In the second sample test:

  1. Application 2 generates a notification (there is 1 unread notification). 
  2. Application 4 generates a notification (there are 2 unread notifications). 
  3. Application 2 generates a notification (there are 3 unread notifications). 
  4. Thor reads first three notifications and since there are only three of them so far, there will be no unread notification left. 
  5. Application 3 generates a notification (there is 1 unread notification). 
  6. Application 3 generates a notification (there are 2 unread notifications). 
Program:
```
import sys
import math
import bisect

def func():
    (n, q) = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))
    notifications = []
    unread = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
    last_unread = 0
    ans = 0
    for q0 in range(q):
        (i, x) = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))
        if i == 1:
            unread[x] += 1
            ans += 1
            notifications.append(x)
        elif i == 2:
            ans -= unread[x]
            unread[x] = 0
        else:
            for j in range(last_unread, x):
                unread[notifications[j]] -= 1
                ans -= 1
            last_unread = x
        print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program fails to handle the third type of event correctly. Specifically, the loop in the `else` block iterates from `last_unread` to `x`, but it should iterate from `last_unread` to `min(last_unread + x, len(notifications))`. This is because the third type of event specifies that Thor reads the first `t` notifications, not the next `t` notifications starting from `last_unread`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 6
1 2
1 4
1 2
3 3
1 3
1 3
```

The expected output is:
```
1
2
3
0
1
2
```

However, the program will produce:
```
1
2
3
1
2
3
```

This is because the program incorrectly decrements the unread count for the first three notifications starting from `last_unread` instead of reading the first three notifications in total. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func` processes a series of events represented as tuples `(typei, xi or ti)`. It maintains a list of notifications and a count of unread notifications for each index. The function supports three types of events:
1.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
