Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Let's break down how the program meets each requirement:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes the variables `n` and `q` from the input, which represent the number of applications and the number of events, respectively.
   - It also initializes `notifications` as an empty list to keep track of the notifications generated by applications.
   - `unread` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to zero, which keeps track of the number of unread notifications for each application.
   - `last_unread` is initialized to 0, which keeps track of the last index of the first type of event that has been read.
   - `ans` is initialized to 0, which keeps track of the total number of unread notifications.

2. **Processing Events**:
   - The program processes each event in a loop.
   - For each event, it reads the type of the event (`i`) and the corresponding value (`x`).
   - **Type 1 Event**: When `i == 1`, the program increments the number of unread notifications for application `x` and appends `x` to the `notifications` list. It also increments the total number of unread notifications (`ans`).
   - **Type 2 Event**: When `i == 2`, the program sets the number of unread notifications for application `x` to zero and subtracts this number from the total unread notifications (`ans`).
   - **Type 3 Event**: When `i == 3`, the program iterates from `last_unread` to `x` and decrements the number of unread notifications for each application in the `notifications` list up to the `x`-th event. It also decrements the total number of unread notifications (`ans`). Finally, it updates `last_unread` to `x`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing each event, the program prints the current number of unread notifications (`ans`).

### Verification:

- **Type 1 Event**: The program correctly adds a new notification and updates the count of unread notifications.
- **Type 2 Event**: The program correctly marks all notifications from a specific application as read and updates the count of unread notifications.
- **Type 3 Event**: The program correctly marks the first `t` notifications as read and updates the count of unread notifications.

The program handles all edge cases and ensures that the number of unread notifications is updated correctly after each event. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
