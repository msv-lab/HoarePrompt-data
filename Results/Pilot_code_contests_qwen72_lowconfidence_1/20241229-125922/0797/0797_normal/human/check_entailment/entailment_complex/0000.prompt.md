You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Thor is getting used to the Earth. As a gift Loki gave him a smartphone. There are n applications on this phone. Thor is fascinated by this phone. He has only one minor issue: he can't count the number of unread notifications generated by those applications (maybe Loki put a curse on it so he can't).

q events are about to happen (in chronological order). They are of three types:

  1. Application x generates a notification (this new notification is unread). 
  2. Thor reads all notifications generated so far by application x (he may re-read some notifications). 
  3. Thor reads the first t notifications generated by phone applications (notifications generated in first t events of the first type). It's guaranteed that there were at least t events of the first type before this event. Please note that he doesn't read first t unread notifications, he just reads the very first t notifications generated on his phone and he may re-read some of them in this operation. 



Please help Thor and tell him the number of unread notifications after each event. You may assume that initially there are no notifications in the phone.

Input

The first line of input contains two integers n and q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300 000) — the number of applications and the number of events to happen.

The next q lines contain the events. The i-th of these lines starts with an integer typei — type of the i-th event. If typei = 1 or typei = 2 then it is followed by an integer xi. Otherwise it is followed by an integer ti (1 ≤ typei ≤ 3, 1 ≤ xi ≤ n, 1 ≤ ti ≤ q).

Output

Print the number of unread notifications after each event.

Note

In the first sample:

  1. Application 3 generates a notification (there is 1 unread notification). 
  2. Application 1 generates a notification (there are 2 unread notifications). 
  3. Application 2 generates a notification (there are 3 unread notifications). 
  4. Thor reads the notification generated by application 3, there are 2 unread notifications left. 



In the second sample test:

  1. Application 2 generates a notification (there is 1 unread notification). 
  2. Application 4 generates a notification (there are 2 unread notifications). 
  3. Application 2 generates a notification (there are 3 unread notifications). 
  4. Thor reads first three notifications and since there are only three of them so far, there will be no unread notification left. 
  5. Application 3 generates a notification (there is 1 unread notification). 
  6. Application 3 generates a notification (there are 2 unread notifications). 
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys
import math
import bisect

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000. Each event is represented as a tuple (typei, xi or ti), where typei is an integer (1 ≤ typei ≤ 3) indicating the type of the event, and xi or ti are integers (1 ≤ xi ≤ n, 1 ≤ ti ≤ q) depending on the event type. Initially, there are no notifications.
def func():
    n, q = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))
    notifications = []
    unread = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    last_unread = 0
    ans = 0
    for q0 in range(q):
        i, x = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))
        
        if i == 1:
            unread[x] += 1
            ans += 1
            notifications.append(x)
        elif i == 2:
            ans -= unread[x]
            unread[x] = 0
        else:
            for j in range(last_unread, x):
                unread[notifications[j]] -= 1
                ans -= 1
            last_unread = x
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000, `notifications` is a list containing the indices `x` for which `i == 1` was encountered, `unread` is a list of length `n + 1` representing the number of unread notifications for each index, `last_unread` is the last value of `x` for which `i == 3` was encountered or 0 if no such operation occurred, `ans` is the final count of unread notifications.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of events represented as tuples `(typei, xi or ti)`. It maintains a list of notifications and a count of unread notifications for each index. The function supports three types of events:
1.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
