Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program fails to handle the third type of event correctly. Specifically, the loop in the `else` block iterates from `last_unread` to `x`, but it should iterate from `last_unread` to `min(last_unread + x, len(notifications))`. This is because the third type of event specifies that Thor reads the first `t` notifications, not the next `t` notifications starting from `last_unread`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 6
1 2
1 4
1 2
3 3
1 3
1 3
```

The expected output is:
```
1
2
3
0
1
2
```

However, the program will produce:
```
1
2
3
1
2
3
```

This is because the program incorrectly decrements the unread count for the first three notifications starting from `last_unread` instead of reading the first three notifications in total. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
