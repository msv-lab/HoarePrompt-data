The value of `ans` is decremented by the value of `unread[x]`. Since `x` is a specific integer read from the input, and `unread` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`, the value of `unread[x]` is 0. Therefore, `ans` remains unchanged because subtracting 0 does not affect its value.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000, `n` and `q` have been assigned specific values from the input, `notifications` is an empty list, `unread` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`, `last_unread` is 0, `ans` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `q0` is 0, `i` and `x` are specific integers read from the input, and `i` is 2**
