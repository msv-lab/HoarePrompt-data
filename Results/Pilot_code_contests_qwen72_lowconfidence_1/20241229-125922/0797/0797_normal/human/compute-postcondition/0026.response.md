The code snippet `last_unread = x` updates the value of `last_unread` to the value of `x`. This change affects the state of the program. Here’s the updated state:

- `n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000, and they have specific values.
- `notifications` is a list with at least `x` elements.
- `unread` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` except `unread[notifications[j]]` is decremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `[last_unread, x)`.
- `last_unread` is now `x`.
- `ans` is `ans - (x - last_unread)`.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `q0` is 0.
- `i` and `x` are specific integers read from the input, `i` is not equal to 2, and `x` is greater than or equal to `last_unread`.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000, `n` and `q` have specific values, `notifications` is a list with at least `x` elements, `unread` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` except `unread[notifications[j]]` is decremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `[last_unread, x)`, `last_unread` is `x`, `ans` is `ans - (x - last_unread)`, `q` is greater than 0, `q0` is 0, `i` and `x` are specific integers read from the input, `i` is not equal to 2, `x` is greater than or equal to `last_unread`.**
