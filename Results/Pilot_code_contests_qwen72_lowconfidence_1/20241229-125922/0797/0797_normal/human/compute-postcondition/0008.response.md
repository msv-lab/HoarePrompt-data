The code snippet `unread[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the `unread` list by 1.

- The value at `unread[x]` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000, `n` and `q` have been assigned specific values from the input, `notifications` is an empty list, `unread` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` except `unread[x]` which is now 1, `last_unread` is 0, `ans` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `q0` is 0, `i` and `x` are specific integers read from the input. The current value of `i` is 1.**
