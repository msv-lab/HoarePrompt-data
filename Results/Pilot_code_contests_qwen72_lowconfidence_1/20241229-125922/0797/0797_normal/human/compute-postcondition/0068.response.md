The line of code `last_unread = x` updates the value of `last_unread` to the current value of `x`. This change impacts the tracking of unread notifications, specifically the range from which notifications will be considered as read in future operations.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `q` are positive integers within the specified range.
- `notifications` is a list that may contain elements.
- `unread` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`, with potential changes based on the value of `i`.
- `last_unread` was previously set to some value.
- `x` is the last value read from the input.
- `ans` is calculated based on `x` and `last_unread`.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `q0` is 2.
- `i` and `x` are updated to new values from the input.
- `x` is greater than or equal to `last_unread` if `i` is not 2.
- `unread[notifications[j]]` is decremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[last_unread, x)`.

After executing `last_unread = x`:
- `last_unread` is now equal to the current value of `x`.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000, `n` and `q` have been assigned specific values from the input, `notifications` is a list that is either empty or contains `[x]` (if `i` is 1, `notifications` contains `[x]` or `[... x]` if initially contained `[x]`), `unread` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` except `unread[x]` is 1 if `i` is 1, or `unread[x]` is 0 if `i` is 2, or `unread[notifications[j]]` is decremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `[last_unread, x)` if `i` is not 1 or 2, `last_unread` is `x`, `x` is the last value read from the input, `ans` is `ans - (x - last_unread)`, `q` is greater than 0, `q0` is 2, `i` and `x` are updated to the values read from the input, `x` is greater than or equal to `last_unread` if `i` is not 2, `unread[notifications[j]]` is decremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[last_unread, x)`.**
