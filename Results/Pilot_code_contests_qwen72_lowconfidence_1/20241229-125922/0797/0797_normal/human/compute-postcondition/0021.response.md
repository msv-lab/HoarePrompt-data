The code snippet `ans -= 1` decrements the value of `ans` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000.
- `n` and `q` have specific values.
- `notifications` is an empty list.
- `unread` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` except `unread[k]` is -1 where `k` is the value of `notifications[1]`.
- `last_unread` is 0.
- `ans` is `ans - 1`.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `q0` is 0.
- `i` and `x` are specific integers read from the input.
- `i` is not equal to 2.
- `x` is greater than 0.
- `j` is `last_unread + 1` (which is 1).

After executing `ans -= 1`:
- The value of `ans` is decremented by 1.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000.
- `n` and `q` have specific values.
- `notifications` is an empty list.
- `unread` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` except `unread[k]` is -1 where `k` is the value of `notifications[1]`.
- `last_unread` is 0.
- `ans` is `ans - 1` (decremented by 1).
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `q0` is 0.
- `i` and `x` are specific integers read from the input.
- `i` is not equal to 2.
- `x` is greater than 0.
- `j` is `last_unread + 1` (which is 1).

Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000, `n` and `q` have specific values, `notifications` is an empty list, `unread` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` except `unread[k]` is -1 where `k` is the value of `notifications[1]`, `last_unread` is 0, `ans` is `ans - 1` (decremented by 1), `q` is greater than 0, `q0` is 0, `i` and `x` are specific integers read from the input, `i` is not equal to 2, `x` is greater than 0, `j` is `last_unread + 1` (which is 1).**
