The code `ans -= 1` decrements the value of `ans` by 1. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000, `notifications` is a list that is either empty or contains `[x]`, `unread[notifications[j]]` is decremented by 1, `last_unread` is `last_unread + 1`, `ans` is `ans - 1`, `q` is greater than 0, `q0` is 1, `i` is 1 or not 1, `x` is greater than or equal to `last_unread` if `i` is not 2, and `last_unread` must be less than `x`.**
