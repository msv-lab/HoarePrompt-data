Postcondition: ***`n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000, `n` and `q` have been assigned specific values from the input. `notifications` is a list that is either empty or contains `[x]` (if `i` is 1, `notifications` contains `[x]` or `[... x]` if initially contained `[x]`). `unread` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` except `unread[x]` is 1 if `i` is 1, or `unread[x]` is 0 if `i` is 2, or `unread[notifications[j]]` is decremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `[last_unread, x)` if `i` is not 1 or 2. If `i` is 1, `unread[x]` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is incremented by 1. If `i` is 2, `ans` is decremented by `unread[x]`, and `last_unread` is set to 0. If `i` is not 1 or 2, `ans` is decremented by `(x - last_unread)`, and `unread[notifications[j]]` is decremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[last_unread, x)`. `last_unread` is set to `x` if `i` is not 2. `q` is greater than 0, `q0` is 2, and `i` and `x` are updated to the values read from the input, with `x` being greater than or equal to `last_unread` if `i` is not 2.***
