The value of `x` is appended to the list `notifications`. The initial state specifies that `notifications` is either empty or contains `[x]` if `i` is 1, or contains `[... x]` if it initially contained `[x]`.

- If `notifications` was empty, it now contains `[x]`.
- If `notifications` already contained `[x]`, it now contains `[x, x]`.
- If `notifications` contained `[... x]`, it now contains `[... x, x]`.

The rest of the variables (`n`, `q`, `unread`, `last_unread`, `ans`, `q0`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000, `n` and `q` have been assigned specific values from the input, `notifications` contains `[x]` or `[... x, x]`, `unread` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` except `unread[x]` is 1 if `i` is 1, or `unread[x]` is 0 if `i` is 2, or `unread[notifications[j]]` is decremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `[last_unread, x)` if `i` is not 1 or 2, `unread[x]` is incremented by 1, `last_unread` is 0 if `i` is 2, or `x` if `i` is not 2, `ans` is incremented by 1, `q` is greater than 0, `q0` is 2, `i` and `x` are specific integers read from the input, `i` is 1 or not 1, and `x` is greater than or equal to `last_unread` if `i` is not 2, `i` and `x` are updated to the values read from the input.**
