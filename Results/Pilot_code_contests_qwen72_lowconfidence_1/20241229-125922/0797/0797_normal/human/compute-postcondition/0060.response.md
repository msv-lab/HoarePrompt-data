The line of code `ans -= 1` decrements the value of `ans` by 1. The exact value of `ans` before the decrement is not specified, but we know it will be reduced by 1.

Therefore, the output state is:

**`n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000, `n` and `q` have been assigned specific values from the input, `notifications` is a list that is either empty or contains `[x]` (if `i` is 1, `notifications` contains `[x]` or `[... x]` if initially contained `[x]`), `unread` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` except `unread[x]` is 1 if `i` is 1, or `unread[x]` is 0 if `i` is 2, or `unread[notifications[j]]` is decremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `[last_unread, x)` if `i` is not 1 or 2, `last_unread` is 0, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is `ans - 1`, `q` is greater than 0, `q0` is 2, `i` is 2, and `x` is greater than or equal to `last_unread` if `i` is not 2, `i` and `x` are updated to the values read from the input.**
