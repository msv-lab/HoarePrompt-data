Postcondition: ***`n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000, `n` and `q` have been assigned specific values from the input, `notifications` is a list that is either empty or contains `[x]` (if `i` is 1, `notifications` contains `[x]` or `[... x]` if initially contained `[x]`), `unread` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` except `unread[x]` is 0 if `i` is 2, or `unread[x]` is 1 if `i` is 1, or `unread[notifications[j]]` is decremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `[last_unread, x)` if `i` is not 1 or 2, `last_unread` is 0 if `i` is 2, or `x` if `i` is not 2, `ans` is `ans - unread[x]` if `i` is 2, or `ans` is `ans - (x - last_unread)` if `i` is not 2, `q` is greater than 0, `q0` is 2, `i` and `x` are updated to the values read from the input, `x` is greater than or equal to `last_unread` if `i` is not 2, `unread[notifications[j]]` is decremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[last_unread, x)`.***
