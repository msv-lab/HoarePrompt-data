The code snippet `ans -= 1` decrements the value of `ans` by 1. This operation only affects the `ans` variable.

- The value of `ans` is decremented by 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `q`, `notifications`, `last_unread`, `unread`, `q0`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000, `notifications` is a list that is either empty or contains `[x]`, `unread` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` except `unread[x]` is 1 if `i` is 1, or `unread[x]` is 0 if `i` is 2, or `unread[notifications[j]]` is decremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `[last_unread, x)` if `i` is not 1 or 2, `last_unread` is 0, `x` is updated to the next value read from the input and must be greater than 0, `ans` is `ans - 1`, `q` is greater than 0, `q0` is 2, `i` is updated to the next value read from the input, `x` is greater than or equal to `last_unread` if `i` is not 2, `unread[notifications[j]]` is decremented by 1.**

Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000, `notifications` is a list that is either empty or contains `[x]`, `unread` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` except `unread[x]` is 1 if `i` is 1, or `unread[x]` is 0 if `i` is 2, or `unread[notifications[j]]` is decremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `[last_unread, x)` if `i` is not 1 or 2, `last_unread` is 0, `x` is updated to the next value read from the input and must be greater than 0, `ans` is `ans - 1`, `q` is greater than 0, `q0` is 2, `i` is updated to the next value read from the input, `x` is greater than or equal to `last_unread` if `i` is not 2, `unread[notifications[j]]` is decremented by 1.**
