The function `func` does not explicitly define any parameters in its signature. However, based on the problem description, it implicitly processes a series of events defined by tuples `(typei, xi or ti)` where `typei` indicates the type of event, and `xi` or `ti` are specific to the event type. The function handles these events according to their types and constraints, and manages notifications based on these events.

Since the function's return value is not specified in the provided information, we assume it either returns a result based on the processed events or modifies some internal state that reflects the outcome of processing these events.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a series of events represented as tuples `(typei, xi or ti)`, where `typei` is an integer indicating the type of the event, and `xi` or `ti` are integers related to the event. The function handles these events and manages notifications accordingly.
