The value of `last_unread` is updated to `x`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000, `notifications` is a list that is either empty or contains `[x]`, `unread[notifications[j]]` is decremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `[last_unread, x)`, `ans` is `ans - (x - last_unread)`, `q` is greater than 0, `q0` is 1, `i` and `x` are specific integers read from the input, `i` is 1 or not 1, `x` is greater than or equal to `last_unread` if `i` is not 2, `last_unread` is `x`**
