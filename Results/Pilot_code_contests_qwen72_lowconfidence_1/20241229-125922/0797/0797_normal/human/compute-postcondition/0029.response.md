The code snippet `print(ans)` outputs the current value of `ans` to the console. This operation does not change the state of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that the value of `ans` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000, `n` and `q` have been assigned specific values from the input, `notifications` is a list that is either empty or contains `[x]`, `unread` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` except `unread[x]` is 1 if `i` is 1, or `unread[x]` is 0 if `i` is 2, or `unread[notifications[j]]` is decremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `[last_unread, x)` if `i` is not 1 or 2, `last_unread` is 0 if `i` is 2, or `x` if `i` is not 2, `ans` is 1 if `i` is 1, or 0 if `i` is 2, or `ans - (x - last_unread)` if `i` is not 1 or 2, `q` is greater than 0, `q0` is 0, `i` and `x` are specific integers read from the input, `i` is 1 or not 1, and `x` is greater than or equal to `last_unread` if `i` is not 2. The value of `ans` has been printed.**
