The code reads two integers from standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `q`. These values are read from the input and are now specific values within the given range (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000).

Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000, and `n` and `q` have been assigned specific values from the input. Each event is represented as a tuple (typei, xi or ti), where typei is an integer (1 ≤ typei ≤ 3) indicating the type of the event, and xi or ti are integers (1 ≤ xi ≤ n, 1 ≤ ti ≤ q) depending on the event type. Initially, there are no notifications.**
