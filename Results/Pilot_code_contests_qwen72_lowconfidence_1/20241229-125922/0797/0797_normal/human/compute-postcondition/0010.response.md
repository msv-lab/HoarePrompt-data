`notifications` is an empty list, and `x` is a specific integer read from the input. After executing the code, `x` is appended to `notifications`. Therefore, the new state of `notifications` is a list containing the single element `x`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000, `n` and `q` have been assigned specific values from the input, `notifications` is a list containing `[x]`, `unread` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` except `unread[x]` which is now 1, `last_unread` is 0, `ans` is 1, `q` must be greater than 0, `q0` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is a specific integer read from the input.**
