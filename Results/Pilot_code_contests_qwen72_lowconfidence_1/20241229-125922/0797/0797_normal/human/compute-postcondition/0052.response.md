The code snippet reads two integers `i` and `x` from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `i` and `x`. This impacts the values of these two variables specifically.

- `i` and `x` are updated to the values read from the input.
- All other variables (`n`, `q`, `notifications`, `unread`, `last_unread`, `ans`, `q0`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions that `n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000, and `q` is greater than 0, and `q0` is 2, and the structure of `unread` and `notifications` lists, and the value of `last_unread` remain valid.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300,000, `n` and `q` have been assigned specific values from the input, `notifications` is a list that is either empty or contains `[x]` (if `i` is 1, `notifications` contains `[x]` or `[... x]` if initially contained `[x]`), `unread` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` except `unread[x]` is 1 if `i` is 1, or `unread[x]` is 0 if `i` is 2, or `unread[notifications[j]]` is decremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `[last_unread, x)` if `i` is not 1 or 2, `last_unread` is 0 if `i` is 2, or `x` if `i` is not 2, `ans` is printed, `q` is greater than 0, `q0` is 2, `i` and `x` are specific integers read from the input, `i` is 1 or not 1, and `x` is greater than or equal to `last_unread` if `i` is not 2, `i` and `x` are updated to the values read from the input.**
