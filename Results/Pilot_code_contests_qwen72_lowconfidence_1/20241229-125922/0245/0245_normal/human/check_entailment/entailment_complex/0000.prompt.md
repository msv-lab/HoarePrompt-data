You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Luba has a ticket consisting of 6 digits. In one move she can choose digit in any position and replace it with arbitrary digit. She wants to know the minimum number of digits she needs to replace in order to make the ticket lucky.

The ticket is considered lucky if the sum of first three digits equals to the sum of last three digits.

Input

You are given a string consisting of 6 characters (all characters are digits from 0 to 9) — this string denotes Luba's ticket. The ticket can start with the digit 0.

Output

Print one number — the minimum possible number of digits Luba needs to replace to make the ticket lucky.

Examples

Input

000000


Output

0


Input

123456


Output

2


Input

111000


Output

1

Note

In the first example the ticket is already lucky, so the answer is 0.

In the second example Luba can replace 4 and 5 with zeroes, and the ticket will become lucky. It's easy to see that at least two replacements are required.

In the third example Luba can replace any zero with 3. It's easy to see that at least one replacement is required.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a string s of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
def func():
    s, ans = stdin.readline().strip(), float('inf')
    for i in range(0, 10 ** 6):
        cur, tem = i, 0
        
        for j in range(5, -1, -1):
            tem += cur % 10 != int(s[j])
            cur //= 10
        
        if sum([int(x) for x in str(i)[:3]]) == sum([int(y) for y in str(i)[3:]]):
            ans = min(ans, tem)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'. `ans` is the minimum value of `tem` encountered during the loop execution, where `tem` is the count of positions from 0 to 5 where the digit in `s` is different from the corresponding digit in the current value of `i` (considering `i` as a 6-digit number with leading zeros if necessary). This minimum value is only updated when the sum of the first three digits of `i` is equal to the sum of the last three digits of `i`. If no such `i` is found, `ans` remains `float('inf')`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function implicitly accepts a string `s` of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'. It searches for the smallest non-negative integer `i` (treated as a 6-digit number with leading zeros if necessary) such that the sum of the first three digits of `i` equals the sum of the last three digits of `i`, and the number of positions from 0 to 5 where the digit in `s` differs from the corresponding digit in `i` is minimized. The function prints this minimum number of differing positions. If no such `i` is found, it prints `float('inf')`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
