You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Luba has a ticket consisting of 6 digits. In one move she can choose digit in any position and replace it with arbitrary digit. She wants to know the minimum number of digits she needs to replace in order to make the ticket lucky.

The ticket is considered lucky if the sum of first three digits equals to the sum of last three digits.

Input

You are given a string consisting of 6 characters (all characters are digits from 0 to 9) — this string denotes Luba's ticket. The ticket can start with the digit 0.

Output

Print one number — the minimum possible number of digits Luba needs to replace to make the ticket lucky.

Examples

Input

000000


Output

0


Input

123456


Output

2


Input

111000


Output

1

Note

In the first example the ticket is already lucky, so the answer is 0.

In the second example Luba can replace 4 and 5 with zeroes, and the ticket will become lucky. It's easy to see that at least two replacements are required.

In the third example Luba can replace any zero with 3. It's easy to see that at least one replacement is required.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    (s, ans) = (stdin.readline().strip(), float('inf'))
    for i in range(0, 10 ** 6):
        (cur, tem) = (i, 0)
        for j in range(5, -1, -1):
            tem += cur % 10 != int(s[j])
            cur //= 10
        if sum([int(x) for x in str(i)[:3]]) == sum([int(y) for y in str(i)[3:]]):
            ans = min(ans, tem)
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program iterates over all possible 6-digit numbers (from 0 to 999999) and checks if the sum of the first three digits equals the sum of the last three digits. However, this approach is highly inefficient and may not terminate within a reasonable time for large inputs, especially since the input is guaranteed to be a 6-digit number.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the input string `s` contains leading zeros correctly. For example, if the input is "000000", the program will still iterate over all 6-digit numbers, which is unnecessary and inefficient.

A more efficient approach would involve calculating the sums of the first and last three digits directly and determining the minimum number of changes required to balance these sums. This can be done in constant time without iterating over all possible 6-digit numbers.

For example, consider the input "000000":
- The program will correctly output 0 because the ticket is already lucky.
- However, for the input "123456", the program will also eventually output 2, but it will take an unnecessarily long time to do so.

Thus, the program is incorrect due to its inefficiency and potential handling issues with leading zeros.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function implicitly accepts a string `s` of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'. It searches for the smallest non-negative integer `i` (treated as a 6-digit number with leading zeros if necessary) such that the sum of the first three digits of `i` equals the sum of the last three digits of `i`, and the number of positions from 0 to 5 where the digit in `s` differs from the corresponding digit in `i` is minimized. The function prints this minimum number of differing positions. If no such `i` is found, it prints `float('inf')`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
