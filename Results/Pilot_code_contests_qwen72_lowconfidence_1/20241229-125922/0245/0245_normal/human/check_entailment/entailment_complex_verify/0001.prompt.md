You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Luba has a ticket consisting of 6 digits. In one move she can choose digit in any position and replace it with arbitrary digit. She wants to know the minimum number of digits she needs to replace in order to make the ticket lucky.

The ticket is considered lucky if the sum of first three digits equals to the sum of last three digits.

Input

You are given a string consisting of 6 characters (all characters are digits from 0 to 9) — this string denotes Luba's ticket. The ticket can start with the digit 0.

Output

Print one number — the minimum possible number of digits Luba needs to replace to make the ticket lucky.

Examples

Input

000000


Output

0


Input

123456


Output

2


Input

111000


Output

1

Note

In the first example the ticket is already lucky, so the answer is 0.

In the second example Luba can replace 4 and 5 with zeroes, and the ticket will become lucky. It's easy to see that at least two replacements are required.

In the third example Luba can replace any zero with 3. It's easy to see that at least one replacement is required.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    (s, ans) = (stdin.readline().strip(), float('inf'))
    for i in range(0, 10 ** 6):
        (cur, tem) = (i, 0)
        for j in range(5, -1, -1):
            tem += cur % 10 != int(s[j])
            cur //= 10
        if sum([int(x) for x in str(i)[:3]]) == sum([int(y) for y in str(i)[3:]]):
            ans = min(ans, tem)
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through all possible 6-digit numbers (from 0 to 999999) and checking if the sum of the first three digits equals the sum of the last three digits. For each number, it counts the number of digits that differ from the original ticket and keeps track of the minimum number of changes needed.

However, this approach is inefficient and may not work correctly for all cases due to the following issues:

1. **Efficiency**: The program iterates through \(10^6\) (one million) possible numbers, which is computationally expensive and unnecessary for this problem. A more efficient approach would involve directly manipulating the digits of the original ticket to minimize the number of changes.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Changes**: The program does not correctly handle the minimum number of changes required. For example, consider the input `123987`. The program should output 1 because changing the '9' to '0' makes the ticket lucky (`123087`), but the program might not correctly identify this optimal solution due to its brute-force approach.

A more efficient and correct approach would involve calculating the difference between the sums of the first three and last three digits and determining the minimum number of changes needed to balance these sums. This can be done in linear time relative to the length of the ticket.

Here is a more efficient and correct solution for reference:

```python
def min_replacements_to_lucky_ticket(ticket):
    # Convert the ticket to a list of integers
    digits = [int(d) for d in ticket]
    
    # Calculate the sums of the first three and last three digits
    sum_first_three = sum(digits[:3])
    sum_last_three = sum(digits[3:])
    
    # Calculate the absolute difference between the sums
    diff = abs(sum_first_three - sum_last_three)
    
    # Initialize the minimum number of replacements
    min_replacements = float('inf')
    
    # Try replacing each digit to minimize the difference
    for i in range(6):
        for new_digit in range(10):
            new_digits = digits[:]
            new_digits[i] = new_digit
            new_sum_first_three = sum(new_digits[:3])
            new_sum_last_three = sum(new_digits[3:])
            new_diff = abs(new_sum_first_three - new_sum_last_three)
            if new_diff < diff:
                min_replacements = min(min_replacements, 1)
                break
    
    # If no single replacement can make the ticket lucky, try combinations
    if min_replacements == float('inf'):
        for i in range(6):
            for j in range(i + 1, 6):
                for new_digit1 in range(10):
                    for new_digit2 in range(10):
                        new_digits = digits[:]
                        new_digits[i] = new_digit1
                        new_digits[j] = new_digit2
                        new_sum_first_three = sum(new_digits[:3])
                        new_sum_last_three = sum(new_digits[3:])
                        new_diff = abs(new_sum_first_three - new_sum_last_three)
                        if new_diff == 0:
                            min_replacements = min(min_replacements, 2)
                            break
                if min_replacements == 2:
                    break
            if min_replacements == 2:
                break
    
    # If no replacements are needed, the ticket is already lucky
    if diff == 0:
        min_replacements = 0
    
    return min_replacements

# Example usage
print(min_replacements_to_lucky_ticket("000000"))  # Output: 0
print(min_replacements_to_lucky_ticket("123456"))  # Output: 2
print(min_replacements_to_lucky_ticket("111000"))  # Output: 1
```

This solution is more efficient and correctly handles all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from sys import stdin

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a string s of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
def func():
    s, ans = stdin.readline().strip(), float('inf')
    for i in range(0, 10 ** 6):
        cur, tem = i, 0
        
        for j in range(5, -1, -1):
            tem += cur % 10 != int(s[j])
            cur //= 10
        
        if sum([int(x) for x in str(i)[:3]]) == sum([int(y) for y in str(i)[3:]]):
            ans = min(ans, tem)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'. `ans` is the minimum value of `tem` encountered during the loop execution, where `tem` is the count of positions from 0 to 5 where the digit in `s` is different from the corresponding digit in the current value of `i` (considering `i` as a 6-digit number with leading zeros if necessary). This minimum value is only updated when the sum of the first three digits of `i` is equal to the sum of the last three digits of `i`. If no such `i` is found, `ans` remains `float('inf')`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function implicitly accepts a string `s` of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'. It searches for the smallest non-negative integer `i` (treated as a 6-digit number with leading zeros if necessary) such that the sum of the first three digits of `i` equals the sum of the last three digits of `i`, and the number of positions from 0 to 5 where the digit in `s` differs from the corresponding digit in `i` is minimized. The function prints this minimum number of differing positions. If no such `i` is found, it prints `float('inf')`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
