To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
- `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`.
- `i` is 1.
- `cur` is 0.
- `j` is 4.
- `tem` is determined based on the values of `s[5]` and `s[4]`:
  - `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is '0'.
  - `tem` is 2 if `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is not '0'.
  - `tem` is 0 if `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is '0'.
  - `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is not '0'.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(5, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `j` from 5 down to 0.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 4.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1, making it 3.

### Adjusted States:
- `j` is decremented by 1, so `j` becomes 3.
- The other variables (`s`, `ans`, `i`, `cur`, `tem`) remain unchanged because they are not modified by the loop control itself.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 1, `cur` is 0, `j` is 3, `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is '0', `tem` is 2 if `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is not '0', `tem` is 0 if `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is '0', `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is not '0'**
