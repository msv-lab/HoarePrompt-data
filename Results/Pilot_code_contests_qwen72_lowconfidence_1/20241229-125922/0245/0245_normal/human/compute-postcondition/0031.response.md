To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
- `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`.
- `i` is 1.
- `cur` is 0.
- `j` is -1.
- `tem` is the number of positions in `s` where the character is not '0', except for the last position where it checks against '1'.
- If the sum of the digits of the first three characters of `i` (which is 1) is equal to the sum of the digits of the last three characters of `i` (which is 0), then `ans` is `tem`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(0, 10 ** 6):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `10 ** 6` (1,000,000).
2. **Current State of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: Increment `i` from 1 to 2.
- **Other Variables**: Since the loop body is omitted, we don't know how `cur`, `j`, `ans`, and `tem` are modified within the loop. However, based on the given state, these variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

### New State:
- `s` remains a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
- `ans` remains either `float('inf')` or `tem`.
- `i` is now 2.
- `cur` remains 0.
- `j` remains -1.
- `tem` remains the number of positions in `s` where the character is not '0', except for the last position where it checks against '1'.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'. `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`. `i` is 2. `cur` is 0. `j` is -1. `tem` is the number of positions in `s` where the character is not '0', except for the last position where it checks against '1'.**
