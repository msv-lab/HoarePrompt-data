Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'. `ans` is `min(float('inf'), tem)` (which simplifies to `tem` if `ans` was `float('inf')`), `i` is 2, and the sum of the first three digits of `i` (considering `i` as a 6-digit number with leading zeros if necessary) is equal to the sum of the last three digits of `i`. `cur` is 0, and `j` is -1. `tem` is the count of positions where the corresponding digit in `s` is not equal to the corresponding digit in the original value of `cur`. If the sum of the first three digits of `i` is not equal to the sum of the last three digits of `i`, `ans`, `i`, `cur`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
