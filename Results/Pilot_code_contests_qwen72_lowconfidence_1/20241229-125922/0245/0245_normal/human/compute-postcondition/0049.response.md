Functionality: ** The function implicitly accepts a string `s` of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'. It searches for the smallest non-negative integer `i` (treated as a 6-digit number with leading zeros if necessary) such that the sum of the first three digits of `i` equals the sum of the last three digits of `i`, and the number of positions from 0 to 5 where the digit in `s` differs from the corresponding digit in `i` is minimized. The function prints this minimum number of differing positions. If no such `i` is found, it prints `float('inf')`. **

### Explanation:
- **Input**: The function reads a string `s` from standard input, which is expected to be a 6-character string of digits.
- **Processing**:
  - The function iterates over all possible 6-digit numbers (from 0 to 999999).
  - For each number `i`, it checks if the sum of the first three digits equals the sum of the last three digits.
  - It calculates the number of positions (0 to 5) where the digits of `i` differ from the corresponding digits in `s`.
  - It keeps track of the minimum number of differing positions (`ans`) among all valid `i`.
- **Output**: The function prints the minimum number of differing positions. If no valid `i` is found, it prints `float('inf')`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty or Invalid Input**: The function assumes the input `s` is always a 6-character string of digits. If the input is invalid (e.g., not a string, not 6 characters, or contains non-digits), the behavior is undefined.
- **No Valid `i` Found**: If no 6-digit number satisfies the condition (sum of the first three digits equals the sum of the last three digits), the function prints `float('inf')`.
- **Leading Zeros**: The function correctly handles leading zeros by treating `i` as a 6-digit number.
