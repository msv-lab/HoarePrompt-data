The value of `cur` is divided by 10 using integer division, which means the decimal part is discarded. Given that `cur` is initially 2, dividing 2 by 10 results in 0. Therefore, the updated value of `cur` is 0.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 2, `cur` is 0, `j` is -1, `tem` is 0 if `s[-1]` is '2' or 1 if `s[-1]` is not '2'**
