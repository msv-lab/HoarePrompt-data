To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop and the initial state:

### For Loop Analysis:
```python
for j in range(5, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
- The `range(5, -1, -1)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 5 down to 0 (inclusive).
- The loop will execute 6 times, with `j` taking values 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
- `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`.
- `i` is 2.
- `cur` is 2.
- `j` is -1.
- `tem` is 0.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will execute as long as the range function generates valid indices. In this case, `range(5, -1, -1)` will always generate the sequence [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0], so the loop will always execute 6 times.

2. **Initial State Adjustments**:
   - The initial state of `j` is -1. However, the loop will set `j` to 5 on the first iteration, so `j` being -1 does not prevent the loop from executing.
   - The other variables (`s`, `ans`, `i`, `cur`, `tem`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, but they are part of the initial state.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop will always execute regardless of the initial value of `j` (it will be set to 5 on the first iteration), no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop executes. However, for completeness, we should state the initial conditions clearly.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `j` is -1, `tem` is 0**.
