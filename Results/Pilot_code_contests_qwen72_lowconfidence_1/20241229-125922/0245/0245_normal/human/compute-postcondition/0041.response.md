The code snippet `cur //= 10` performs integer division of `cur` by 10 and updates `cur` with the result. Given the initial state, `cur` is 0, and performing integer division of 0 by 10 results in 0. Therefore, `cur` remains 0.

The other variables (`s`, `ans`, `i`, `j`, `tem`) are not affected by this operation, so their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 2, `cur` is 0, `j` is 0, `tem` is incremented by 1 if `s[0]` is not '0', otherwise `tem` remains unchanged.**
