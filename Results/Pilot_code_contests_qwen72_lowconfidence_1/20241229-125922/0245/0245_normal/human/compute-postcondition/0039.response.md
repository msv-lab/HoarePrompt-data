To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
- `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`.
- `i` is 2.
- `cur` is 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `tem` is determined based on the values of `s[0]` and `s[-1]` as follows:
  - `tem` is 1 if `s[0]` is not '0' and `s[-1]` is '2'.
  - `tem` is 2 if `s[0]` is not '0' and `s[-1]` is not '2'.
  - `tem` is 0 if `s[0]` is '0' and `s[-1]` is '2'.
  - `tem` is 1 if `s[0]` is '0' and `s[-1]` is not '2'.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(5, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `j` from 5 down to 0 (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1, but since `j` is already 0, decrementing it would make `j` become -1, which is out of the range [5, -1, -1].

### Conclusion:
- Since `j` is 0 and the loop decrements `j` by 1, the next value of `j` would be -1, which is outside the valid range for the loop.
- Therefore, the loop will not execute one more time.

### Adjusted State:
- The loop has finished executing, so no further adjustments are needed for the loop to execute again.

State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 2, `cur` is 0, `j` is 0, `tem` is determined based on the values of `s[0]` and `s[-1]` as described.**
