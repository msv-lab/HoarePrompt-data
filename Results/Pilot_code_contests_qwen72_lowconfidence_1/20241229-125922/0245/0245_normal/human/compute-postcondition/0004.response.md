The code snippet `tem += cur % 10 != int(s[j])` updates the value of `tem` based on the comparison between `cur % 10` and `int(s[j])`.

- `cur % 10` gives the last digit of `cur`.
- `int(s[j])` converts the character at index `j` of the string `s` to an integer.

If `cur % 10` is not equal to `int(s[j])`, then `cur % 10 != int(s[j])` evaluates to `True` (which is equivalent to `1` in Python), and `tem` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if they are equal, `tem` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
- `ans` is `float('inf')`.
- `i` is 0.
- `cur` is 0.
- `tem` is 0.
- `j` is 5.

Let's evaluate the code:
- `cur % 10` is `0 % 10`, which is `0`.
- `int(s[5])` converts the 6th character of `s` to an integer.

Since `s` is a string of digits, `int(s[5])` is a digit from 0 to 9.

If `int(s[5])` is not equal to `0`, then `tem` will be incremented by 1. If `int(s[5])` is equal to `0`, then `tem` will remain 0.

Therefore, the output state depends on the value of `s[5]`:
- If `s[5]` is '0', then `tem` remains 0.
- If `s[5]` is not '0', then `tem` becomes 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is `float('inf')`, `i` is 0, `cur` is 0, `tem` is 0 if `s[5]` is '0' or `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is not '0', `j` is 5**.
