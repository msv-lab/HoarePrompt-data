To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step:

1. **Loop Statement**: `for j in range(5, -1, -1):`
   - This loop iterates over the values of `j` from 5 down to 0 (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.

2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
   - `ans` is `float('inf')`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `cur` is 0.
   - `tem` is 0 if `s[4]` is '0' or `tem` is 2 if `s[4]` is not '0'.
   - `j` is 4.

3. **Adjustments for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop variable `j` is decremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 3.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - The other variables (`s`, `ans`, `i`, `cur`, and `tem`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body. Since the loop body is omitted, we assume these variables are not changed.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is `float('inf')`, `i` is 0, `cur` is 0, `tem` is 0 if `s[4]` is '0' or `tem` is 2 if `s[4]` is not '0', `j` is 3**
