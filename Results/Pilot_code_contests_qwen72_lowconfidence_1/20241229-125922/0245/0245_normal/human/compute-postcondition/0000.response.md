The code snippet `s, ans = stdin.readline().strip(), float('inf')` updates the variables `s` and `ans`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: `stdin.readline().strip()` reads a line from the standard input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace, including the newline character. Given the initial state, the input is a string `s` of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'. After this operation, `s` will be set to this input string.

2. **Assigning `ans`**: `float('inf')` assigns the value of positive infinity to the variable `ans`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is `float('inf')`**
