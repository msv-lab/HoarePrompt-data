The value of `cur` is updated by performing integer division by 10 (`cur //= 10`). This operation reduces `cur` by one decimal place. Since the initial value of `cur` is 0, performing integer division by 10 on 0 results in 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is `float('inf')`, `i` is 0, `cur` is 0, `tem` is 0 if `s[4]` is '0' or `tem` is 2 if `s[4]` is not '0', `j` is 4.
