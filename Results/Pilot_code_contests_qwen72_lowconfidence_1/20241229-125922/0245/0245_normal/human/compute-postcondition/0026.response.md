The value of `cur` is initially 0. The operation `cur //= 10` performs an integer division of `cur` by 10, which does not change the value of `cur` because 0 divided by any non-zero number is 0. Therefore, the value of `cur` remains 0.

The other variables (`s`, `ans`, `i`, `j`, `tem`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 1, `cur` is 0, `j` is 3, `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is '0' and `s[3]` is '0', `tem` is 2 if `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is '0' and `s[3]` is not '0', `tem` is 2 if `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is not '0' and `s[3]` is '0', `tem` is 3 if `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is not '0' and `s[3]` is not '0', `tem` is 0 if `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is '0' and `s[3]` is '0', `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is '0' and `s[3]` is not '0', `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is not '0' and `s[3]` is '0', `tem` is 2 if `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is not '0' and `s[3]` is not '0'.**
