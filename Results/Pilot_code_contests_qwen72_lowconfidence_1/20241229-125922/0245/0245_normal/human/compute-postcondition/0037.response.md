The value of `tem` is updated based on the condition `cur % 10 != int(s[j])`. Given the initial state:

- `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
- `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`.
- `i` is 2.
- `cur` is 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `tem` is 0 if `s[-1]` is '2' or 1 if `s[-1]` is not '2'.

Since `cur` is 0, `cur % 10` is also 0. The value of `s[j]` (which is `s[0]`) is a digit from '0' to '9'. Let's consider the two cases:

1. If `s[0]` is '0':
   - `cur % 10 != int(s[j])` evaluates to `0 != 0`, which is `False`.
   - `tem` remains unchanged.

2. If `s[0]` is not '0' (i.e., '1' to '9'):
   - `cur % 10 != int(s[j])` evaluates to `0 != int(s[0])`, which is `True`.
   - `tem` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the output state depends on whether `s[0]` is '0' or not:

- If `s[0]` is '0':
  - `tem` remains 0 if `s[-1]` is '2' or 1 if `s[-1]` is not '2'.

- If `s[0]` is not '0':
  - `tem` becomes 1 if `s[-1]` is '2' or 2 if `s[-1]` is not '2'.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 2, `cur` is 0, `j` is 0, `tem` is 1 if `s[0]` is not '0' and `s[-1]` is '2', `tem` is 2 if `s[0]` is not '0' and `s[-1]` is not '2', `tem` is 0 if `s[0]` is '0' and `s[-1]` is '2', `tem` is 1 if `s[0]` is '0' and `s[-1]` is not '2'.**
