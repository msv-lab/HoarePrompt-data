The code snippet modifies the value of `tem` based on the comparison between `cur % 10` and `int(s[j])`. Let's break down the impact:

- `s` remains a string of length 6 with each character being a digit from '0' to '9'.
- `ans` remains `float('inf')`.
- `i` remains 0.
- `cur` remains 0.
- `j` remains 3.
- `tem` is updated based on the condition `cur % 10 != int(s[j])`.

Given:
- `cur % 10` is `0 % 10` which is 0.
- `s[j]` is `s[3]`, which is a digit from '0' to '9'.

The condition `cur % 10 != int(s[j])` simplifies to `0 != int(s[3])`.

If `s[3]` is '0':
- `0 != 0` is False, so `tem` remains 0 if `s[4]` is '0' or 2 if `s[4]` is not '0'.

If `s[3]` is not '0':
- `0 != int(s[3])` is True, so `tem` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the final value of `tem` depends on whether `s[3]` is '0' or not:
- If `s[3]` is '0', `tem` remains 0 if `s[4]` is '0' or 2 if `s[4]` is not '0'.
- If `s[3]` is not '0', `tem` becomes 1 if `s[4]` is '0' or 3 if `s[4]` is not '0'.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is `float('inf')`, `i` is 0, `cur` is 0, `tem` is 1 if `s[3]` is not '0' and `s[4]` is '0', `tem` is 3 if `s[3]` is not '0' and `s[4]` is not '0', `tem` is 0 if `s[3]` is '0' and `s[4]` is '0', `tem` is 2 if `s[3]` is '0' and `s[4]` is not '0', `j` is 3**.
