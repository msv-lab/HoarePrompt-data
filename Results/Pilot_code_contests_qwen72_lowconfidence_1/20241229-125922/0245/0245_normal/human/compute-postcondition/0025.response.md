The code snippet `tem += cur % 10 != int(s[j])` modifies the value of `tem` based on the condition `cur % 10 != int(s[j])`.

- `cur` is 0, so `cur % 10` is 0.
- `s` is a string of length 6, and `j` is 3, so `int(s[j])` is the integer value of the 4th character in the string `s`.
- The condition `cur % 10 != int(s[j])` simplifies to `0 != int(s[j])`.

Let's evaluate the possible outcomes for `tem` based on the initial conditions:

1. If `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is '0', `tem` is 1.
2. If `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is not '0', `tem` is 2.
3. If `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is '0', `tem` is 0.
4. If `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is not '0', `tem` is 1.

Now, let's consider the impact of the condition `0 != int(s[3])` on `tem`:

- If `int(s[3])` is 0, `0 != int(s[3])` is `False`, and `tem` remains unchanged.
- If `int(s[3])` is not 0, `0 != int(s[3])` is `True`, and `tem` is incremented by 1.

Thus, the final value of `tem` depends on whether `s[3]` is '0' or not:

- If `s[3]` is '0':
  - `tem` remains the same as its initial value.
- If `s[3]` is not '0':
  - `tem` is incremented by 1.

Given the initial conditions for `tem`:
- If `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is '0', `tem` is 1.
- If `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is not '0', `tem` is 2.
- If `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is '0', `tem` is 0.
- If `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is not '0', `tem` is 1.

The updated values of `tem` are:
- If `s[3]` is '0':
  - `tem` remains 1, 2, 0, or 1 respectively.
- If `s[3]` is not '0':
  - `tem` becomes 2, 3, 1, or 2 respectively.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 1, `cur` is 0, `j` is 3, `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is '0' and `s[3]` is '0', `tem` is 2 if `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is '0' and `s[3]` is not '0', `tem` is 2 if `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is not '0' and `s[3]` is '0', `tem` is 3 if `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is not '0' and `s[3]` is not '0', `tem` is 0 if `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is '0' and `s[3]` is '0', `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is '0' and `s[3]` is not '0', `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is not '0' and `s[3]` is '0', `tem` is 2 if `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is not '0' and `s[3]` is not '0'.**
