The code snippet `cur, tem = i, 0` updates the values of `cur` and `tem`. Let's evaluate the changes:

- `cur` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 1.
- `tem` is set to 0.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 1, `cur` is 1, `tem` is 0, `j` is -1.**
