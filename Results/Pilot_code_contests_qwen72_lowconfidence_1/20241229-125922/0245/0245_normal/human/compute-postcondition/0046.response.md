Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'. `ans` is the minimum value of `tem` encountered during the loop execution, where `tem` is the count of positions from 0 to 5 where the digit in `s` is different from the corresponding digit in the current value of `i` (considering `i` as a 6-digit number with leading zeros if necessary). This minimum value is only updated when the sum of the first three digits of `i` is equal to the sum of the last three digits of `i`. If no such `i` is found, `ans` remains `float('inf')`.**
