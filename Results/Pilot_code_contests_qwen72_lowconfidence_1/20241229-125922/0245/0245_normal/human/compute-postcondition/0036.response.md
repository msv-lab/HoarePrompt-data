According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. The loop iterates from 5 down to 0 (inclusive) with a step of -1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is -1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to 0.

The other variables (`s`, `ans`, `i`, `cur`, `tem`) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition, but their values remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 2, `cur` is 0, `j` is 0, `tem` is 0 if `s[-1]` is '2' or 1 if `s[-1]` is not '2'**
