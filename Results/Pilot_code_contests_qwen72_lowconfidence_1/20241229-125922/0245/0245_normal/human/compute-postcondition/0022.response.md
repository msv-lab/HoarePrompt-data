The code snippet `tem += cur % 10 != int(s[j])` modifies the value of `tem` based on the comparison between `cur % 10` and `int(s[j])`.

- Initial State: `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 1, `cur` is 0, `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is not '1' else `tem` is 0, `j` is 4.

- Impact of the code:
  - `cur % 10` evaluates to `0 % 10`, which is `0`.
  - `int(s[j])` evaluates to `int(s[4])`, which is the integer value of the 5th character in the string `s`.
  - The expression `cur % 10 != int(s[4])` evaluates to `0 != int(s[4])`, which is `True` if `s[4]` is not '0', and `False` if `s[4]` is '0'.
  - `tem` is incremented by 1 if `0 != int(s[4])` is `True`, otherwise, `tem` remains unchanged.

- Calculation:
  - If `s[4]` is not '0', then `0 != int(s[4])` is `True`, and `tem` is incremented by 1.
  - If `s[4]` is '0', then `0 != int(s[4])` is `False`, and `tem` remains the same.

- Output State:
  - If `s[4]` is not '0', `tem` becomes `tem + 1`.
  - If `s[4]` is '0', `tem` remains `1` if `s[5]` is not '1', otherwise, `tem` remains `0`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 1, `cur` is 0, `j` is 4, `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is '0', `tem` is 2 if `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is not '0', `tem` is 0 if `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is '0', `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is not '0'.**
