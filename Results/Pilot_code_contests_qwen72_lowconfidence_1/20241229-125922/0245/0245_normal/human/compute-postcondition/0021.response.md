To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
- `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`.
- `i` is 1.
- `cur` is 0.
- `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is not '1', else `tem` is 0.
- `j` is 5.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(5, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `j = 5` down to `j = 0` (inclusive). The loop will continue as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 5.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 4.

### Adjusted State:
- `s` remains a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
- `ans` remains either `float('inf')` or `tem`.
- `i` remains 1.
- `cur` remains 0.
- `tem` remains 1 if `s[5]` is not '1', else `tem` is 0.
- `j` is now 4.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 1, `cur` is 0, `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is not '1' else `tem` is 0, `j` is 4**
