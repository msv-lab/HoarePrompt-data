The given code snippet updates the value of `tem` based on the condition `cur % 10 != int(s[j])`. Let's evaluate this step by step:

- `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
- `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`.
- `i` is 2.
- `cur` is 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `tem` is determined based on the values of `s[0]` and `s[-1]`.

The operation `cur % 10` results in `0` because `cur` is 0. The condition `cur % 10 != int(s[j])` checks if `0` is not equal to the integer value of the first character in the string `s`.

If `s[0]` is '0', then `int(s[j])` is 0, and the condition `0 != 0` is `False`, so `tem` remains unchanged.

If `s[0]` is not '0' (any digit from '1' to '9'), then `int(s[j])` is a non-zero integer, and the condition `0 != int(s[j])` is `True`, so `tem` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the output state depends on the value of `s[0]`:
- If `s[0]` is '0', `tem` remains unchanged.
- If `s[0]` is not '0', `tem` is incremented by 1.

Since `s[0]` can be any digit from '0' to '9', we need to consider both cases:

1. If `s[0]` is '0':
   - `tem` remains the same.
   - Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 2, `cur` is 0, `j` is 0, `tem` is determined based on the values of `s[0]` and `s[-1]` as described.**

2. If `s[0]` is not '0':
   - `tem` is incremented by 1.
   - Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 2, `cur` is 0, `j` is 0, `tem` is incremented by 1.**

To summarize, the final output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 2, `cur` is 0, `j` is 0, `tem` is incremented by 1 if `s[0]` is not '0', otherwise `tem` remains unchanged.**
