To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop and the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
- `ans` is `float('inf')`.
- `i` is 0.
- `cur` is 0.
- `tem` is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(5, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The for loop iterates over the range from 5 down to 0 (inclusive) in steps of -1. This means the loop will execute 6 times, starting with `j = 5` and ending with `j = 0`.

### Required Adjustments:
- The loop will execute as long as the range is valid, which it is in this case because the range `range(5, -1, -1)` is well-defined and will produce 6 iterations.
- The initial state of `s`, `ans`, `i`, `cur`, and `tem` does not affect the loop's ability to execute, as the loop only depends on the range of `j`.

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute regardless of the initial values of `s`, `ans`, `i`, `cur`, and `tem` because the range `range(5, -1, -1)` is always valid and will produce 6 iterations.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is `float('inf')`, `i` is 0, `cur` is 0, `tem` is 0, `j` is 5**
