`cur` is divided by 10 using floor division, which means it is reduced to the largest integer less than or equal to the result of the division. Since `cur` is initially 1, dividing it by 10 results in 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 1, `cur` is 0, `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is not '1' else `tem` is 0, `j` is 5**
