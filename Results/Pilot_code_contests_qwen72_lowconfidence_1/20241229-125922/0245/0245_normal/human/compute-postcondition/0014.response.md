The code snippet `ans = min(ans, tem)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum between its current value (`float('inf')`) and the value of `tem`. Since `tem` is defined as the count of positions from 0 to 5 where the digit in `s` is not '0', and `s` is a string of length 6 with digits from '0' to '9', `tem` will be a non-negative integer. The value of `ans` was initially `float('inf')`, which is greater than any possible value of `tem`. Therefore, `ans` will be updated to the value of `tem`.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is `tem`, `i` is 0, `cur` is 0, `tem` is the count of positions from 0 to 5 where the digit in `s` is not '0', `j` is -1, and the sum of the first three digits of `i` is equal to the sum of the last three digits of `i`.**
