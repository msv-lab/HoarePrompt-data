The code snippet `tem += cur % 10 != int(s[j])` updates the value of `tem` based on the comparison between `cur % 10` and `int(s[j])`.

- `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
- `ans` is `float('inf')`.
- `i` is 0.
- `cur` is 0.
- `tem` is 0 if `s[4]` is '0' or `tem` is 1 if `s[4]` is not '0'.
- `j` is 4.

Let's evaluate the expression `cur % 10 != int(s[j])`:

- `cur % 10` is `0 % 10`, which is `0`.
- `int(s[j])` is `int(s[4])`.

If `s[4]` is '0':
- `int(s[4])` is `0`.
- `cur % 10 != int(s[4])` evaluates to `0 != 0`, which is `False`.
- `tem` remains `0`.

If `s[4]` is not '0':
- `int(s[4])` is a non-zero digit (1 through 9).
- `cur % 10 != int(s[4])` evaluates to `0 != int(s[4])`, which is `True`.
- `tem` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the updated value of `tem` is:
- `tem` remains `0` if `s[4]` is '0'.
- `tem` becomes `2` if `s[4]` is not '0'.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is `float('inf')`, `i` is 0, `cur` is 0, `tem` is 0 if `s[4]` is '0' or `tem` is 2 if `s[4]` is not '0', `j` is 4**.
