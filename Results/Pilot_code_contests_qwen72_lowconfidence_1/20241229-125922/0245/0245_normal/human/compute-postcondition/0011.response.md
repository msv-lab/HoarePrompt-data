The value of `cur` is updated to be the floor division of its current value by 10. Since the initial value of `cur` is 0, `cur // 10` results in 0. Therefore, the value of `cur` remains 0.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is `float('inf')`, `i` is 0, `cur` is 0, `tem` is 1 if `s[3]` is not '0' and `s[4]` is '0', `tem` is 3 if `s[3]` is not '0' and `s[4]` is not '0', `tem` is 0 if `s[3]` is '0' and `s[4]` is '0', `tem` is 2 if `s[3]` is '0' and `s[4]` is not '0', `j` is 3**
