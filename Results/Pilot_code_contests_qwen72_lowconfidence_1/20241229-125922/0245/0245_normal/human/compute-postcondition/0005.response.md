The code `cur //= 10` performs integer division of `cur` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `cur` if it were a number.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
- `ans` is `float('inf')`.
- `i` is 0.
- `cur` is 0.
- `tem` is 0 if `s[5]` is '0' or `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is not '0'.
- `j` is 5.

Since `cur` is initially 0, performing `cur //= 10` does not change its value, as 0 divided by 10 is still 0.

Therefore, the output state remains:
- `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
- `ans` is `float('inf')`.
- `i` is 0.
- `cur` is 0.
- `tem` is 0 if `s[5]` is '0' or `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is not '0'.
- `j` is 5.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is `float('inf')`, `i` is 0, `cur` is 0, `tem` is 0 if `s[5]` is '0' or `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is not '0', `j` is 5**.
