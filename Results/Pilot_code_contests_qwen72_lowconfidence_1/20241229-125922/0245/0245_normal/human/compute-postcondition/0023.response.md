The code snippet `cur //= 10` modifies the value of `cur` by performing integer division by 10.

- Initial State:
  - `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
  - `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`.
  - `i` is 1.
  - `cur` is 0.
  - `j` is 4.
  - `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is '0', `tem` is 2 if `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is not '0', `tem` is 0 if `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is '0', `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is not '0'.

- Impact of the code:
  - `cur //= 10` performs integer division of `cur` by 10.
  - Since `cur` is initially 0, `0 // 10` results in 0.

- Calculation:
  - `cur` remains 0 after the operation.

- Output State:
  - `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
  - `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`.
  - `i` is 1.
  - `cur` is 0.
  - `j` is 4.
  - `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is '0', `tem` is 2 if `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is not '0', `tem` is 0 if `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is '0', `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is not '0'.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 1, `cur` is 0, `j` is 4, `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is '0', `tem` is 2 if `s[5]` is not '1' and `s[4]` is not '0', `tem` is 0 if `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is '0', `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is '1' and `s[4]` is not '0'.**
