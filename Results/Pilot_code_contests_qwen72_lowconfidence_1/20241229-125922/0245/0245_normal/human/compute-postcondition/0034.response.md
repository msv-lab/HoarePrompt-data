The code `tem += cur % 10 != int(s[j])` modifies the value of `tem` based on the condition `cur % 10 != int(s[j])`. Let's evaluate this step by step:

- `cur` is 2.
- `cur % 10` is 2 % 10, which equals 2.
- `j` is -1, so `s[j]` refers to the last character of the string `s`.
- Since `s` is a string of length 6 with each character being a digit from '0' to '9', let's denote the last character of `s` as `s[-1]`.

The expression `cur % 10 != int(s[j])` evaluates to `2 != int(s[-1])`.

- If `s[-1]` is '2', then `2 != int(s[-1])` is `False`, and `tem` remains 0.
- If `s[-1]` is not '2', then `2 != int(s[-1])` is `True`, and `tem` becomes 1.

Since `s` is a string of digits and the exact value of `s[-1]` is not specified, we consider both cases:

1. If `s[-1]` is '2':
   - `tem` remains 0.
   - Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `j` is -1, `tem` is 0**

2. If `s[-1]` is not '2':
   - `tem` becomes 1.
   - Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `j` is -1, `tem` is 1**

Since the exact value of `s[-1]` is not given, we need to cover both possibilities in the output state.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 2, `cur` is 2, `j` is -1, `tem` is 0 if `s[-1]` is '2' or 1 if `s[-1]` is not '2'**
