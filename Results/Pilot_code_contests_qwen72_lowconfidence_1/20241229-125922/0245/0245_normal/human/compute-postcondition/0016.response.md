To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
- `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`.
- `i` is 0.
- `cur` is 0.
- `tem` is the count of positions from 0 to 5 where the digit in `s` is not '0'.
- `j` is -1.
- If the sum of the first three digits of `i` is equal to the sum of the last three digits of `i`, then `ans` is set to `tem`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `float('inf')`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(0, 10 ** 6):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `10 ** 6`.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `cur` is 0.
   - `tem` is the count of positions from 0 to 5 where the digit in `s` is not '0'.
   - `j` is -1.
   - `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:
- **`i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
- **`cur`**: The value of `cur` is not modified in the given information, so it remains 0.
- **`tem`**: The value of `tem` is not modified in the given information, so it remains the same.
- **`j`**: The value of `j` is not modified in the given information, so it remains -1.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` is determined based on the condition inside the loop. However, since we are only adjusting the state for the next iteration, `ans` remains the same unless the condition inside the loop changes it.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which is incremented by 1.

State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 1, `cur` is 0, `tem` is the count of positions from 0 to 5 where the digit in `s` is not '0', and `j` is -1.**
