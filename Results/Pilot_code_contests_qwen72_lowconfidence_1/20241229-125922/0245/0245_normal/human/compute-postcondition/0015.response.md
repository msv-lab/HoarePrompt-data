Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 0, `cur` is 0, `tem` is the count of positions from 0 to 5 where the digit in `s` is not '0', and `j` is -1. If the sum of the first three digits of `i` is equal to the sum of the last three digits of `i`, then `ans` is set to `tem`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `float('inf')`.***
