Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'. `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`. `i` is 2, and the sum of the first three digits of `i` (considering `i` as a 6-digit number with leading zeros if necessary) is equal to the sum of the last three digits of `i`. `cur` is 0, and `j` is -1. `tem` is the count of positions where the corresponding digit in `s` is not equal to the corresponding digit in the original value of `cur` (considering `cur` as a 6-digit number with leading zeros if necessary).***
