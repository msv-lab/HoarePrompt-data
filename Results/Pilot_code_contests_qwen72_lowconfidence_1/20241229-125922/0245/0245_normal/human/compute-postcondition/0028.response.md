Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'. `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`. `i` is 1, and the sum of the digits of the first three characters of `i` (which is 1) is equal to the sum of the digits of the last three characters of `i` (which is 0). `cur` is 0, `j` is -1, `tem` is the number of positions in `s` where the character is not '0', except for the last position where it checks against '1'.***
