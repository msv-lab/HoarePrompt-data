The code snippet `tem += cur % 10 != int(s[j])` updates the value of `tem` based on the condition `cur % 10 != int(s[j])`. Let's evaluate this step by step:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
   - `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `cur` is 1.
   - `tem` is 0.
   - `j` is 5.

2. **Evaluate the Condition**:
   - `cur % 10` evaluates to `1 % 10`, which is `1`.
   - `int(s[j])` converts the character at index 5 of the string `s` to an integer. Since `s` is a string of digits, `s[5]` is a digit from '0' to '9', and `int(s[5])` is an integer from 0 to 9.

3. **Check the Condition**:
   - The condition `1 != int(s[5])` will be `True` if `s[5]` is not '1', and `False` if `s[5]` is '1'.

4. **Update `tem`**:
   - If `1 != int(s[5])` is `True`, then `tem` is incremented by 1.
   - If `1 != int(s[5])` is `False`, then `tem` remains unchanged.

5. **Final Values**:
   - If `s[5]` is not '1', then `tem` becomes `1`.
   - If `s[5]` is '1', then `tem` remains `0`.

Therefore, the output state depends on the value of `s[5]`:
- If `s[5]` is not '1':
  - `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
  - `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`.
  - `i` is 1.
  - `cur` is 1.
  - `tem` is 1.
  - `j` is 5.

- If `s[5]` is '1':
  - `s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9'.
  - `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`.
  - `i` is 1.
  - `cur` is 1.
  - `tem` is 0.
  - `j` is 5.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length 6, where each character is a digit from '0' to '9', `ans` is either `float('inf')` or `tem`, `i` is 1, `cur` is 1, `tem` is 1 if `s[5]` is not '1' else `tem` is 0, `j` is 5**.
