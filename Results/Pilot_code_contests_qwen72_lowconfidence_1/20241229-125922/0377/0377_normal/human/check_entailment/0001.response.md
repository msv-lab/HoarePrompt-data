Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This will cause the program to fail in Python 3 environments. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the input values are very close to each other, which could lead to precision issues due to floating-point arithmetic. However, the primary issue is the use of `raw_input()`, which makes the program incorrect for Python 3 environments.
