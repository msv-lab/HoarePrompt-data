Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the misunderstanding of how the ingredients are combined. According to the problem, the goal is to maximize the value of the final ingredient by combining ingredients in a strategic way. However, the current implementation simply sorts the list of ingredient values and combines them in a sequential manner without considering the optimal strategy for maximizing the final value.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of two values, but the way the ingredients are combined does not ensure that the final value is maximized. Specifically, the code always combines the smallest remaining ingredient with the next smallest one, which does not necessarily lead to the maximum possible value of the final ingredient.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
500 300 200
```
The correct output should be `375`, but the current implementation will produce a different result. Here's how the current implementation works:
1. Sorts the list: `[200, 300, 500]`
2. Combines `200` and `300`: `(200 + 300) / 2 = 250`
3. Combines `250` and `500`: `(250 + 500) / 2 = 375`

However, the optimal strategy would be:
1. Combine `300` and `500`: `(300 + 500) / 2 = 400`
2. Combine `200` and `400`: `(200 + 400) / 2 = 300`

This shows that the current implementation does not always produce the maximum possible value of the final ingredient. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
