You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have a pot and N ingredients. Each ingredient has a real number parameter called value, and the value of the i-th ingredient (1 \leq i \leq N) is v_i.

When you put two ingredients in the pot, they will vanish and result in the formation of a new ingredient. The value of the new ingredient will be (x + y) / 2 where x and y are the values of the ingredients consumed, and you can put this ingredient again in the pot.

After you compose ingredients in this way N-1 times, you will end up with one ingredient. Find the maximum possible value of this ingredient.

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 50
* 1 \leq v_i \leq 1000
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
v_1 v_2 \ldots v_N


Output

Print a decimal number (or an integer) representing the maximum possible value of the last ingredient remaining.

Your output will be judged correct when its absolute or relative error from the judge's output is at most 10^{-5}.

Examples

Input

2
3 4


Output

3.5


Input

3
500 300 200


Output

375


Input

5
138 138 138 138 138


Output

138
Program:
```
n = int(input())
v = [float(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
v.sort()
result = v[0]
for i in range(1, n):
    result = func_1(result, v[i])
print(result)

def func_1(a, b):
    return (a + b) / 2


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `a` and a list of integers `b`. The integer `a` represents the number of ingredients and must be between 2 and 50 inclusive. The list `b` contains integers representing the values of the ingredients, each between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and the length of `b` is equal to `a`. The function returns the value of `(a + sum(b)) / 2`. However, the actual implementation of the function sums the integer `a` with the entire list `b` instead of summing the elements of `b` and then dividing by 2. This results in incorrect behavior because the sum of an integer and a list is not defined in Python. Therefore, the function will raise a `TypeError` when executed.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
