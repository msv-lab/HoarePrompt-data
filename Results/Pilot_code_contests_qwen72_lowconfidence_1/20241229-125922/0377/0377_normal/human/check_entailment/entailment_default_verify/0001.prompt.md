You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have a pot and N ingredients. Each ingredient has a real number parameter called value, and the value of the i-th ingredient (1 \leq i \leq N) is v_i.

When you put two ingredients in the pot, they will vanish and result in the formation of a new ingredient. The value of the new ingredient will be (x + y) / 2 where x and y are the values of the ingredients consumed, and you can put this ingredient again in the pot.

After you compose ingredients in this way N-1 times, you will end up with one ingredient. Find the maximum possible value of this ingredient.

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 50
* 1 \leq v_i \leq 1000
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
v_1 v_2 \ldots v_N


Output

Print a decimal number (or an integer) representing the maximum possible value of the last ingredient remaining.

Your output will be judged correct when its absolute or relative error from the judge's output is at most 10^{-5}.

Program:
```
n = int(input())
v = [float(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
v.sort()
result = v[0]
for i in range(1, n):
    result = func_1(result, v[i])
print(result)

def func_1(a, b):
    return (a + b) / 2


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This will cause the program to fail in Python 3 environments. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the input values are very close to each other, which could lead to precision issues due to floating-point arithmetic. However, the primary issue is the use of `raw_input()`, which makes the program incorrect for Python 3 environments.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `a` and a list of integers `b`. The integer `a` represents the number of ingredients and must be between 2 and 50 inclusive. The list `b` contains integers representing the values of the ingredients, each between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and the length of `b` is equal to `a`. The function returns the value of `(a + sum(b)) / 2`. However, the actual implementation of the function sums the integer `a` with the entire list `b` instead of summing the elements of `b` and then dividing by 2. This results in incorrect behavior because the sum of an integer and a list is not defined in Python. Therefore, the function will raise a `TypeError` when executed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
