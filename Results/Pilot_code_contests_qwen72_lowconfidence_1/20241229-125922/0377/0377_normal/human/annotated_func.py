#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of ingredients N such that 2 <= a <= 50, and b is a list of integers representing the values of the ingredients v_i such that 1 <= v_i <= 1000 and len(b) = a.
def func_1(a, b):
    return (a + b) / 2
    #The program returns the value of (a + sum(b)) / 2, where 'a' is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, representing the number of ingredients, and 'b' is a list of integers each between 1 and 1000 inclusive, with the length of 'b' equal to 'a'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `a` and a list of integers `b`. The integer `a` represents the number of ingredients and must be between 2 and 50 inclusive. The list `b` contains integers representing the values of the ingredients, each between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and the length of `b` is equal to `a`. The function returns the value of `(a + sum(b)) / 2`. However, the actual implementation of the function sums the integer `a` with the entire list `b` instead of summing the elements of `b` and then dividing by 2. This results in incorrect behavior because the sum of an integer and a list is not defined in Python. Therefore, the function will raise a `TypeError` when executed.
