The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. `a` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, representing the number of ingredients. `b` is a list of integers, each between 1 and 1000 inclusive, with the length of `b` equal to `a`. The function returns the value of `(a + sum(b)) / 2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `a` and a list of integers `b`. It returns the value of `(a + sum(b)) / 2`, where `a` is between 2 and 50 inclusive, and `b` is a list of integers each between 1 and 1000 inclusive, with the length of `b` equal to `a`.**
