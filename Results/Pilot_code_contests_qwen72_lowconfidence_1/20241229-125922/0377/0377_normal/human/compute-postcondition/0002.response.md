Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `a` and a list of integers `b`. The integer `a` represents the number of ingredients and must be between 2 and 50 inclusive. The list `b` contains integers representing the values of the ingredients, each between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and the length of `b` is equal to `a`. The function returns the value of `(a + sum(b)) / 2`. However, the actual implementation of the function sums the integer `a` with the entire list `b` instead of summing the elements of `b` and then dividing by 2. This results in incorrect behavior because the sum of an integer and a list is not defined in Python. Therefore, the function will raise a `TypeError` when executed. **
