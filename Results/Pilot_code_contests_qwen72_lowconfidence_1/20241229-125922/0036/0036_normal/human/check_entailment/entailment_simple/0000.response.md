Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**: 
   - The program uses `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. Since the problem description does not specify the Python version, we should assume Python 3 for modern standards. Therefore, using `raw_input()` is incorrect.

2. **Handling of Broken Steps**:
   - The program marks broken steps by setting `dp[a] = -1`. However, when calculating the number of ways to reach a step, it checks if `dp[step - prev] >= 0` to ensure it's not a broken step. This is correct, but the final result is not properly handled for broken steps. Specifically, if the last step (N) is broken, the program should output 0, but it does not explicitly check this condition.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The problem description requires the result to be printed modulo \(1,000,000,007\). The program does this correctly by using `print(dp[n] % 1000000007)`.

### Corrected Program:

To address these issues, the program should use `input()` instead of `raw_input()`, and it should explicitly handle the case where the last step is broken.

```python
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split(' '))
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    broken_steps = set()
    
    for i in range(m):
        a = int(input())
        broken_steps.add(a)
    
    for step in range(1, n + 1):
        if step in broken_steps:
            dp[step] = 0
            continue
        
        ans = 0
        
        for prev in [1, 2]:
            if step - prev >= 0 and step - prev not in broken_steps:
                ans += dp[step - prev]
        
        dp[step] = ans
        
    print(dp[n] % 1000000007)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `input()` is used instead of `raw_input()` to ensure compatibility with Python 3.
   
2. **Broken Steps**:
   - A set `broken_steps` is used to store the indices of the broken steps. This allows for efficient lookups when checking if a step is broken.
   - The program sets `dp[step] = 0` if the step is broken, ensuring that no paths through broken steps are counted.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - The dynamic programming array `dp` is updated correctly, and the modulo operation is applied to the final result.

By making these changes, the program now correctly handles all aspects of the problem description and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
