Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case when the first step (step 1) is broken. According to the problem constraints, the first step can be broken, but the program initializes `dp[0] = 1`, assuming that the starting point (step 0) is always valid and the first step can always be reached. However, if the first step is broken, there should be no way to reach any subsequent steps, and the result should be 0. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3 1
1
```
The output should be 0 because the first step is broken, and thus, it is impossible to reach the top step (step 3). However, the program will incorrectly compute a non-zero value for `dp[1]` and proceed to calculate the number of ways to reach the top step, leading to an incorrect result.
