Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function reads two integers `N` and `M` from the input.
   - It initializes a list `dp` of size `N + 1` with all elements set to 0, except `dp[0]` which is set to 1. This represents the base case where there is exactly one way to stay at the 0th step (doing nothing).

2. **Marking Broken Steps**:
   - The function reads `M` unique integers representing the broken steps and sets `dp[a[i]]` to -1 for each broken step. This ensures that these steps are not considered in the dynamic programming calculations.

3. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**:
   - The function iterates through each step from 1 to `N`.
   - For each step, if `dp[step]` is -1 (indicating a broken step), it skips the calculation for that step.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of ways to reach the current step by summing the values of `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` if they are non-negative and within bounds. This correctly accounts for the possible moves of climbing one or two steps at a time.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The function prints the value of `dp[N]` modulo 1000000007, which gives the number of ways to reach the top step while avoiding broken steps.

### Edge Cases:
- **No Obstacles (M = 0)**: The program correctly handles this case by initializing all `dp` values as 0 except `dp[0]` and then calculating the number of ways to reach each step normally.
- **Only One Step (N = 1)**: The program correctly handles this case by setting `dp[1]` to 1 if it is not a broken step, otherwise, it sets `dp[1]` to 0.
- **All Steps Broken**: If all steps are broken, the program correctly sets `dp[step]` to -1 for all broken steps and ultimately prints 0 for `dp[N]`.

### Correctness Verification:
- The program adheres to the constraints and handles all edge cases as described in the problem.
- The dynamic programming approach ensures that the solution is efficient and correct for large inputs (up to \(10^5\) steps).
- The use of modulo 1000000007 ensures that the result fits within the required output format.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
