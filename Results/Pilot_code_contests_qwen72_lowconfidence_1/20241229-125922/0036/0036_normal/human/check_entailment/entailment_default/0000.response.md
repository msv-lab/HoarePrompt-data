Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a few issues that prevent it from being correct in every potential case:

1. **Handling of Broken Steps**: The code sets `dp[a[i]]` to `-1` for broken steps. However, it does not handle the case where the first step (step 1) or the second step (step 2) is broken correctly. If either of these steps is broken, the initial steps of the dynamic programming (DP) array will not be initialized correctly, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Initialization of DP Array**: The DP array is initialized with `dp[0] = 1`, which is correct because there is exactly one way to stay at the ground (0th step). However, if the first step (1) or the second step (2) is broken, the code should explicitly handle these cases to ensure that the DP array is initialized correctly.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The code does not handle the edge case where the first step (1) or the second step (2) is broken. If either of these steps is broken, the number of ways to reach the next steps will be affected, and the code should account for this.

Here is a revised version of the code that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    dp = [0 for i in range(0, n + 1)]
    dp[0] = 1
    broken_steps = set(int(input()) for _ in range(m))
    
    if 1 not in broken_steps:
        dp[1] = 1
    
    for step in range(2, n + 1):
        if step not in broken_steps:
            dp[step] = (dp[step - 1] + dp[step - 2]) % 1000000007
    
    print(dp[n] % 1000000007)
```

In this revised version:
- A set `broken_steps` is used to store the broken steps for quick lookup.
- The DP array is initialized correctly, and the first step (1) is checked to see if it is broken.
- The loop starts from step 2, and for each step, it checks if the step is broken before updating the DP array.

This revised version ensures that the code handles all potential cases correctly, including edge cases where the first or second step is broken. Therefore, the original code is incorrect.
