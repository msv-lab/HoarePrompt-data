Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the 0-th step is broken. According to the problem description, the 0-th step is the starting point, and if it is broken, there should be no way to start climbing the stairs, resulting in 0 ways to reach the top. However, the program initializes `dp[0] = 1`, assuming the 0-th step is always safe. This assumption leads to incorrect results when the 0-th step is broken.

Example:
```
Input:
1 1
0

Expected Output:
0

Actual Output:
1
```

In this example, the 0-th step is broken, so there should be no way to start climbing, but the program incorrectly outputs 1.
