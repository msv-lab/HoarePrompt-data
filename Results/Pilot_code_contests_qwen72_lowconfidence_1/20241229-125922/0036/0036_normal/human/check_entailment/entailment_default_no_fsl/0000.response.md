Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical issue that causes it to produce incorrect results in certain cases. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the transition between steps when a step is marked as broken. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly initializes the `dp` array with zeros and sets `dp[0]` to 1.
   - It reads the broken steps and marks them as `-1` in the `dp` array.

2. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through each step from 1 to `N`.
   - For each step, if the step is marked as broken (`dp[step] == -1`), it skips the calculation for that step.
   - For non-broken steps, it calculates the number of ways to reach that step by summing the values of `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` if they are non-negative.

3. **Issue with Broken Steps**:
   - The problem arises when the program encounters a broken step. When a step is marked as broken, the program sets `dp[step]` to `-1` and skips the calculation for that step.
   - However, the program does not properly handle the transition to subsequent steps. For example, if step `i` is broken, the program should ensure that `dp[i+1]` and `dp[i+2]` cannot be reached directly from step `i`. Instead, it continues to calculate `dp[i+1]` and `dp[i+2]` based on previous steps, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails

Consider the following input:
```
6 1
3
```

- The expected output is `4` because the only way to reach step 6 without stepping on step 3 is by taking the following sequences of steps:
  - 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
  - 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6
  - 0 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
  - 0 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6

However, the program will incorrectly calculate the number of ways to reach step 6 because it does not properly account for the broken step at step 3. This leads to an incorrect result.

### Corrected Approach

To fix this issue, the program should ensure that if a step is broken, the subsequent steps that depend on that broken step are not counted. One way to do this is to set `dp[step]` to 0 instead of -1 and handle the transition more carefully.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0] = 1
    broken = set()
    for i in range(m):
        a = int(input())
        broken.add(a)
    for step in range(1, n + 1):
        if step in broken:
            dp[step] = 0
        else:
            dp[step] = (dp[step - 1] + dp[step - 2]) % 1000000007
    print(dp[n])
```

This corrected version ensures that broken steps are handled correctly, and the dynamic programming transitions are updated accordingly.
