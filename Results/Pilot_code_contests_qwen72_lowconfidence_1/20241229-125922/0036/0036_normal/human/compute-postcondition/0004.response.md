The code snippet `a = int(raw_input())` assigns the value of the user input (converted to an integer) to the variable `a`. This changes the value of `a` from being a list of `M` unique integers to a single integer provided by the user. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `dp[0]` is 1, `i` is 0**
