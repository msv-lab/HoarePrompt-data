To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given Conditions:
- `N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5.
- `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1.
- `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i.
- `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`.
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `ans` is 0.
- If `dp[step]` is less than 0, the program will proceed to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the current iteration.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for prev in [1, 2]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will iterate over the list `[1, 2]`. This means the loop will execute exactly twice, regardless of the initial state of the variables.
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - The loop will always execute because the list `[1, 2]` has two elements, and the loop will iterate over these elements.
   - However, the behavior inside the loop might depend on the values of `dp[step]` and other variables, but the loop itself will always run.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop will always execute regardless of the initial state of the variables (other than the loop variable `prev`), no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop runs. The loop will execute exactly twice, iterating over the values 1 and 2.

### Final State:
State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`, `i` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `prev` will be 1 or 2 during the loop iterations.**
