To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `N` is an integer where \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\).
- `M` is an integer where \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\).
- `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of `M` unique integers where \(1 \leq a[i] \leq N-1\) and \(a[i] < a[i+1]\) for all valid \(i\).
- `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each `a[i]` in the list `a`.
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `step` is `k + 1`.
- `prev` is 2.
- If `step - prev` is non-negative and `dp[step - prev]` is non-negative, `ans` is set to `dp[step - prev] + dp[k - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for prev in [1, 2]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the values `[1, 2]` for the variable `prev`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `prev` is 2.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `prev` needs to be updated to the next value in the list `[1, 2]`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Current State**:
   - `prev` is 2.
   - The loop will execute for the next value of `prev` in the list `[1, 2]`.

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - The next value of `prev` in the list `[1, 2]` is 1 (since the list is cyclic).

### Updated State:
- `prev` is 1.
- All other variables (`N`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `dp`, `i`, `step`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`, `i` is `m - 1`, `step` is `k + 1`, `prev` is 1, `ans` remains 0**.
