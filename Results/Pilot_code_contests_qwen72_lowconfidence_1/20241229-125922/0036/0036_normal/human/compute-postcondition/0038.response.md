To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `N` is an integer where \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\).
- `M` is an integer where \(0 \leq M \leq N-1\).
- `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of `M` unique integers where \(1 \leq a[i] \leq N-1\) and \(a[i] < a[i+1]\) for all valid \(i\).
- `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each `a[i]` in the list `a`.
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `step` is `k + 1`.
- If `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0`, then `ans` is `dp[step - prev]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for prev in [1, 2]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. The loop iterates over the list `[1, 2]`, meaning `prev` will take the values 1 and 2 in successive iterations.
2. The loop condition is implicit in the list `[1, 2]`, so the loop will execute exactly twice regardless of the state variables.

### State Adjustments:
- Since the loop iterates over a fixed list `[1, 2]`, the only state variable that changes within the loop is `prev`.
- The state variables `N`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `dp`, `i`, and `step` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the state does not need to be adjusted in terms of the variables `N`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `dp`, `i`, or `step`. The only variable that changes is `prev`.

### Final State:
State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`, `i` is `m - 1`, `step` is `k + 1`, `prev` is 2, `ans` is 0 if the conditions are not met, otherwise it is `dp[step - prev]`**.
