The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the first element of the list `dp`.

- `dp[0]` was initially `0` (as part of the list of `n + 1` zeros).
- After executing the code, `dp[0]` is now `1`.

All other elements in `dp` remain `0`. The values of `N`, `M`, `n`, `m`, and the list `a` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **N is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, M is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `dp[0]` is 1.**
