The code snippet `dp[a] = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the element at index `a` in the list `dp`. Given that `dp[a]` was already `-1` in the initial state, this operation does not change the value of `dp[a]`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to any of the variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[a]` is -1, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 1**
