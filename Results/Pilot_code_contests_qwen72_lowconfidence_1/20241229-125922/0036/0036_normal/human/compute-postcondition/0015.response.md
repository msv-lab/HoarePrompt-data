The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the loop body and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. This does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow control within the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1
- `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1
- `m` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i
- `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`
- `i` is `m - 1`
- The current value of `dp[step]` is less than 0

After executing the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program will proceed to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`, `i` is `m - 1`, the current value of `dp[step]` is less than 0, and the program will proceed to the next iteration of the loop.**
