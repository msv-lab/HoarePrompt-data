The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of a loop to end prematurely and the control to pass to the next iteration of the loop. However, since no loop or conditional structure (like `if`, `while`, or `for`) is explicitly mentioned or implied in the provided context, the `continue` statement would not have any effect on the variables or the flow outside such structures.

Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the program execution continues from the next line of code following the `continue` statement, which is not provided here.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1, `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`, `dp[step]` is `ans`, `i` is `m - 1`, `step` is `k + 2`, `ans` is the sum of `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` if both `step - 1` and `step - 2` are non-negative and `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` are non-negative, otherwise `ans` remains 0.**
