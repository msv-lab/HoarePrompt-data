The code `dp[step] = ans` updates the `dp` list at index `step` with the value of `ans`. Let's analyze the impact:

- `N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 (unchanged).
- `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1 (unchanged).
- `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1 (unchanged).
- `m` is an input integer (unchanged).
- `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i (unchanged).
- `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a` (partially updated).
- `i` is `m - 1` (unchanged).
- `step` is `k + 1` (unchanged).
- `ans` is the sum of `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` if both `step - 1` and `step - 2` are non-negative and `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` are non-negative. If any of these conditions are not met, `ans` remains 0.

Given this, the `dp` list is updated at index `step` with the value of `ans`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1, `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`, and `dp[step]` is `ans`, `i` is `m - 1`, `step` is `k + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` if both `step - 1` and `step - 2` are non-negative and `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` are non-negative, otherwise `ans` remains 0.**
