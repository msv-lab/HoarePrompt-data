To ensure the for loop can execute, we need to verify the conditions and initial states based on the given information. Let's break down the requirements:

1. **Range of `step`**: The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` inclusive. This means `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
2. **Initial value of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to `m - 1`. For the loop to start, this initialization is already given and does not need adjustment.
3. **List `a`**: The list `a` contains `M` unique integers where `1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1` and `a[i] < a[i+1]` for all valid `i`. This condition is already met as per the given state.
4. **List `dp`**: The list `dp` is initialized to `n + 1` zeros, with `dp[0]` set to 1 and `dp[a[i]]` set to -1 for each `a[i]` in the list `a`. This initialization is also given and does not need adjustment.

Given these points, the only condition that needs to be ensured for the loop to execute is that `n` must be at least 1. The other variables and lists are already correctly initialized according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`, `i` is `m - 1`**.
