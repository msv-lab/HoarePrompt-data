The code snippet updates the `dp` list at the index `step` with the value of `ans`. Let's break down the impact:

1. **`dp[step]`**: This is updated to the value of `ans`.
2. **`ans`**: This is calculated as the sum of `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` under the conditions that both indices are non-negative and their corresponding `dp` values are non-negative.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5.
- `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1.
- `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i.
- `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`.
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `step` is `k + 2`.
- `ans` is the sum of `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` if both `step - 1 >= 0` and `dp[step - 1] >= 0`, and `step - 2 >= 0` and `dp[step - 2] >= 0`.

Let's calculate the new state:

- **`dp[step]`** is updated to `ans`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`, `i` is `m - 1`, `step` is `k + 2`, `ans` is the sum of `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` if both `step - 1 >= 0` and `dp[step - 1] >= 0`, and `step - 2 >= 0` and `dp[step - 2] >= 0`, `dp[step]` is `ans`.**
