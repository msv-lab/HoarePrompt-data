The code snippet `ans += dp[step - prev]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value found at `dp[step - prev]`. Let's break down the state changes:

- `step` is `k + 1`, but `k` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, `step` is used as an index in the list `dp`.
- `prev` is 1.
- `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each `a[i]` in the list `a`.

Given this, `step - prev` simplifies to `k` (since `step` is `k + 1` and `prev` is 1).

To find the value of `dp[step - prev]`:
- If `k` is 0, then `dp[step - prev]` is `dp[0]`, which is 1.
- If `k` is one of the values in the list `a`, then `dp[k]` is -1.
- Otherwise, `dp[k]` is 0.

Thus, the value added to `ans` depends on whether `k` is 0, in the list `a`, or neither.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`, `i` is `m - 1`, `step` is `k + 1`, `prev` is 1, `ans` is 0 + `dp[k]` (where `dp[k]` is 1 if `k` is 0, -1 if `k` is in the list `a`, and 0 otherwise)**.
