The code snippet `dp[a] = -1` sets the element at index `a` in the list `dp` to `-1`. Since `dp` was initially a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` set to 1 and `dp[a]` set to -1, this assignment does not change the value of `dp[a]` because it was already -1.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with no changes to the variables or their values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[a]` is -1, `i` is 1**
