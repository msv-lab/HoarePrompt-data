The code snippet `dp[a] = -1` updates the value of the element in the list `dp` at the index `a` to `-1`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[a]` is -1, `i` is 0**
