The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `dp[step - prev]`. Since `prev` is 2, the expression `step - prev` simplifies to `step - 2`. Therefore, `ans` is incremented by `dp[step - 2]`.

All other variables (`N`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `dp`, `i`, `step`, `prev`) retain their initial properties as described in the precondition.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `dp`, `i`, `step`, `prev` retain their initial properties, `ans` is incremented by `dp[step - 2]`**
