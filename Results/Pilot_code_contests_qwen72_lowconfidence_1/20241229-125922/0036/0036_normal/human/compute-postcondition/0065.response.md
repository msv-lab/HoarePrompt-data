Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two integers `N` and `M` from the input, followed by `M` unique integers `a[i]` (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1) which are strictly increasing. It initializes a list `dp` of size `N + 1` with all elements set to 0, except `dp[0]` which is set to 1. For each `a[i]` read from the input, it sets `dp[a[i]]` to -1. Then, it iterates through each step from 1 to `N`, and for each step, it calculates the number of ways to reach that step by summing the values of `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` if they are non-negative. If `dp[step]` is -1, it skips the calculation for that step. Finally, it prints the value of `dp[N]` modulo 1000000007. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when `M` is 0 (no obstacles), and when `N` is 1 (only one step). The function handles these cases correctly by ensuring that `dp[0]` is always 1 and by skipping steps marked as obstacles. **
