To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given State:
- `N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5.
- `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1.
- `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i.
- `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`.
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `step` is `k + 1`.
- `ans` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for prev in [1, 2]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate over the list `[1, 2]`. This means the loop will run exactly twice, regardless of the values of the other variables.
2. **Dependencies**: The loop does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the state (e.g., `N`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `dp`, `i`, `step`, `ans`). The loop will always execute because it is iterating over a fixed list `[1, 2]`.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop will always execute regardless of the values of the variables provided in the state, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`, `i` is `m - 1`, `step` is `k + 1`, `ans` is 0**
