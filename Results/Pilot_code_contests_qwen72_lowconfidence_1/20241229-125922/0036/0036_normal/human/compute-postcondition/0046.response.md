To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5.
- `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1.
- `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i.
- `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1, `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`.
- `dp[step]` is `ans`.
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `step` is `k + 1`.
- `ans` is the sum of `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` if both `step - 1` and `step - 2` are non-negative and `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` are non-negative, otherwise `ans` remains 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for step in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `step` is in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `step` must be incremented by 1 and still be within the range [1, n].

2. **State Adjustments**:
   - `step` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - `ans` needs to be recalculated based on the new value of `step`.

### Adjusted State:
- `N` remains the same.
- `M` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `m` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `dp` remains the same, but `dp[step]` will be updated in the loop body.
- `i` remains the same.
- `step` is incremented by 1.
- `ans` is recalculated as follows:
  - If both `step - 1` and `step - 2` are non-negative and `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` are non-negative, then `ans` is the sum of `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]`.
  - Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

### Final State:
State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1, `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`, `dp[step]` is `ans`, `i` is `m - 1`, `step` is `k + 2`, `ans` is the sum of `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` if both `step - 1` and `step - 2` are non-negative and `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` are non-negative, otherwise `ans` remains 0.**
