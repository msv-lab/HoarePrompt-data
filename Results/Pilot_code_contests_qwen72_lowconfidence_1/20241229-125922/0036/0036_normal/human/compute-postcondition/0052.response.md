The code snippet `ans += dp[step - prev]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `dp[step - prev]` to it. Let's break down the changes:

1. **Variables and their Initial Values:**
   - `N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5.
   - `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1.
   - `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i.
   - `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1, `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`.
   - `dp[step]` is 0.
   - `i` is `m - 1`.
   - `step` is `k + 2`.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `prev` will be 1 and then 2 during the loop execution.
   - `step - prev` is non-negative.
   - `dp[step - prev]` is non-negative.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The value of `ans` is updated by adding `dp[step - prev]` to it.
   - Since `prev` is 1 initially, `step - prev` is `k + 2 - 1 = k + 1`.
   - `dp[step - prev]` is `dp[k + 1]`.

3. **Calculating the New Value of `ans`:**
   - `ans` was initially 0.
   - After the operation, `ans` becomes `0 + dp[k + 1]`.

4. **Output State:**
   - All other variables remain unchanged.
   - `ans` is now `dp[k + 1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1, `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`, `dp[step]` is 0, `i` is `m - 1`, `step` is `k + 2`, `ans` is `dp[k + 1]`, `prev` will be 1 and then 2 during the loop execution, `step - prev` is non-negative, and `dp[step - prev]` is non-negative.**
