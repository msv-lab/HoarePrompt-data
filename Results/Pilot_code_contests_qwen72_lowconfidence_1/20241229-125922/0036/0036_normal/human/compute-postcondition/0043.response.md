Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`, `i` is `m - 1`, `step` is `k + 1`, `prev` is 1, and `ans` is 0. If `step - prev` is non-negative and `dp[step - prev]` is non-negative, `ans` is updated to 0 + `dp[k]` (where `dp[k]` is 1 if `k` is 0, -1 if `k` is in the list `a`, and 0 otherwise).***
