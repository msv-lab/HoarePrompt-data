The code snippet `ans += dp[step - prev]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value at index `step - prev` in the list `dp`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1
- `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1
- `m` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i
- `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`
- `i` is `m - 1`
- `prev` is 1
- `ans` is 0

We need to determine the value of `dp[step - prev]` and update `ans` accordingly. However, the variable `step` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `ans`. Instead, we can describe the change in terms of the undefined variable `step`.

The value of `ans` is updated by adding the value at index `step - 1` in the list `dp`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`, `i` is `m - 1`, `prev` is 1, `ans` is `0 + dp[step - 1]`**
