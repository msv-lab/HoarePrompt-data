The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `dp[step - prev]` to it. Here's the detailed reasoning:

- `ans` was initially 0.
- `prev` is either 1 or 2.
- `step - prev` is non-negative, ensuring that `step - prev` is within the bounds of the `dp` list.
- `dp[step - prev]` is non-negative, meaning it can be 0 or a positive integer.

Since `dp[step - prev]` is non-negative, `ans` will be updated to include this value. The new value of `ans` will be the sum of its previous value (which was 0) and `dp[step - prev]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`, `i` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `dp[step - prev]`, `prev` will be 1 or 2 during the loop iterations, and `step - prev` is non-negative and `dp[step - prev]` is non-negative.**
