To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement:

### Given State Before the Loop:
- `N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5.
- `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1.
- `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i.
- `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1, `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`.
- `dp[step]` is 0.
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `step` is `k + 2`.
- `ans` is 0.
- If `dp[step] < 0`, then `dp[step]` remains -1.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for prev in [1, 2]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The for loop iterates over the list `[1, 2]`, which means it will execute twice, once with `prev` set to 1 and once with `prev` set to 2.
- The loop does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the state except for the list `[1, 2]`.

### States That Need to Be Adjusted:
- Since the loop will always execute because it is iterating over a fixed list `[1, 2]`, no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop runs.
- However, we should ensure that the initial state is consistent with the conditions given.

### Final State:
- `N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5.
- `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1.
- `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i.
- `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1, `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`.
- `dp[step]` is 0.
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `step` is `k + 2`.
- `ans` is 0.
- If `dp[step] < 0`, then `dp[step]` remains -1.
- `prev` will be 1 and then 2 during the loop execution.
