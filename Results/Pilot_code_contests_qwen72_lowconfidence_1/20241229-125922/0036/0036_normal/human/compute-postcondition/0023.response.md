The code snippet `ans += dp[step - prev]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `dp[step - prev]` to it, provided that `step - prev` is a valid index in the `dp` list and the value at that index is non-negative.

Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
   - `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1
   - `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1
   - `m` is an input integer
   - `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i
   - `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`
   - `i` is `m - 1`
   - `ans` is either `dp[step - prev]` if `step - prev` is non-negative and `dp[step - prev]` is non-negative, or remains 0 otherwise
   - `prev` is 2

2. **Impact of the Code Snippet:**
   - `ans` is updated by adding `dp[step - prev]` to its current value.
   - `step - prev` must be a valid index in the `dp` list, meaning `0 ≤ step - prev < len(dp)`.
   - `dp[step - prev]` must be non-negative for the addition to take place.

3. **Calculating the Result:**
   - `prev` is 2.
   - `step` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we assume it is a valid index in the `dp` list.
   - If `step - prev` is a valid index and `dp[step - prev]` is non-negative, `ans` is updated.

Given the initial state, let's assume `step` is a valid index in the `dp` list and `step - prev` is also a valid index. Let's denote `step - prev` as `index`.

- If `dp[index]` is non-negative, `ans` is updated to `ans + dp[index]`.
- If `dp[index]` is negative, `ans` remains unchanged.

Since `ans` was initially either `dp[step - prev]` (if `step - prev` is non-negative and `dp[step - prev]` is non-negative) or 0, the new value of `ans` will be:

- If `dp[step - prev]` is non-negative, `ans` becomes `dp[step - prev] + dp[step - prev]`.
- If `dp[step - prev]` is negative, `ans` remains 0.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`, `i` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `dp[step - prev] + dp[step - prev]` if `dp[step - prev]` is non-negative, or remains 0 otherwise, `prev` is 2**.
