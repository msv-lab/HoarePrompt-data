The code initializes a list `dp` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0.

Output State: **N is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, M is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
