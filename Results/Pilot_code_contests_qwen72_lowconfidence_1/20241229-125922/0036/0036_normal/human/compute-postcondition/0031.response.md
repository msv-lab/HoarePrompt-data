The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the current iteration of the loop should be skipped and the next iteration should begin immediately. Given the initial state, the values of `N`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `dp`, `i`, and `step` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`, `i` is `m - 1`, `step` is `k + 1`, `dp[step]` is `dp[step - 1] + dp[step - 2]` if both `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` are non-negative and within bounds; otherwise, `dp[step]` is 0.**
