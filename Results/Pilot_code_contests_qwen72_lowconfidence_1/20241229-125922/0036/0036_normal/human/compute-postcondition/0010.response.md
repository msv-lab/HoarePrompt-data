The value of `a` is updated to the integer value entered by the user through the `raw_input()` function. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[a]` is -1, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 1**
