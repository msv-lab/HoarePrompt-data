The code snippet provided prints the value of `dp[n]` modulo 1000000007. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- The value of `dp[n]` is calculated based on the initial conditions and the dynamic programming (DP) logic described in the initial state.
- The value of `dp[n]` is then taken modulo 1000000007 and printed.

Since the code only involves printing and does not modify any variables, the state of the variables remains unchanged. However, the value of `dp[n]` is computed and printed, which affects the output but not the state.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[a[i]]` is -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`, and for each `step` from 1 to `n`, `dp[step]` is the sum of `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` if both are non-negative and within bounds; otherwise, `dp[step]` is 0, `i` is `m - 1`. The value of `dp[n] % 1000000007` has been printed.**
