To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and its effects on the variables step by step.

### Initial State:
- `N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5.
- `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i.
- `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`.
- `i` is `m - 1`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for step in range(1, n + 1):
    if dp[step] < 0:
        continue
    ans = 0
    for prev in [1, 2]:
        if step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0:
            ans += dp[step - prev]
    dp[step] = ans
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates from `step = 1` to `step = n`.
   - For each `step`, if `dp[step]` is less than 0 (i.e., `dp[step]` is -1), the loop continues to the next iteration.
   - If `dp[step]` is non-negative, the loop calculates `ans` by summing up the values of `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` if they are within bounds and non-negative.
   - Finally, `dp[step]` is set to the value of `ans`.

2. **Final State**:
   - After the loop finishes, `dp` will be updated such that each `dp[step]` for `1 ≤ step ≤ n` will be the sum of `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` if both are non-negative and within bounds. If either `dp[step - 1]` or `dp[step - 2]` is -1, `dp[step]` will remain 0.
   - The values of `N`, `M`, `n`, `m`, and `a` will remain unchanged.
   - The value of `i` will remain `m - 1`.

### Output State:
**`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[a[i]]` is -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`, and for each `step` from 1 to `n`, `dp[step]` is the sum of `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` if both are non-negative and within bounds; otherwise, `dp[step]` is 0, `i` is `m - 1`.**
