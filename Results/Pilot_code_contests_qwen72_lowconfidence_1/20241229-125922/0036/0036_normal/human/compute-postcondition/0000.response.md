The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them by a space, and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. This operation updates the values of `n` and `m` from their initial descriptions to the actual input values.

Output State: **N is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, M is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i.**
