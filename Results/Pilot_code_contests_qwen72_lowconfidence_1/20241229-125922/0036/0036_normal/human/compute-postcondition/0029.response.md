The code snippet assigns the value of `ans` to `dp[step]`. To determine the exact value of `dp[step]`, we need to consider the conditions under which `ans` was calculated:

- `ans` is the sum of `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` if both are non-negative and within bounds (i.e., `step - 1` and `step - 2` are valid indices in `dp`).
- If either `dp[step - 1]` or `dp[step - 2]` is out of bounds or negative, `ans` is 0.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5.
- `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1.
- `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i.
- `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`.
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `ans` is the sum of `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` if both are non-negative and within bounds; otherwise, `ans` is 0.

Let's analyze the impact of the code snippet:

1. `dp[step]` is updated to the value of `ans`.
2. The value of `ans` depends on the values of `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]`.

If both `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` are within bounds and non-negative, then:
- `ans` = `dp[step - 1] + dp[step - 2]`.

If either `dp[step - 1]` or `dp[step - 2]` is out of bounds or negative, then:
- `ans` = 0.

Therefore, the updated value of `dp[step]` will be either `dp[step - 1] + dp[step - 2]` or 0, depending on the conditions.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`, `i` is `m - 1`, `dp[step]` is `dp[step - 1] + dp[step - 2]` if both `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` are non-negative and within bounds; otherwise, `dp[step]` is 0.**
