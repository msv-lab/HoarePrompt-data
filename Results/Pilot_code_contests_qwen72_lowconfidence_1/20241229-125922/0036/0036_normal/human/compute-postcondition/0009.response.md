To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5.
   - `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
   - `dp[0]` is 1.
   - `dp[a]` is -1.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(0, m):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `m`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - Additionally, `m` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Increment `i` from 1 to 2.
   - Ensure `m` is greater than 1.

Given these adjustments, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[a]` is -1, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 1**
