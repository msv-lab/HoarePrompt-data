The code snippet `ans += dp[step - prev]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value at index `step - prev` from the list `dp`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5.
- `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1.
- `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i.
- `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`.
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `step` is `k + 1`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `(step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0)`

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. **Condition Check**: The condition `(step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0)` ensures that the index `step - prev` is non-negative and that the value at this index in `dp` is non-negative.
2. **Update `ans`**: If the condition is true, `ans` is updated by adding the value at `dp[step - prev]`.

Since the condition is given as true, the value at `dp[step - prev]` is added to `ans`.

Given that `ans` was initially 0, the new value of `ans` will be `dp[step - prev]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `M` is an integer where 0 ≤ M ≤ N-1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of M unique integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ N-1 and a[i] < a[i+1] for all valid i, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[a[i]]` being -1 for each a[i] in the list `a`, `i` is `m - 1`, `step` is `k + 1`, `ans` is `dp[step - prev]`, and `(step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0)`**
