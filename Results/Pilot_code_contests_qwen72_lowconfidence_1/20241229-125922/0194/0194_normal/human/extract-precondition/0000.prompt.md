You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Vasya's telephone contains n photos. Photo number 1 is currently opened on the phone. It is allowed to move left and right to the adjacent photo by swiping finger over the screen. If you swipe left from the first photo, you reach photo n. Similarly, by swiping right from the last photo you reach photo 1. It takes a seconds to swipe from photo to adjacent.

For each photo it is known which orientation is intended for it — horizontal or vertical. Phone is in the vertical orientation and can't be rotated. It takes b second to change orientation of the photo.

Vasya has T seconds to watch photos. He want to watch as many photos as possible. If Vasya opens the photo for the first time, he spends 1 second to notice all details in it. If photo is in the wrong orientation, he spends b seconds on rotating it before watching it. If Vasya has already opened the photo, he just skips it (so he doesn't spend any time for watching it or for changing its orientation). It is not allowed to skip unseen photos.

Help Vasya find the maximum number of photos he is able to watch during T seconds.

Input

The first line of the input contains 4 integers n, a, b, T (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ T ≤ 109) — the number of photos, time to move from a photo to adjacent, time to change orientation of a photo and time Vasya can spend for watching photo.

Second line of the input contains a string of length n containing symbols 'w' and 'h'. 

If the i-th position of a string contains 'w', then the photo i should be seen in the horizontal orientation.

If the i-th position of a string contains 'h', then the photo i should be seen in vertical orientation.

Output

Output the only integer, the maximum number of photos Vasya is able to watch during those T seconds.

Note

In the first sample test you can rotate the first photo (3 seconds), watch the first photo (1 seconds), move left (2 second), rotate fourth photo (3 seconds), watch fourth photo (1 second). The whole process takes exactly 10 seconds.

Note that in the last sample test the time is not enough even to watch the first photo, also you can't skip it.
