Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads four integers `n`, `a`, `b`, and `T` from the input.
   - It then reads a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'w' and 'h'.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program creates a list `costs` where each element represents the time cost to process each photo. If the photo is in the wrong orientation ('w'), the cost is `b + 1` (time to rotate and watch). If the photo is in the correct orientation ('h'), the cost is `1` (time to watch).

3. **Leftward Movement:**
   - The program starts from the first photo and moves leftward, accumulating the time cost until it exceeds `T`.
   - It keeps track of the maximum number of photos that can be watched starting from the first photo and moving leftward.

4. **Rightward Movement:**
   - The program then starts from the first photo and moves rightward, accumulating the time cost.
   - For each photo moved rightward, it adjusts the leftward movement to ensure the total time does not exceed `T`.
   - It updates the maximum number of photos that can be watched by considering both leftward and rightward movements.

5. **Result Calculation:**
   - The program ensures that the result does not exceed `n` (the total number of photos).
   - It prints the maximum number of photos that can be watched within the given time `T`.

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Time Constraints:** The program correctly handles the time constraints by ensuring that the total time spent on moving and watching photos does not exceed `T`.
- **Orientation Handling:** The program correctly accounts for the additional time needed to rotate photos that are in the wrong orientation.
- **Movement Logic:** The program correctly simulates moving both left and right from the first photo, ensuring that the maximum number of photos is considered.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases where no photos can be watched within the given time limit, returning `0` in such cases.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `4 2 3 10`, `wwhw`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: The program correctly identifies that Vasya can watch the first and fourth photos within the given time.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `5 2 4 13`, `hhwhh`
  - Output: `4`
  - Explanation: The program correctly identifies that Vasya can watch the first, second, third, and fifth photos within the given time.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `5 2 4 1000`, `hhwhh`
  - Output: `5`
  - Explanation: The program correctly identifies that Vasya can watch all photos within the given time.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `3 1 100 10`, `whw`
  - Output: `0`
  - Explanation: The program correctly identifies that Vasya cannot watch any photos within the given time.

In conclusion, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
