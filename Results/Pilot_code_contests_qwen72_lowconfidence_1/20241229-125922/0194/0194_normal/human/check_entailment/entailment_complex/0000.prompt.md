You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vasya's telephone contains n photos. Photo number 1 is currently opened on the phone. It is allowed to move left and right to the adjacent photo by swiping finger over the screen. If you swipe left from the first photo, you reach photo n. Similarly, by swiping right from the last photo you reach photo 1. It takes a seconds to swipe from photo to adjacent.

For each photo it is known which orientation is intended for it — horizontal or vertical. Phone is in the vertical orientation and can't be rotated. It takes b second to change orientation of the photo.

Vasya has T seconds to watch photos. He want to watch as many photos as possible. If Vasya opens the photo for the first time, he spends 1 second to notice all details in it. If photo is in the wrong orientation, he spends b seconds on rotating it before watching it. If Vasya has already opened the photo, he just skips it (so he doesn't spend any time for watching it or for changing its orientation). It is not allowed to skip unseen photos.

Help Vasya find the maximum number of photos he is able to watch during T seconds.

Input

The first line of the input contains 4 integers n, a, b, T (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ T ≤ 109) — the number of photos, time to move from a photo to adjacent, time to change orientation of a photo and time Vasya can spend for watching photo.

Second line of the input contains a string of length n containing symbols 'w' and 'h'. 

If the i-th position of a string contains 'w', then the photo i should be seen in the horizontal orientation.

If the i-th position of a string contains 'h', then the photo i should be seen in vertical orientation.

Output

Output the only integer, the maximum number of photos Vasya is able to watch during those T seconds.

Note

In the first sample test you can rotate the first photo (3 seconds), watch the first photo (1 seconds), move left (2 second), rotate fourth photo (3 seconds), watch fourth photo (1 second). The whole process takes exactly 10 seconds.

Note that in the last sample test the time is not enough even to watch the first photo, also you can't skip it.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, b, T are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^9. The string s has a length of n and consists of characters 'w' and 'h'.
def func():
    n, a, b, t = map(int, raw_input().split())
    costs = [(1 if ch == 'h' else b + 1) for ch in raw_input().strip()]
    best = 0
    left_t = -a
    left_pos = n
    while True:
        left_pos -= 1
        
        if left_pos == -1 or left_t + a + costs[left_pos] > t:
            left_pos += 1
            break
        
        left_t += a + costs[left_pos]
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `left_pos` is the maximum index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] <= t` or 0 if no such index exists, `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[left_pos]` for all valid indices, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, and `best` remain unchanged
    right_t = -a
    right_pos = -1
    while True:
        right_pos += 1
        
        if right_pos == n or right_t + a + costs[right_pos] > t:
            break
        
        right_t += a + costs[right_pos]
        
        left_t += a
        
        while left_pos != n and right_t + left_t > t:
            left_t -= a + costs[left_pos]
            left_pos += 1
        
        best = max(best, 1 + right_pos + n - left_pos)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `right_pos` is the last index where `right_t + a + costs[right_pos] <= t` or `n` if the loop breaks due to `right_pos == n`, `right_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i` from `0` to `right_pos`, `left_pos` is the smallest index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] > t` or `n` if no such index exists, `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i < left_pos` plus the accumulated `a` values added during the loop, `best` is the maximum value of `best` calculated as `max(best, 1 + right_pos + n - left_pos)`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, and `costs` remain unchanged.
    best = min(n, best)
    print(best)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads four integers (`n`, `a`, `b`, `T`) and a string `s` from standard input. It then calculates the maximum number of characters in the string `s` (which consists of 'w' and 'h') that can be processed under certain cost constraints. The cost for processing each character 'w' is `b + 1`, and the cost for each character 'h' is `1`. The total allowed cost is `T`, and the function also accounts for an additional fixed cost `a` for each character processed. The function prints the maximum number of characters that can be processed without exceeding the total allowed cost `T`. If no characters can be processed within the cost limit, the function prints `0`. The function does not return any value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
