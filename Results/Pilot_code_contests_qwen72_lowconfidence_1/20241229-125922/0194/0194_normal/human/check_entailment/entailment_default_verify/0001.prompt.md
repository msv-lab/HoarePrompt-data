You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya's telephone contains n photos. Photo number 1 is currently opened on the phone. It is allowed to move left and right to the adjacent photo by swiping finger over the screen. If you swipe left from the first photo, you reach photo n. Similarly, by swiping right from the last photo you reach photo 1. It takes a seconds to swipe from photo to adjacent.

For each photo it is known which orientation is intended for it — horizontal or vertical. Phone is in the vertical orientation and can't be rotated. It takes b second to change orientation of the photo.

Vasya has T seconds to watch photos. He want to watch as many photos as possible. If Vasya opens the photo for the first time, he spends 1 second to notice all details in it. If photo is in the wrong orientation, he spends b seconds on rotating it before watching it. If Vasya has already opened the photo, he just skips it (so he doesn't spend any time for watching it or for changing its orientation). It is not allowed to skip unseen photos.

Help Vasya find the maximum number of photos he is able to watch during T seconds.

Input

The first line of the input contains 4 integers n, a, b, T (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ T ≤ 109) — the number of photos, time to move from a photo to adjacent, time to change orientation of a photo and time Vasya can spend for watching photo.

Second line of the input contains a string of length n containing symbols 'w' and 'h'. 

If the i-th position of a string contains 'w', then the photo i should be seen in the horizontal orientation.

If the i-th position of a string contains 'h', then the photo i should be seen in vertical orientation.

Output

Output the only integer, the maximum number of photos Vasya is able to watch during those T seconds.

Note

In the first sample test you can rotate the first photo (3 seconds), watch the first photo (1 seconds), move left (2 second), rotate fourth photo (3 seconds), watch fourth photo (1 second). The whole process takes exactly 10 seconds.

Note that in the last sample test the time is not enough even to watch the first photo, also you can't skip it.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, a, b, t) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    costs = [1 if ch == 'h' else b + 1 for ch in raw_input().strip()]
    best = 0
    left_t = -a
    left_pos = n
    while True:
        left_pos -= 1
        if left_pos == -1 or left_t + a + costs[left_pos] > t:
            left_pos += 1
            break
        left_t += a + costs[left_pos]
    right_t = -a
    right_pos = -1
    while True:
        right_pos += 1
        if right_pos == n or right_t + a + costs[right_pos] > t:
            break
        right_t += a + costs[right_pos]
        left_t += a
        while left_pos != n and right_t + left_t > t:
            left_t -= a + costs[left_pos]
            left_pos += 1
        best = max(best, 1 + right_pos + n - left_pos)
    best = min(n, best)
    print(best)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program seems to handle all the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program appears to be correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input values for `n`, `a`, `b`, and `T` using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. It then reads the orientation string and calculates the cost for each photo based on whether it needs to be rotated or not.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost for each photo is calculated as `1` if the photo is already in the correct orientation (`'h'`), or `b + 1` if it needs to be rotated (`'w'`).

3. **Left and Right Movement**:
   - The program uses two loops to simulate moving left and right from the starting photo (photo 1).
   - For each direction, it keeps track of the total time spent (`left_t` and `right_t`) and the current position (`left_pos` and `right_pos`).
   - It ensures that the total time does not exceed `T` by breaking out of the loop if the next move would exceed the available time.

4. **Optimal Path Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum number of photos that can be watched by considering both left and right movements.
   - It adjusts the positions and times to ensure that the total time spent is within the limit `T`.

5. **Result Output**: The final result is the maximum number of photos that can be watched, which is printed at the end.

The program appears to handle edge cases and different scenarios correctly, such as:
- When the time is not enough to watch even the first photo.
- When the photos are in different orientations.
- When the time is sufficient to watch all photos.

Given the thorough handling of the problem requirements and the absence of any obvious logical errors, the program is deemed correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads four integers (`n`, `a`, `b`, `T`) and a string `s` from standard input. It then calculates the maximum number of characters in the string `s` (which consists of 'w' and 'h') that can be processed under certain cost constraints. The cost for processing each character 'w' is `b + 1`, and the cost for each character 'h' is `1`. The total allowed cost is `T`, and the function also accounts for an additional fixed cost `a` for each character processed. The function prints the maximum number of characters that can be processed without exceeding the total allowed cost `T`. If no characters can be processed within the cost limit, the function prints `0`. The function does not return any value.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
