Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program seems to handle all the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program appears to be correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input values for `n`, `a`, `b`, and `T` using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. It then reads the orientation string and calculates the cost for each photo based on whether it needs to be rotated or not.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost for each photo is calculated as `1` if the photo is already in the correct orientation (`'h'`), or `b + 1` if it needs to be rotated (`'w'`).

3. **Left and Right Movement**:
   - The program uses two loops to simulate moving left and right from the starting photo (photo 1).
   - For each direction, it keeps track of the total time spent (`left_t` and `right_t`) and the current position (`left_pos` and `right_pos`).
   - It ensures that the total time does not exceed `T` by breaking out of the loop if the next move would exceed the available time.

4. **Optimal Path Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum number of photos that can be watched by considering both left and right movements.
   - It adjusts the positions and times to ensure that the total time spent is within the limit `T`.

5. **Result Output**: The final result is the maximum number of photos that can be watched, which is printed at the end.

The program appears to handle edge cases and different scenarios correctly, such as:
- When the time is not enough to watch even the first photo.
- When the photos are in different orientations.
- When the time is sufficient to watch all photos.

Given the thorough handling of the problem requirements and the absence of any obvious logical errors, the program is deemed correct.
