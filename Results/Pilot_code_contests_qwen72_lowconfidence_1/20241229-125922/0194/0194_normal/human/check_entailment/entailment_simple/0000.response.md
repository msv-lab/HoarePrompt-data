Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `raw_input()` to read input, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This would cause the program to fail if run in a Python 3 environment, which is more commonly used today.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Time Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the time spent on moving between photos and changing their orientation, but it does not correctly account for the time spent watching photos. Specifically, the program assumes that each photo takes `1` second to watch, but it does not handle the case where the photo is already seen and should be skipped without spending any time.

3. **Incorrect Window Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the maximum number of photos Vasya can watch using a sliding window approach. However, the logic for adjusting the window (`left_pos` and `right_pos`) is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where the total time exceeds `T` and does not ensure that the photos are watched in the correct order.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if `T` is very small and not enough to watch even the first photo, the program might still return a non-zero value, which is incorrect.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the input:
```
3 1 100 10
whw
```
- According to the problem description, Vasya cannot watch any photos because the time required to rotate the first photo and watch it (101 seconds) exceeds the available time `T = 10` seconds.
- The program, however, might incorrectly return a non-zero value due to the flawed logic in the sliding window calculation.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in several key areas, particularly in handling the time calculations and edge cases. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.
