According to the code, the loop is a `while True:` loop, which means it will always execute unless there is a break condition within the loop body. Since the loop condition is always true, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the first iteration of the loop to proceed.

State: **`left_pos` is the maximum index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] <= t` or 0 if no such index exists, `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[left_pos]` for all valid indices, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, and `best` remain unchanged, `right_t` is `-a`, `right_pos` is `-1`**
