The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently within. The values of the variables are not altered by this statement itself. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that we note the program breaks out of the most immediate loop or conditional structure.

Output State: **`left_pos` is the maximum index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] <= t` or `n` if no such index exists, `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i < left_pos` plus `a`, `right_t` is `costs[0]`, `right_pos` is `1`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, and `best` is `max(best, 1 + n - left_pos)`, `right_t + left_t > t` if `left_pos < n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
