The value of `left_t` is incremented by `a`. All other variables and conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left_pos` is the maximum index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] <= t` or 0 if no such index exists, `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[left_pos]` for all valid indices plus `a`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, and `best` remain unchanged, `right_t` is `costs[right_pos]`, `right_pos` is `0`. If `right_pos` is equal to `n` or the current value of `right_t + a + costs[right_pos]` is greater than `t`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
