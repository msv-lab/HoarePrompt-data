The code snippet `left_t = -a` assigns the negation of `a` to the variable `left_t`. The initial state specifies that `a` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000. Therefore, `left_t` will be a negative integer ranging from -1 to -1000.

The values of `n`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, and `best` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5), `a` is an input integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), `b` is an input integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^9), `s` has a length of `n` and consists of characters 'w' and 'h', `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is `1` if the corresponding character in `s` is 'h', and `b + 1` otherwise, `best` is 0, `left_t` is `-a`**
