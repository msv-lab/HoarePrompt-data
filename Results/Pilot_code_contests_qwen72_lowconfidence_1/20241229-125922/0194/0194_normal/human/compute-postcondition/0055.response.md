The value of `left_t` is decremented by `a + costs[left_pos]`. The initial value of `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i < (left_pos + 1)` plus `a`. After decrementing, the new value of `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i < left_pos` plus `a`.

The initial state specifies that `left_pos` is `left_pos + 1`, which means that before the decrement, `left_pos` was incremented by 1. Thus, the current value of `left_pos` is used in the calculation.

Other variables such as `right_t`, `right_pos`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, and `costs` remain unchanged. The value of `best` remains as `max(best, 1 + n - (left_pos + 1))`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `left_pos` is `left_pos + 1`, `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i < left_pos` plus `a`, `right_t` is `costs[0] + a + costs[1]`, `right_pos` is `1`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, and `costs` are unchanged, `best` is `max(best, 1 + n - (left_pos + 1))`.
Output State: **`left_pos` is `left_pos + 1`, `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i < left_pos` plus `a`, `right_t` is `costs[0] + a + costs[1]`, `right_pos` is `1`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, and `costs` are unchanged, `best` is `max(best, 1 + n - (left_pos + 1))`**
