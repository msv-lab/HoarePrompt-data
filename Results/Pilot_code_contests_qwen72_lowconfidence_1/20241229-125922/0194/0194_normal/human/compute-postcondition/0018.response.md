For a `while True` loop, the condition is always true, and thus, the loop will always execute unless there's an explicit break statement inside the loop. Since no specific conditions are given that would terminate the loop, and the only changes in the state are to `left_pos` and `left_t`, we can assume that these changes do not affect the loop's ability to execute again.

Given this, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will continue to run as long as it is not explicitly broken out of.

State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, `best` remain unchanged, `left_pos` is decreased by 1, `left_t` is set to `left_t + a + costs[left_pos]`**
