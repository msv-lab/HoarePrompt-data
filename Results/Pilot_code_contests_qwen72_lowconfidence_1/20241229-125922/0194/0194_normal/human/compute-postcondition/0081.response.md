The code snippet `print(best)` outputs the value of the variable `best`. This operation does not modify any variables in the program, so the state of all other variables remains unchanged. The only effect is the printing of the value of `best`.

Output State: **`right_pos` is the last index where `right_t + a + costs[right_pos] <= t` or `n` if the loop breaks due to `right_pos == n`, `right_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i` from `0` to `right_pos`, `left_pos` is the smallest index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] > t` or `n` if no such index exists, `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i < left_pos` plus the accumulated `a` values added during the loop, `best` is the minimum of `n` and the maximum value of `best` calculated as `max(best, 1 + right_pos + n - left_pos)`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, and `costs` remain unchanged.**
