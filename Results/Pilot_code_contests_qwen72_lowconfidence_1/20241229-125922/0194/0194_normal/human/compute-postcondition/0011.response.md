The value of `left_t` is updated by adding `a + costs[left_pos]` to its current value. The previous value of `left_t` was `-a`, so the new value of `left_t` is `-a + a + costs[left_pos]`, which simplifies to `costs[left_pos]`.

Since `costs[left_pos]` depends on the character at position `left_pos` in the string `s`, if the character at `left_pos` is 'h', `costs[left_pos]` is `1`, otherwise, it is `b + 1`.

Therefore, the new value of `left_t` is either `1` (if `s[left_pos]` is 'h') or `b + 1` (if `s[left_pos]` is 'w').

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, `best`, `left_pos`) remain unchanged unless the condition `left_pos == -1 or left_t + a + costs[left_pos] > t` is met, in which case `left_pos` is set to `0` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, since the code snippet does not evaluate this condition, these changes do not occur.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, `best`, `left_pos` are unchanged, `left_t` is `1` if `s[left_pos]` is 'h' or `b + 1` if `s[left_pos]` is 'w'.**
