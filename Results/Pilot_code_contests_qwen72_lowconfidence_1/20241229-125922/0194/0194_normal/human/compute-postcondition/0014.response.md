The value of `left_pos` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left_pos` was decreased by 1, so incrementing it by 1 brings it back to its original value. The value of `left_t` depends on the character at `s[left_pos + 1]` and will be updated accordingly if `left_pos` changes. However, since `left_pos` is incremented by 1, the condition for `left_t` will now check `s[left_pos + 1]` which is the same as `s[left_pos]` before the increment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, `best` remain unchanged, `left_pos` is restored to its original value, `left_t` is `1` if `s[left_pos]` is 'h' or `b + 1` if `s[left_pos]` is 'w'.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, `best` remain unchanged, `left_pos` is restored to its original value, `left_t` is `1` if `s[left_pos]` is 'h' or `b + 1` if `s[left_pos]` is 'w'.**
