For the given task, the `while` loop is defined as `while True:`. This means the loop condition is always true and does not depend on any specific state variables. Therefore, the loop can always execute one more time without any modifications to the state.

State: **`left_pos` is the smallest index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] > t` or `n` if no such index exists, `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i < left_pos` plus `2a`, `right_t` is `costs[0] + a + costs[1]`, `right_pos` is `1`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, and `costs` are unchanged, `best` is `max(best, 2 + n - left_pos)`**
