The code snippet sets `right_pos` to `-1`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the updated output state includes this new value for `right_pos` while keeping all other variables and conditions unchanged.

Output State: **`left_pos` is the maximum index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] <= t` or 0 if no such index exists, `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[left_pos]` for all valid indices, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, and `best` remain unchanged, `right_t` is `-a`, `right_pos` is `-1`**
