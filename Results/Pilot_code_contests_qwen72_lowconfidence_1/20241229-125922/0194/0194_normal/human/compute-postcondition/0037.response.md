To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop:

1. **Condition 1:** `left_pos != n`
2. **Condition 2:** `right_t + left_t > t`

### Current State:
- `left_t` is `left_t - (a + costs[left_pos-1])`
- `left_pos` is the maximum index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos-1] <= t` or 0 if no such index exists plus 1
- `right_t` is `costs[0]`
- `right_pos` is `0`
- `right_t + (left_t - (a + costs[left_pos-1])) > t`
- `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, and `best` remain unchanged

### Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `left_pos != n`**
   - For the loop to continue, `left_pos` must not be equal to `n`.
   - Given the current state, `left_pos` is the maximum index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos-1] <= t` or 0 if no such index exists plus 1.
   - This condition will naturally hold as long as there is a valid `left_pos` that satisfies the inequality.

2. **Condition 2: `right_t + left_t > t`**
   - The current state indicates that `right_t + (left_t - (a + costs[left_pos-1])) > t`.
   - To ensure this condition holds for the next iteration, we need to ensure that `right_t` and `left_t` are updated appropriately.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`left_pos`**: It should be updated to the next valid position where the condition `left_t + a + costs[left_pos-1] <= t` holds.
- **`left_t`**: It should be updated to reflect the new value after the next valid `left_pos` is chosen.
- **`right_t`**: It should be updated to reflect any changes in the right side of the window.

However, since the problem does not specify the exact loop body, we can only assume that the loop body will update `left_pos` and `left_t` accordingly.

### Conclusion:
Given the current state, the loop can proceed if:
- `left_pos` is updated to the next valid position.
- `left_t` is updated to reflect the new value after the next valid `left_pos` is chosen.

Since the exact updates are not specified, we will assume the loop body will handle these updates correctly.

### Final State:
State: **`left_t` is `left_t - (a + costs[left_pos-1])`, `left_pos` is the maximum index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos-1] <= t` or 0 if no such index exists plus 1, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, and `best` remain unchanged, `right_t` is `costs[0]`, `right_pos` is `0`, and `right_t + (left_t - (a + costs[left_pos-1])) > t`**
