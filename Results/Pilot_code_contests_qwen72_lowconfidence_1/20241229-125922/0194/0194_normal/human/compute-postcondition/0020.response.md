The value of `left_pos` is incremented by 1, reversing the previous decrease by 1. The value of `left_t` is not affected by this code snippet. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, `best`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, `best` remain unchanged, `left_pos` is unchanged, `left_t` is `left_t + a + costs[left_pos - 1]`**
