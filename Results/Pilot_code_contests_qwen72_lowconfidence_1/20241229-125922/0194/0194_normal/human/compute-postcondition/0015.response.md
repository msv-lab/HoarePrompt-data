The `break` statement does not alter the values of any variables but causes the program to exit from the innermost loop or conditional structure it is within.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, `best` remain unchanged, `left_pos` is restored to its original value, `left_t` is `1` if `s[left_pos]` is 'h' or `b + 1` if `s[left_pos]` is 'w', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
