To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

```python
while left_pos != n and right_t + left_t > t:
```

### Breakdown of the Loop Condition:
1. **`left_pos != n`**: This condition ensures that `left_pos` is not equal to `n`. If `left_pos` is already equal to `n`, the loop will not execute.
2. **`right_t + left_t > t`**: This condition ensures that the sum of `right_t` and `left_t` is greater than `t`. If this condition is not met, the loop will not execute.

### Initial State:
- `left_pos` is the maximum index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] <= t` or 0 if no such index exists.
- `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[left_pos]` for all valid indices plus `a`.
- `right_t` is `costs[right_pos]`.
- `right_pos` is `0`.

### Analysis:
1. **`left_pos != n`**:
   - For the loop to execute, `left_pos` must not be equal to `n`.
   - If `left_pos` is 0 (as per the initial state), it is not equal to `n` (assuming `n` is a positive integer). Therefore, this part of the condition is satisfied.

2. **`right_t + left_t > t`**:
   - `right_t` is `costs[0]` (since `right_pos` is 0).
   - `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[left_pos]` for all valid indices plus `a`.
   - The loop will execute if the sum of `right_t` and `left_t` is greater than `t`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to make sure that `right_t + left_t > t`.
- Since `right_t` is `costs[0]` and `left_t` includes `a` and possibly some `costs[left_pos]`, we need to ensure that the sum of these values is greater than `t`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the loop will execute if `right_t + left_t > t`. Since `right_t` is `costs[0]` and `left_t` includes `a` and possibly some `costs[left_pos]`, we need to ensure that the sum of these values is greater than `t`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `right_t + left_t > t`.

### Final State:
State: **`left_pos` is the maximum index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] <= t` or 0 if no such index exists, `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[left_pos]` for all valid indices plus `a`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, and `best` remain unchanged, `right_t` is `costs[0]`, `right_pos` is `0`, and `right_t + left_t > t`**.
