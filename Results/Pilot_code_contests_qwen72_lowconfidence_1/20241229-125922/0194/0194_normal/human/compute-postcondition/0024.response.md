To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop terminates and how the variables change during each iteration. Let's analyze the loop step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5)
- `a` is an input integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000)
- `b` is an input integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000)
- `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^9)
- `s` has a length of `n` and consists of characters 'w' and 'h'
- `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is `1` if the corresponding character in `s` is 'h', and `b + 1` otherwise
- `best` is 0
- `left_t` is `-a`
- `left_pos` is `n`

### Loop Code:
```python
while True:
    left_pos -= 1
    if left_pos == -1 or left_t + a + costs[left_pos] > t:
        left_pos += 1
        break
    left_t += a + costs[left_pos]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Termination Conditions:**
   - The loop will terminate if `left_pos` reaches -1.
   - The loop will also terminate if adding `a + costs[left_pos]` to `left_t` would exceed `t`.

2. **Variable Updates:**
   - `left_pos` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - `left_t` is updated by adding `a + costs[left_pos]` in each iteration, unless the termination condition is met.

### Final Output State:
- **`left_pos`**: This will be the position where the loop terminated. It will be either 0 or a value such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] > t`.
- **`left_t`**: This will be the accumulated value of `left_t` after all valid iterations, which is the sum of `a + costs[left_pos]` for all positions processed.
- **Other Variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, `best`)**: These remain unchanged throughout the loop.

### Conclusion:
The loop processes the string `s` from the end towards the beginning, updating `left_t` until it either runs out of positions or exceeds the threshold `t`. The final state of the variables will be:

Output State: **`left_pos` is the maximum index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] <= t` or 0 if no such index exists, `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[left_pos]` for all valid indices, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, and `best` remain unchanged**.
