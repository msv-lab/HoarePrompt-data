Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, `best` remain unchanged. If `left_pos` is -1 or `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] > t`, `left_pos` is restored to its original value, `left_t` is `1` if `s[left_pos]` is 'h' or `b + 1` if `s[left_pos]` is 'w', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains as described in the precondition with `left_pos` decreased by 1 and `left_t` set to `1` if `s[left_pos + 1]` is 'h' or `b + 1` if `s[left_pos + 1]` is 'w'.***
