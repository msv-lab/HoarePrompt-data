To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop:

1. **Condition 1:** `left_pos != n`
   - This condition checks if `left_pos` has not reached the value of `n`.
   - Given that `left_pos` is `left_pos + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `left_pos` is still less than `n` for the loop to continue.

2. **Condition 2:** `right_t + left_t > t`
   - This condition checks if the sum of `right_t` and `left_t` is greater than `t`.
   - Given that `left_t` is `left_t - costs[left_pos - 1]` and `right_t` is `costs[0] + a + costs[1] + a + costs[2]` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that the sum of these values remains greater than `t`.

### Analysis:
- **`left_pos`**: After the previous iteration, `left_pos` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, `left_pos` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for this condition as long as `left_pos` is less than `n`.
- **`left_t`**: `left_t` is decremented by `costs[left_pos - 1]` at each iteration. To ensure the loop continues, `left_t` must be such that `right_t + left_t > t` holds true. Since `left_t` is being reduced, we need to ensure that the reduction does not cause the sum to drop below `t`.
- **`right_t`**: `right_t` is set to `costs[0] + a + costs[1] + a + costs[2]` at the end of the previous iteration. This value should remain unchanged for the loop to continue, assuming it contributes positively to the sum `right_t + left_t`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the following must hold true:
- `left_pos` must be less than `n`.
- The sum `right_t + left_t` must be greater than `t`.

Given that `left_pos` is already `left_pos + 1` and `left_t` is `left_t - costs[left_pos - 1]`, no further adjustments are needed for the loop to proceed. The state at the end of the previous iteration is sufficient to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`left_pos` is `left_pos + 1`, `left_t` is `left_t - costs[left_pos - 1]`, `right_t` is `costs[0] + a + costs[1] + a + costs[2]`, `right_pos` is `2`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, and `costs` are unchanged, `best` is `max(best, 2 + n - (left_pos - 1))`, and `right_t + left_t > t`**
