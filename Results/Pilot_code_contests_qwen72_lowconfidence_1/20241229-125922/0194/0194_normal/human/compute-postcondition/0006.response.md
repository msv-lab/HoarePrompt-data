The value of `left_pos` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `left_pos` is `n`, so after the decrement, `left_pos` becomes `n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5), `a` is an input integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), `b` is an input integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^9), `s` has a length of `n` and consists of characters 'w' and 'h', `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is `1` if the corresponding character in `s` is 'h', and `b + 1` otherwise, `best` is 0, `left_t` is `-a`, `left_pos` is `n - 1`**
