To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement:

```python
while left_pos != n and right_t + left_t > t:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `left_pos != n`**
   - This condition checks if `left_pos` has not reached the end of the array `costs`.
   - If `left_pos` is already equal to `n`, the loop will terminate.
   - Therefore, `left_pos` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue.

2. **Condition 2: `right_t + left_t > t`**
   - This condition checks if the sum of `right_t` and `left_t` exceeds `t`.
   - If this condition is not met, the loop will terminate.
   - Therefore, `right_t + left_t` must be greater than `t` for the loop to continue.

### Current State:
- `left_t` is `left_t - (a + costs[left_pos-1]) - (a + costs[left_pos])`
- `left_pos` is the maximum index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos-1] <= t` or 0 if no such index exists plus 2
- `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, and `best` remain unchanged
- `right_t` is `costs[0]`
- `right_pos` is `0`
- `right_t + (left_t - (a + costs[left_pos-1])) > t`

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`left_pos`**: Since `left_pos` is the maximum index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos-1] <= t` or 0 if no such index exists plus 2, we need to ensure that `left_pos` is less than `n` for the loop to continue. Therefore, `left_pos` must be less than `n`.
- **`right_t + left_t > t`**: The current state already satisfies this condition, as `right_t + (left_t - (a + costs[left_pos-1])) > t`.

### Conclusion:
No additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time, given the current state. The loop can proceed as long as `left_pos` is less than `n` and `right_t + left_t > t`.

State: **`left_t` is `left_t - (a + costs[left_pos-1]) - (a + costs[left_pos])`, `left_pos` is the maximum index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos-1] <= t` or 0 if no such index exists plus 2, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, and `best` remain unchanged, `right_t` is `costs[0]`, `right_pos` is `0`, and `right_t + (left_t - (a + costs[left_pos-1])) > t`**
