Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `b`, and `t` are input integers within their specified ranges. `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'w' and 'h'. `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is `1` if the corresponding character in `s` is 'h', and `b + 1` otherwise. `best` is 0, `left_t` is `-a`, and `left_pos` is `n - 1`. If `left_pos` is `-1` or the sum of `left_t + a + costs[left_pos]` exceeds `t`, `left_pos` is set to `0` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statements.***
