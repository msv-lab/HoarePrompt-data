The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it's clear that the function should accept four parameters: `n`, `a`, `b`, `T`, and a string `s`. 

- `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5, representing the length of the string `s`.
- `a`: An integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000.
- `b`: An integer where 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000.
- `T`: An integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^9.
- `s`: A string of length `n` consisting of characters 'w' and 'h'.

Given the lack of explicit return conditions, we assume the function processes these inputs and returns some computed result, but the exact nature of the return value is not specified in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters: `n`, `a`, `b`, `T`, and `s`. `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`, which consists of characters 'w' and 'h'. `a`, `b`, and `T` are integers within their respective ranges. The function returns a computed result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not detailed.**
