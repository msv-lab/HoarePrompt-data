For the given `while True:` loop, there are no conditions that would prevent the loop from executing one more time. The loop will continue indefinitely unless there is an explicit break or return statement within the loop body, which is not provided in the problem statement.

Since the loop condition `True` always evaluates to true, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the state remains unchanged.

State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, `best`, `left_pos` are unchanged, `left_t` is `1` if `s[left_pos]` is 'h' or `b + 1` if `s[left_pos]` is 'w'.**
