The provided code snippet updates the value of `left_pos` by incrementing it by 1. Let's analyze the impact of this operation:

- `left_pos` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `left_pos` is `left_pos + 1`.
- The other variables remain unchanged unless they are dependent on `left_pos` in a way that affects their values, which is not indicated here.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`left_pos` is `left_pos + 1`, `left_pos` must be less than `n - 1`, `left_t` is `left_t - costs[left_pos - 1] - a - costs[left_pos]`, `right_t` is `costs[0] + a + costs[1] + a + costs[2]`, `right_pos` is `2`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, and `costs` are unchanged, `best` is `max(best, 2 + n - (left_pos - 1))`.**

Output State: **`left_pos` is `left_pos + 1`, `left_pos` must be less than `n - 1`, `left_t` is `left_t - costs[left_pos - 1] - a - costs[left_pos]`, `right_t` is `costs[0] + a + costs[1] + a + costs[2]`, `right_pos` is `2`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, and `costs` are unchanged, `best` is `max(best, 2 + n - (left_pos - 1))`.**
