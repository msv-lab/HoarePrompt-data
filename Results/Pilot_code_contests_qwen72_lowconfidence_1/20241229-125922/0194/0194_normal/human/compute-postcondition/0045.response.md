Given the `while True:` loop, the loop condition always evaluates to `True`, meaning the loop will execute indefinitely unless there is an internal mechanism (such as a break statement) that stops it. Since no such mechanism is mentioned in the provided information, and the loop condition itself (`True`) does not depend on any of the variables in the state, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged:
State: **`left_pos` is the maximum index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] <= t` or `n` if no such index exists, `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i < left_pos` plus `a`, `right_t` is `costs[0]`, `right_pos` is `0`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, and `best` is `max(best, 1 + n - left_pos)`, `right_t + left_t > t` if `left_pos < n`.**
