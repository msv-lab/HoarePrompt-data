The value of `left_pos` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left_pos` is `left_pos + 1`, `left_t` is `left_t - costs[left_pos - 1]`, `right_t` is `costs[0] + a + costs[1] + a + costs[2]`, `right_pos` is `2`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, and `costs` are unchanged, `best` is `max(best, 2 + n - (left_pos - 1))`, and `right_t + left_t > t`**
