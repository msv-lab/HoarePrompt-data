To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```
while left_pos != n and right_t + left_t > t:
```

This means the loop will continue to execute as long as:
1. `left_pos` is not equal to `n`.
2. The sum of `right_t` and `left_t` is greater than `t`.

Given the current state:
- `left_pos` is `left_pos + 2`
- `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i < left_pos + 1` plus `a`
- `right_t` is `costs[0] + a + costs[1]`
- `right_pos` is `1`
- `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, and `costs` are unchanged
- `best` is `max(best, 1 + n - (left_pos + 2))`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `left_pos != n`**
   - For the loop to execute again, `left_pos` must still not be equal to `n`.
   - Since `left_pos` is `left_pos + 2`, we need to ensure that `left_pos + 2` is still less than `n`.

2. **Condition 2: `right_t + left_t > t`**
   - We need to ensure that the sum of `right_t` and `left_t` is still greater than `t`.
   - `right_t` is `costs[0] + a + costs[1]`, which remains unchanged.
   - `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i < left_pos + 1` plus `a`. After the previous iteration, `left_pos` is `left_pos + 2`, so `left_t` should be updated to include the new elements in the sum.

### Adjustments Needed:

1. **`left_pos`**:
   - To ensure `left_pos` is not equal to `n`, `left_pos` must be less than `n - 2` after the adjustment.

2. **`left_t`**:
   - `left_t` should be updated to include the new elements in the sum. Specifically, `left_t` should now be the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i < left_pos + 3` plus `a`.

### Final State:

State: **`left_pos` is `left_pos + 2` and must be less than `n - 2`, `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i < left_pos + 3` plus `a`, `right_t` is `costs[0] + a + costs[1]`, `right_pos` is `1`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, and `costs` are unchanged, `best` is `max(best, 1 + n - (left_pos + 2))`**
