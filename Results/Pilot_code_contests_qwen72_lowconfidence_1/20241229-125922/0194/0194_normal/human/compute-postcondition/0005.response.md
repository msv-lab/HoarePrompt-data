For the given `while True:` loop, the condition is always true, meaning the loop will execute at least once regardless of the program state. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to ensure the first iteration of the loop can proceed.

State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5), `a` is an input integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), `b` is an input integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^9), `s` has a length of `n` and consists of characters 'w' and 'h', `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is `1` if the corresponding character in `s` is 'h', and `b + 1` otherwise, `best` is 0, `left_t` is `-a`, `left_pos` is `n`**
