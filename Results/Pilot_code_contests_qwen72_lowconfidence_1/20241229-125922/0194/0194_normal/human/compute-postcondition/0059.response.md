The value of `left_pos` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, including `left_t`, `right_t`, `right_pos`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, and `costs`. The condition that `left_pos + 2` must be less than `n - 2` still holds. The value of `best` is also unchanged, which is `max(best, 1 + n - (left_pos + 2))`.

Output State: **`left_pos` is `left_pos + 3` and must be less than `n - 2`, `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i < left_pos + 3` excluding `left_pos` plus `a`, `right_t` is `costs[0] + a + costs[1]`, `right_pos` is `1`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, and `costs` are unchanged, `best` is `max(best, 1 + n - (left_pos + 2))`**
