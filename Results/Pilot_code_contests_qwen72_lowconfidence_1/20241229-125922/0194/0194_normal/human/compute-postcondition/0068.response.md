To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop:

1. **Condition 1:** `left_pos != n`
   - This condition checks if `left_pos` is not equal to `n`.
   - From the given state, `left_pos` is the smallest index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] > t` or `n` if no such index exists. For the loop to execute, `left_pos` must be less than `n`.

2. **Condition 2:** `right_t + left_t > t`
   - This condition checks if the sum of `right_t` and `left_t` is greater than `t`.
   - From the given state, `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i < left_pos` plus `2a` and is now `left_t + a`.
   - `right_t` is defined as `costs[0] + a + costs[1] + a + costs[right_pos]`, and `right_pos` is `2`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, both conditions must be true initially.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Adjusting `left_pos`:**
   - `left_pos` should be less than `n` for the loop to start.
   - Given that `left_pos` is the smallest index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] > t` or `n` if no such index exists, we need to ensure that such an index exists and is less than `n`.

2. **Adjusting `right_t + left_t > t`:**
   - We need to ensure that the sum of `right_t` and `left_t` is greater than `t`.
   - Given `right_t = costs[0] + a + costs[1] + a + costs[right_pos]` and `right_pos = 2`, we can calculate `right_t` as `costs[0] + a + costs[1] + a + costs[2]`.
   - `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i < left_pos` plus `2a` and is now `left_t + a`.

### Adjustments Needed:

- **Ensure `left_pos < n`:**
  - We need to ensure that there is at least one index `left_pos` where `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] > t` and this index is less than `n`.

- **Ensure `right_t + left_t > t`:**
  - We need to ensure that the sum of `right_t` and `left_t` is greater than `t`.

### Final State:

Given the above analysis, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that both conditions are met. Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`left_pos` is the smallest index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] > t` and `left_pos < n`, `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i < left_pos` plus `2a` and is now `left_t + a`, `right_t` is `costs[0] + a + costs[1] + a + costs[2]`, `right_pos` is `2`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, and `costs` are unchanged, `best` is `max(best, 2 + n - left_pos)`, and `right_t + left_t > t`**
