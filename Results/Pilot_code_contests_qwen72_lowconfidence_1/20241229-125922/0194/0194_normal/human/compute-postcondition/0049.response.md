The code snippet updates the value of `right_t` by adding `a + costs[right_pos]` to its current value.

- `right_t` was initially `costs[0]`.
- `right_pos` is initially `1`.

The new value of `right_t` is therefore `costs[0] + a + costs[1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged, but their conditions are still valid:

- `left_pos` is the maximum index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] <= t` or `n` if no such index exists.
- `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i < left_pos` plus `a`.
- `right_pos` is now `1` (unchanged).
- `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, and `costs` remain as they were.
- `best` is still `max(best, 1 + n - left_pos)`.
- The condition `right_t + left_t > t` if `left_pos < n` remains valid, but `right_t` has been updated.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`left_pos` is the maximum index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] <= t` or `n` if no such index exists, `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i < left_pos` plus `a`, `right_t` is `costs[0] + a + costs[1]`, `right_pos` is `1`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, and `costs` are unchanged, `best` is `max(best, 1 + n - left_pos)`, `right_t + left_t > t` if `left_pos < n`. If `right_pos == n` or `right_t + a + costs[right_pos] > t`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
