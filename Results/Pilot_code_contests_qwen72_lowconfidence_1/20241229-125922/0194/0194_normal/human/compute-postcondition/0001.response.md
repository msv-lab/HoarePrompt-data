The list comprehension creates a new list `costs` where each element corresponds to a character in the string `s`. For each character `ch` in `s`, if `ch` is 'h', the corresponding element in `costs` is `1`. Otherwise, the corresponding element is `b + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5)
- `a` is an input integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000)
- `b` is an input integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000)
- `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^9)
- `s` has a length of `n` and consists of characters 'w' and 'h'

After executing the code:
- `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is `1` if the corresponding character in `s` is 'h', and `b + 1` otherwise.

The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5), `a` is an input integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), `b` is an input integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^9), `s` has a length of `n` and consists of characters 'w' and 'h', `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is `1` if the corresponding character in `s` is 'h', and `b + 1` otherwise.**
