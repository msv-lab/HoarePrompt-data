The code snippet reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `t`. The initial state specifies that these variables are integers within certain ranges, and the string `s` has a length of `n` and consists of characters 'w' and 'h'. After executing the code, the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `t` are updated with the new values read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5), `a` is an input integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), `b` is an input integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^9), `s` has a length of `n` and consists of characters 'w' and 'h'.**
