The `break` statement causes an immediate exit from the innermost loop or conditional structure. Since the initial state indicates that `right_pos` is either equal to `n` or the current value of `right_t + a + costs[right_pos]` is greater than `t`, the `break` statement would cause an exit from the loop or conditional structure containing this condition.

Therefore, the values of the variables do not change, but the control flow is altered to exit the loop or conditional structure. The output state remains the same in terms of variable values, but includes the fact that we break out of the loop or conditional structure.

Output State: **`left_pos` is the maximum index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] <= t` or 0 if no such index exists, `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[left_pos]` for all valid indices, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, `costs`, and `best` remain unchanged, `right_t` is `-a`, `right_pos` is `0`, and either `right_pos` is equal to `n` or the current value of `right_t + a + costs[right_pos]` is greater than `t`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
