The value of `right_pos` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left_pos` is the smallest index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] > t` or `n` if no such index exists, `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i < left_pos` plus `2a`, `right_t` is `costs[0] + a + costs[1]`, `right_pos` is `2`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, and `costs` are unchanged, `best` is `max(best, 2 + n - left_pos)`**
