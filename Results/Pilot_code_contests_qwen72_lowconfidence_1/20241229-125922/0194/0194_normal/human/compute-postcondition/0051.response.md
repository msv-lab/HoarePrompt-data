To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

```python
while left_pos != n and right_t + left_t > t:
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `left_pos != n`**
   - This condition ensures that `left_pos` is not equal to `n`.
   - If `left_pos` is `n`, the loop will not execute.

2. **Condition 2: `right_t + left_t > t`**
   - This condition ensures that the sum of `right_t` and `left_t` is greater than `t`.
   - If this condition is false, the loop will not execute.

### Given State:
- `left_pos` is the maximum index such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] <= t` or `n` if no such index exists.
- `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i < left_pos` plus `2a`.
- `right_t` is `costs[0] + a + costs[1]`.
- `right_pos` is `1`.
- `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, and `costs` are unchanged.
- `best` is `max(best, 1 + n - left_pos)`.
- `right_t + left_t > t` if `left_pos < n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
1. **Ensure `left_pos != n`**:
   - For the loop to execute, `left_pos` must not be equal to `n`.
   - If `left_pos` is `n`, it means no valid index was found such that `left_t + a + costs[left_pos] <= t`. To ensure the loop executes, `left_pos` should be set to a value less than `n`.

2. **Ensure `right_t + left_t > t`**:
   - This condition is already given as true if `left_pos < n`.
   - Therefore, if `left_pos` is less than `n`, this condition will be satisfied.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to ensure that `left_pos` is less than `n`. The other conditions are already satisfied based on the given state.

### Final State:
State: **`left_pos` is less than `n`, `left_t` is the sum of `a + costs[i]` for all valid indices `i < left_pos` plus `2a`, `right_t` is `costs[0] + a + costs[1]`, `right_pos` is `1`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `s`, and `costs` are unchanged, `best` is `max(best, 1 + n - left_pos)`**
