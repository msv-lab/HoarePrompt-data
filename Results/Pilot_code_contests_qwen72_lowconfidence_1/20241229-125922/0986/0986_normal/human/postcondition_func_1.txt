The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_1` with the arguments 0 and 1, and returns the result of this call. The specific value returned by `func_2` depends on the implementation of `func_1`. After the function concludes, the program will have the result of `func_1(0, 1)` available as the return value of `func_2`. There are no side effects or modifications to external variables or state within `func_2`.
