Output State: **`v` is a non-negative integer, `color` is an integer, `colors[v]` is `color`, `es` is a list of lists, `es[v]` may contain any number of elements (including zero). For each `to` in `es[v]`, `colors[to]` is not equal to `color`. If `colors[to]` is 0, `func_1(to, -color)` must have returned `True` for the loop to complete without returning `False`.**
