The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `v` and `color`. `v` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the graph, and `color` is an integer representing a color value. The function checks the coloring of the graph based on the given vertex and color. Depending on the conditions related to the coloring and adjacency of the vertices, the function returns either `False` or `True`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `v` (a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the graph) and `color` (an integer representing a color value). It returns `False` in multiple cases and `True` in one specific case, based on the coloring and adjacency of the vertices.**
