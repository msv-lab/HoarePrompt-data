Postcondition: ***`v` is a non-negative integer, `color` is an integer, `colors[v]` is `color`, `es` is a list of lists, `es[v]` must contain at least three elements, `to` is the third element in `es[v]`, and `colors[to]` is not equal to `color`. If `colors[to]` is 0 and `func_1(to, -color)` returns False, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
