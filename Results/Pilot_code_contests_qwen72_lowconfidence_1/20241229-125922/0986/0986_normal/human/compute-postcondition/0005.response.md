Postcondition: ***`v` is a non-negative integer, `color` is an integer, `colors[v]` is now `color`, `es` is a list of lists where each sublist contains the indices of vertices adjacent to the vertex at the same index in `es`, `es[v]` must contain at least one element, `to` is the first element in `es[v]`, and `colors[to]` is not equal to `color`. Additionally, `colors[to]` is 0, and `func_1(to, -color)` returns `False`.***
