#State of the program right berfore the function call: v is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the graph, color is an integer representing a color value, colors is a list of integers where each element corresponds to the color of a vertex (0 indicates uncolored), and es is a list of lists where each sublist contains the indices of vertices adjacent to the vertex at the same index in es.
def func_1(v, color):
    colors[v] = color
    for to in es[v]:
        if colors[to] == color:
            return False
        
        if colors[to] == 0 and not func_1(to, -color):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `v` is a non-negative integer, `color` is an integer, `colors[v]` is `color`, `es` is a list of lists, `es[v]` may contain any number of elements (including zero). For each `to` in `es[v]`, `colors[to]` is not equal to `color`. If `colors[to]` is 0, `func_1(to, -color)` must have returned `True` for the loop to complete without returning `False`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` is designed to attempt to color a graph using a two-coloring scheme (i.e., using two different colors, typically represented by positive and negative values). The function takes two parameters: `v` (a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the graph) and `color` (an integer representing the color to be assigned to the vertex `v`). The function modifies the `colors` list, which stores the color of each vertex in the graph. The function returns `False` if it detects a conflict (i.e., an adjacent vertex already has the same color), indicating that the graph cannot be two-colored. If no conflicts are found and the coloring is successful, the function returns `True`.

### Summary of Function State After Execution:
-

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function func_2.
def func_2():
    return func_1(0, 1)
    #The program returns the result of calling `func_1` with arguments 0 and 1. The specific value returned depends on the implementation of `func_1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_1` with the arguments 0 and 1, and returns the result of this call. The specific value returned by `func_2` depends on the implementation of `func_1`. After the function concludes, the program will have the result of `func_1(0, 1)` available as the return value of `func_2`. There are no side effects or modifications to external variables or state within `func_2`.
