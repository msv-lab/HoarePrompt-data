The function `func_1` is designed to attempt to color a graph using a two-coloring scheme (i.e., using two different colors, typically represented by positive and negative values). The function takes two parameters: `v` (a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the graph) and `color` (an integer representing the color to be assigned to the vertex `v`). The function modifies the `colors` list, which stores the color of each vertex in the graph. The function returns `False` if it detects a conflict (i.e., an adjacent vertex already has the same color), indicating that the graph cannot be two-colored. If no conflicts are found and the coloring is successful, the function returns `True`.
