Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment accurately identifies that the provided program does not solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are focused on checking if the graph is bipartite, which is not relevant to the task of finding the maximum number of edges that can be added by connecting vertices that are exactly three edges apart. The output hints confirm that `func_2` simply calls `func_1` and returns its result, without implementing the required logic for adding edges or computing the number of edges that can be added. Therefore, the program is incomplete and does not meet the problem description.
