Final: **False**

Reason:
The original assessment is accurate because the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not designed to solve the problem described. The problem requires finding the maximum number of edges that can be added to a graph such that each added edge connects vertices that are exactly three edges apart in the original graph. However, the functions provided are attempting to perform a 2-coloring of the graph, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

The output hints confirm that `func_2` simply calls `func_1(0, 1)` and returns its result. This does not align with the problem's requirement to find the maximum number of edges that can be added based on the specified conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the problem description.
