You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Rng has a connected undirected graph with N vertices. Currently, there are M edges in the graph, and the i-th edge connects Vertices A_i and B_i.

Rng will add new edges to the graph by repeating the following operation:

* Operation: Choose u and v (u \neq v) such that Vertex v can be reached by traversing exactly three edges from Vertex u, and add an edge connecting Vertices u and v. It is not allowed to add an edge if there is already an edge connecting Vertices u and v.



Find the maximum possible number of edges that can be added.

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq M \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq A_i,B_i \leq N
* The graph has no self-loops or multiple edges.
* The graph is connected.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(v, color):
    colors[v] = color
    for to in es[v]:
        if colors[to] == color:
            return False
        if colors[to] == 0 and (not func_1(to, -color)):
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return func_1(0, 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not designed to solve the problem described. The problem requires finding the maximum number of edges that can be added to a graph such that each added edge connects vertices that are exactly three edges apart in the original graph. However, the functions provided seem to be attempting to perform a 2-coloring of the graph, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

For example, consider the first example input:
```
6 5
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
```
The correct output should be `4`, but the provided functions do not compute this value. Instead, they attempt to color the graph, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(N, M) = map(int, raw_input().split())
es = [[] for i in range(N)]
for i in range(M):
    (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    (a, b) = (a - 1, b - 1)
    es[a].append(b)
    es[b].append(a)
colors = [0 for i in range(N)]
if func_2():
    b = (sum(colors) + N) // 2
    w = N - b
    print(b * w - M)
else:
    all = N * (N - 1) // 2
    print(all - M)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: v is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the graph, color is an integer representing a color value, colors is a list of integers where each element corresponds to the color of a vertex (0 indicates uncolored), and es is a list of lists where each sublist contains the indices of vertices adjacent to the vertex at the same index in es.
def func_1(v, color):
    colors[v] = color
    for to in es[v]:
        if colors[to] == color:
            return False
        
        if colors[to] == 0 and not func_1(to, -color):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `v` is a non-negative integer, `color` is an integer, `colors[v]` is `color`, `es` is a list of lists, `es[v]` may contain any number of elements (including zero). For each `to` in `es[v]`, `colors[to]` is not equal to `color`. If `colors[to]` is 0, `func_1(to, -color)` must have returned `True` for the loop to complete without returning `False`.
    return True
    #The program returns True

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function func_2.
def func_2():
    return func_1(0, 1)
    #The program returns the result of calling `func_1` with arguments 0 and 1. The specific value returned depends on the implementation of `func_1`.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
