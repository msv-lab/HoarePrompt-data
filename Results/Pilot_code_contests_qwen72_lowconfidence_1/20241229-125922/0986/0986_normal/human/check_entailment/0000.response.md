Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not designed to solve the problem described. The problem requires finding the maximum number of edges that can be added to a graph such that each added edge connects vertices that are exactly three edges apart in the original graph. However, the functions provided seem to be attempting to perform a 2-coloring of the graph, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

For example, consider the first example input:
```
6 5
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
```
The correct output should be `4`, but the provided functions do not compute this value. Instead, they attempt to color the graph, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
