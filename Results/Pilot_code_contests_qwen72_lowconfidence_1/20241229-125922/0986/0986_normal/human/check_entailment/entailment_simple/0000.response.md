Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by using a bipartite graph coloring approach to determine the maximum number of additional edges that can be added. However, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Bipartite Graph Assumption**:
   - The program assumes that the graph is bipartite. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach (`func_1`) to color the graph and check if it can be colored with two colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
   - If the graph is bipartite, the program calculates the maximum number of edges that can be added by considering the product of the sizes of the two color sets minus the current number of edges.
   - However, the problem does not guarantee that the graph is bipartite. The graph can be any connected undirected graph, and the operation described in the problem (adding edges between vertices that are exactly three edges apart) does not necessarily imply that the graph is bipartite.

2. **Incorrect Calculation for Non-Bipartite Graphs**:
   - If the graph is not bipartite, the program falls back to calculating the total number of possible edges in a complete graph (`all = N * (N - 1) // 2`) and subtracts the current number of edges. This calculation is incorrect because it does not consider the specific operation of adding edges between vertices that are exactly three edges apart.
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number of edges that can be added by the specified operation, not just the maximum number of edges in a complete graph.

3. **Handling the Specific Operation**:
   - The program does not implement the specific operation of adding edges between vertices that are exactly three edges apart. It relies on a general bipartite graph assumption, which is not always applicable.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
5 5
1 2
2 3
3 1
5 4
5 1
```
- The graph is a cycle of length 3 (1-2-3-1) plus two additional vertices (4 and 5) connected to vertex 5.
- The program will attempt to color this graph and fail to recognize that it is not bipartite.
- The program will fall back to the incorrect calculation for a complete graph, leading to an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, it fails to implement the operation of adding edges between vertices that are exactly three edges apart and incorrectly handles non-bipartite graphs. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.
