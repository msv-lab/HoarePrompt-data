You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Rng has a connected undirected graph with N vertices. Currently, there are M edges in the graph, and the i-th edge connects Vertices A_i and B_i.

Rng will add new edges to the graph by repeating the following operation:

* Operation: Choose u and v (u \neq v) such that Vertex v can be reached by traversing exactly three edges from Vertex u, and add an edge connecting Vertices u and v. It is not allowed to add an edge if there is already an edge connecting Vertices u and v.



Find the maximum possible number of edges that can be added.

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq M \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq A_i,B_i \leq N
* The graph has no self-loops or multiple edges.
* The graph is connected.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M
A_1 B_1
A_2 B_2
:

Output

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
(N, M) = map(int, raw_input().split())
es = [[] for i in range(N)]
for i in range(M):
    (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    (a, b) = (a - 1, b - 1)
    es[a].append(b)
    es[b].append(a)
colors = [0 for i in range(N)]
if func_2():
    b = (sum(colors) + N) // 2
    w = N - b
    print(b * w - M)
else:
    all = N * (N - 1) // 2
    print(all - M)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: v is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the graph, color is an integer representing a color value, colors is a list of integers where each element corresponds to the color of a vertex (0 indicates uncolored), and es is a list of lists where each sublist contains the indices of vertices adjacent to the vertex at the same index in es.
def func_1(v, color):
    colors[v] = color
    for to in es[v]:
        if colors[to] == color:
            return False
        
        if colors[to] == 0 and not func_1(to, -color):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `v` is a non-negative integer, `color` is an integer, `colors[v]` is `color`, `es` is a list of lists, `es[v]` may contain any number of elements (including zero). For each `to` in `es[v]`, `colors[to]` is not equal to `color`. If `colors[to]` is 0, `func_1(to, -color)` must have returned `True` for the loop to complete without returning `False`.
    return True
    #The program returns True

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function func_2.
def func_2():
    return func_1(0, 1)
    #The program returns the result of calling `func_1` with arguments 0 and 1. The specific value returned depends on the implementation of `func_1`.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
