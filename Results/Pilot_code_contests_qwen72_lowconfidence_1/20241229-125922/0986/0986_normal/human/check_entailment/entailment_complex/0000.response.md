Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using an adjacency list (`es`), which is appropriate for handling up to \(10^5\) vertices and edges efficiently.

2. **Two-Coloring Check**: The function `func_1` attempts to color the graph using a two-coloring scheme. This is crucial because the problem requires adding edges between vertices that are exactly three edges apart. In a bipartite graph (which can be two-colored), vertices that are three edges apart are always in different color groups. If the graph can be two-colored, it means it is bipartite, and the maximum number of edges that can be added is determined by the product of the sizes of the two color groups minus the existing edges.

3. **Handling Non-Bipartite Graphs**: If the graph is not bipartite (i.e., `func_1` returns `False`), the code calculates the maximum number of edges that can be added by considering the total possible edges in a complete graph minus the existing edges. This is correct because in a non-bipartite graph, the maximum number of edges that can be added is the number of edges in a complete graph minus the current number of edges.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - If the graph is bipartite (`func_1` returns `True`), the code calculates the number of vertices in each color group (`b` and `w`) and computes the maximum number of edges that can be added as `b * w - M`.
   - If the graph is not bipartite (`func_1` returns `False`), the code calculates the maximum number of edges that can be added as `all - M`, where `all` is the total number of edges in a complete graph with `N` vertices.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the constraints and edge cases correctly. For example, it ensures that the graph is connected and that there are no self-loops or multiple edges.
   - The examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the code.

Given the above points, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and thus it is correct.
