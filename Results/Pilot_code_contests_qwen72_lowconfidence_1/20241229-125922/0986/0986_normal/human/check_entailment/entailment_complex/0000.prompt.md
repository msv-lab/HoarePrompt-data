You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Rng has a connected undirected graph with N vertices. Currently, there are M edges in the graph, and the i-th edge connects Vertices A_i and B_i.

Rng will add new edges to the graph by repeating the following operation:

* Operation: Choose u and v (u \neq v) such that Vertex v can be reached by traversing exactly three edges from Vertex u, and add an edge connecting Vertices u and v. It is not allowed to add an edge if there is already an edge connecting Vertices u and v.



Find the maximum possible number of edges that can be added.

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq M \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq A_i,B_i \leq N
* The graph has no self-loops or multiple edges.
* The graph is connected.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M
A_1 B_1
A_2 B_2
:
A_M B_M


Output

Find the maximum possible number of edges that can be added.

Annotated Functions:
(N, M) = map(int, raw_input().split())
es = [[] for i in range(N)]
for i in range(M):
    (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    (a, b) = (a - 1, b - 1)
    es[a].append(b)
    es[b].append(a)
colors = [0 for i in range(N)]
if func_2():
    b = (sum(colors) + N) // 2
    w = N - b
    print(b * w - M)
else:
    all = N * (N - 1) // 2
    print(all - M)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: v is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the graph, color is an integer representing a color value, colors is a list of integers where each element corresponds to the color of a vertex (0 indicates uncolored), and es is a list of lists where each sublist contains the indices of vertices adjacent to the vertex at the same index in es.
def func_1(v, color):
    colors[v] = color
    for to in es[v]:
        if colors[to] == color:
            return False
        
        if colors[to] == 0 and not func_1(to, -color):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `v` is a non-negative integer, `color` is an integer, `colors[v]` is `color`, `es` is a list of lists, `es[v]` may contain any number of elements (including zero). For each `to` in `es[v]`, `colors[to]` is not equal to `color`. If `colors[to]` is 0, `func_1(to, -color)` must have returned `True` for the loop to complete without returning `False`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` is designed to attempt to color a graph using a two-coloring scheme (i.e., using two different colors, typically represented by positive and negative values). The function takes two parameters: `v` (a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the graph) and `color` (an integer representing the color to be assigned to the vertex `v`). The function modifies the `colors` list, which stores the color of each vertex in the graph. The function returns `False` if it detects a conflict (i.e., an adjacent vertex already has the same color), indicating that the graph cannot be two-colored. If no conflicts are found and the coloring is successful, the function returns `True`.

### Summary of Function State After Execution:
-

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function func_2.
def func_2():
    return func_1(0, 1)
    #The program returns the result of calling `func_1` with arguments 0 and 1. The specific value returned depends on the implementation of `func_1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_1` with the arguments 0 and 1, and returns the result of this call. The specific value returned by `func_2` depends on the implementation of `func_1`. After the function concludes, the program will have the result of `func_1(0, 1)` available as the return value of `func_2`. There are no side effects or modifications to external variables or state within `func_2`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
