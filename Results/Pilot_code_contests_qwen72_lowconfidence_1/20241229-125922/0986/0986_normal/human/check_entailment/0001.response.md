Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program only includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which seem to be related to graph coloring (specifically, checking if the graph is bipartite). However, the problem requires finding the maximum number of edges that can be added by connecting vertices that are exactly three edges apart. The provided code does not implement this logic. Therefore, the program is incomplete and does not solve the problem as described. 

For example, consider the first test case:
```
Input:
6 5
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6

Expected Output:
4
```

The provided functions do not add any edges or compute the number of edges that can be added. They only check if the graph is bipartite, which is not relevant to the problem statement. Hence, the program is incorrect.
