Correctness: **True**.

### Explanation:
The program follows the problem description and works correctly for every potential case. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using adjacency lists (`es`), which efficiently store the connections between vertices.

2. **Coloring Function (`func_1`)**: This function attempts to color the graph using a two-coloring scheme. It ensures that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. If a conflict is detected, it returns `False`, indicating that the graph cannot be two-colored. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program first reads the input and constructs the graph.
   - It then calls `func_2()`, which in turn calls `func_1(0, 1)` to start the two-coloring process from vertex 0 with color 1.
   - If the graph can be two-colored (`func_2()` returns `True`), it calculates the maximum number of edges that can be added. This is done by counting the number of vertices of each color (`b` and `w`) and computing `b * w - M`, which gives the maximum number of edges that can be added without creating self-loops or multiple edges.
   - If the graph cannot be two-colored (`func_2()` returns `False`), it calculates the maximum number of edges that can be added in a fully connected graph and subtracts the existing edges (`all - M`).

4. **Edge Addition Calculation**:
   - For a two-colorable graph, the maximum number of edges that can be added is the product of the number of vertices of each color minus the existing edges.
   - For a non-two-colorable graph, the maximum number of edges that can be added is the total number of possible edges in a fully connected graph minus the existing edges.

The program correctly handles all constraints and edge cases, ensuring that it meets the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is correct.
