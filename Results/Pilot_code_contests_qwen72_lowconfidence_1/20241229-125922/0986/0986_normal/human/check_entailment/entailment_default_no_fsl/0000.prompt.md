You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Rng has a connected undirected graph with N vertices. Currently, there are M edges in the graph, and the i-th edge connects Vertices A_i and B_i.

Rng will add new edges to the graph by repeating the following operation:

* Operation: Choose u and v (u \neq v) such that Vertex v can be reached by traversing exactly three edges from Vertex u, and add an edge connecting Vertices u and v. It is not allowed to add an edge if there is already an edge connecting Vertices u and v.



Find the maximum possible number of edges that can be added.

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq M \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq A_i,B_i \leq N
* The graph has no self-loops or multiple edges.
* The graph is connected.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M
A_1 B_1
A_2 B_2
:
A_M B_M


Output

Find the maximum possible number of edges that can be added.

Functions with output description for each function:
(N, M) = map(int, raw_input().split())
es = [[] for i in range(N)]
for i in range(M):
    (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    (a, b) = (a - 1, b - 1)
    es[a].append(b)
    es[b].append(a)
colors = [0 for i in range(N)]
if func_2():
    b = (sum(colors) + N) // 2
    w = N - b
    print(b * w - M)
else:
    all = N * (N - 1) // 2
    print(all - M)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(v, color):
    colors[v] = color
    for to in es[v]:
        if colors[to] == color:
            return False
        if colors[to] == 0 and (not func_1(to, -color)):
            return False
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` is designed to attempt to color a graph using a two-coloring scheme (i.e., using two different colors, typically represented by positive and negative values). The function takes two parameters: `v` (a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the graph) and `color` (an integer representing the color to be assigned to the vertex `v`). The function modifies the `colors` list, which stores the color of each vertex in the graph. The function returns `False` if it detects a conflict (i.e., an adjacent vertex already has the same color), indicating that the graph cannot be two-colored. If no conflicts are found and the coloring is successful, the function returns `True`.

### Summary of Function State After Execution:
-
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return func_1(0, 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_1` with the arguments 0 and 1, and returns the result of this call. The specific value returned by `func_2` depends on the implementation of `func_1`. After the function concludes, the program will have the result of `func_1(0, 1)` available as the return value of `func_2`. There are no side effects or modifications to external variables or state within `func_2`.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
