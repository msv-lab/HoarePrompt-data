Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem of finding the maximum possible number of edges that can be added to a connected undirected graph by repeatedly adding edges between vertices that are exactly three edges apart.

1. **Graph Representation and Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of vertices `N` and edges `M`.
   - It then reads the edges and constructs an adjacency list `es` to represent the graph.

2. **Bipartite Check:**
   - The function `func_1` attempts to color the graph using a two-coloring scheme. This is done to check if the graph is bipartite.
   - If the graph is bipartite, it means that it can be divided into two sets of vertices such that no two vertices in the same set are adjacent. This property is crucial because in a bipartite graph, the maximum number of edges that can be added is determined by the product of the sizes of these two sets minus the existing edges.

3. **Edge Count Calculation:**
   - If the graph is bipartite (`func_2` returns `True`), the program calculates the sizes of the two sets (`b` and `w`) and computes the maximum number of edges that can be added as `b * w - M`.
   - If the graph is not bipartite (`func_2` returns `False`), the program calculates the total number of possible edges in a complete graph and subtracts the existing edges to get the maximum number of edges that can be added.

4. **Handling of Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints provided in the problem description, including the range of `N` and `M`, and the fact that the graph is connected and has no self-loops or multiple edges.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - The provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the program:
     - For the first example, the program correctly outputs `4`.
     - For the second example, the program correctly outputs `5`.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
