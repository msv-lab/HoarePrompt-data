The function `func_2` reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), splits the line into individual string tokens based on whitespace, converts each token to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function assumes that the input line contains valid integer representations separated by whitespace. If the input line is empty or contains non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`. After the function executes, the program will have a list of integers derived from the input, or it will terminate with an error if the input is invalid.
