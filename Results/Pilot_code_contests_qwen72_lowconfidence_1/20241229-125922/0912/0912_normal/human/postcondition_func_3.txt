The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of snow drifts. It then reads `n` pairs of coordinates `(x, y)` (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000) and stores them in a list `lst`. It also populates two dictionaries, `mydict_x` and `mydict_y`, which map x-coordinates to lists of y-coordinates and y-coordinates to lists of x-coordinates, respectively. The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to find the number of distinct connected components in the graph represented by these coordinates. Finally, it prints the number of connected components minus one. If `n` is 0, the function prints `-1` since there are no snow drifts to form any components.
