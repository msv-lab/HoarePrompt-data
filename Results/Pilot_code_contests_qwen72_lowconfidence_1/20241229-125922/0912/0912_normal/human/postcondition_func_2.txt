The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from standard input, removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the line, and returns the cleaned string. If the input is empty or consists only of whitespace, the function will return an empty string. The function does not handle any other edge cases, such as handling multi-line input or non-string inputs, and it assumes that the input is a single line of text. After the function concludes, the program state is unchanged except for the returned string, which is the result of the input processing.
