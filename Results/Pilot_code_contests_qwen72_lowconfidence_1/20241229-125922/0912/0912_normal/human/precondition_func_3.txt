No variables are passed as arguments to `func_4()`. Inside the function, `n` is an integer representing the number of snow drifts, with 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. `lst` is a list that will store tuples `(x, y)` representing the coordinates of each snow drift, where 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000. `mydict_x` and `mydict_y` are dictionaries mapping x-coordinates and y-coordinates to lists of corresponding y-coordinates and x-coordinates, respectively. `visited` is a set that will keep track of the snow drifts that have been visited during the depth-first search (DFS).
