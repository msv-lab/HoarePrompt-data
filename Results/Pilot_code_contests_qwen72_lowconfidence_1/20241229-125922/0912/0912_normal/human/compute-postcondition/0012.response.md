Output State: **`i` is a tuple of two integers representing the coordinates of a snow drift, `visited` is a set containing tuples of coordinates of snow drifts that have been visited, including all tuples `(i[0], child)` where `child` is in `mydict_x[i[0]]` and `(i[0], child)` was not originally in `visited`. `mydict_x` is a dictionary where keys are x-coordinates and values are sets of y-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same x-coordinate, and `mydict_x[i[0]]` contains all y-coordinates that were checked. `mydict_y` is a dictionary where keys are y-coordinates and values are sets of x-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same y-coordinate. If no unvisited `child` exists in `mydict_x[i[0]]`, the loop does not execute, and `visited` remains unchanged from its initial state.**
