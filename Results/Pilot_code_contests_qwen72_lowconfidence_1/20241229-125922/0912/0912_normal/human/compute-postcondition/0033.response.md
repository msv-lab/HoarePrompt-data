The value of `count_of_components` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `lst` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a tuple `(x, y)`, `mydict_x` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 1000 where each key `x` maps to a list containing `y` values corresponding to the tuples `(x, y)` in `lst`, `mydict_y` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 1000 where each key `y` maps to a list containing `x` values corresponding to the tuples `(x, y)` in `lst`, `visited` includes all elements reachable from the second element of `lst` and the third element of `lst` and any elements reachable from the third element of `lst`, `count_of_components` is incremented by 1, `i` is the third element of `lst`, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_1()` during the third iteration of the loop.**
