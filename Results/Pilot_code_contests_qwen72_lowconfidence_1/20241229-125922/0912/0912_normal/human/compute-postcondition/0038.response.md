Functionality: ** The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of snow drifts. It then reads `n` pairs of coordinates `(x, y)` (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000) and stores them in a list `lst`. It also populates two dictionaries, `mydict_x` and `mydict_y`, which map x-coordinates to lists of y-coordinates and y-coordinates to lists of x-coordinates, respectively. The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to find the number of distinct connected components in the graph represented by these coordinates. Finally, it prints the number of connected components minus one. If `n` is 0, the function prints `-1` since there are no snow drifts to form any components. **

### Detailed Summary:
- **Parameters:** None
- **Returns:** None
- **State After Execution:**
  - `n`: An integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), representing the number of snow drifts.
  - `lst`: A list containing `n` tuples `(x, y)`, where each tuple represents the coordinates of a snow drift.
  - `mydict_x`: A dictionary with keys from 1 to 1000, where each key `x` maps to a list of `y` values corresponding to the tuples `(x, y)` in `lst`.
  - `mydict_y`: A dictionary with keys from 1 to 1000, where each key `y` maps to a list of `x` values corresponding to the tuples `(x, y)` in `lst`.
  - `visited`: A set containing all elements in `lst` and all elements reachable from any element in `lst` through the tuples in `lst`.
  - `count_of_components`: The number of distinct connected components in the graph represented by `lst`.
  - The function prints `count_of_components - 1`.

### Edge Cases:
- **If `n` is 0:**
  - `lst`, `mydict_x`, and `mydict_y` remain unchanged.
  - `visited` remains an empty set.
  - `count_of_components` remains 0.
  - The function prints `-1`.

### Missing Functionality:
- The function assumes that the `dfs` function is defined elsewhere and correctly implements a depth-first search. If `dfs` is not implemented or does not work as expected, the function will not correctly determine the number of connected components.
- The function does not handle cases where the input coordinates are out of the specified range (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000). This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
