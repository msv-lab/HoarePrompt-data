Postcondition: ***`i` is a tuple of two integers representing the coordinates of a snow drift, `visited` is a set containing tuples of coordinates of snow drifts that have been visited, including `i`. `mydict_x` is a dictionary where keys are x-coordinates and values are sets of y-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same x-coordinate, and `mydict_x[i[0]]` must contain at least one y-coordinate that is not in `visited`. `mydict_y` is a dictionary where keys are y-coordinates and values are sets of x-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same y-coordinate. `child` is the next y-coordinate in `mydict_x[i[0]]` that has not been visited. If `(i[0], child)` is not in `visited`, `dfs((i[0], child))` has been called.***
