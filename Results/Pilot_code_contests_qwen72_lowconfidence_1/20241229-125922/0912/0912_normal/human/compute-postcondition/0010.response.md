The function `dfs((i[0], child))` is called with the argument `(i[0], child)`, which represents the coordinates of a snow drift to be visited next.

- `i` remains a tuple of two integers representing the coordinates of a snow drift.
- `visited` is a set containing tuples of coordinates of snow drifts that have been visited, including `i`.
- `mydict_x` is a dictionary where keys are x-coordinates and values are sets of y-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same x-coordinate.
- `mydict_y` is a dictionary where keys are y-coordinates and values are sets of x-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same y-coordinate.
- `child` is the next y-coordinate in `mydict_x[i[0]]` that has not been visited.

The call to `dfs((i[0], child))` does not change the values of `i`, `visited`, `mydict_x`, `mydict_y`, or `child` directly. However, it initiates a recursive or deeper exploration starting from the new coordinates `(i[0], child)`.

Output State: **`i` is a tuple of two integers representing the coordinates of a snow drift, `visited` is a set containing tuples of coordinates of snow drifts that have been visited, including `i`, `mydict_x` is a dictionary where keys are x-coordinates and values are sets of y-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same x-coordinate, `mydict_y` is a dictionary where keys are y-coordinates and values are sets of x-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same y-coordinate, `child` is the next y-coordinate in `mydict_x[i[0]]` that has not been visited, `dfs((i[0], child))` has been called.**
