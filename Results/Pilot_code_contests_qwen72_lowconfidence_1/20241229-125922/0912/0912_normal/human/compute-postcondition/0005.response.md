Postcondition: ***`i` is a tuple of two integers representing the coordinates of a snow drift, `visited` is a set containing tuples of coordinates of snow drifts that have been visited including `i`, `mydict_x` is a dictionary where keys are x-coordinates and values are sets of y-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same x-coordinate, `mydict_x[i[0]]` must contain at least one y-coordinate, `mydict_y` is a dictionary where keys are y-coordinates and values are sets of x-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same y-coordinate. If `(i[0], child)` is not in `visited`, the `dfs` function has been called with the argument `(i[0], child)`.***
