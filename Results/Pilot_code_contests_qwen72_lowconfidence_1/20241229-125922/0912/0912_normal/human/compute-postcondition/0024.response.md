Postcondition: ***`i` is a tuple of two integers representing the coordinates of a snow drift, and `visited` is a set containing tuples of coordinates of snow drifts that have been visited. If `i` is not in `visited`, then after all iterations of the loop, `visited` includes all tuples `(child, i[1])` where `child` is in `mydict_y[i[1]]` and `(child, i[1])` was not originally in `visited`. If no unvisited `child` exists in `mydict_y[i[1]]`, the loop does not execute, and `visited` remains unchanged from its initial state. If `i` is already in `visited`, `visited` remains unchanged.***
