To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `i` is a tuple of two integers representing the coordinates of a snow drift.
- `visited` is a set containing tuples of coordinates of snow drifts that have been visited, including `i`.
- `mydict_x` is a dictionary where keys are x-coordinates and values are sets of y-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same x-coordinate.
- `mydict_y` is a dictionary where keys are y-coordinates and values are sets of x-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same y-coordinate.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for child in mydict_x[i[0]]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `mydict_x[i[0]]` contains at least one element (y-coordinate).
2. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is a tuple of two integers.
   - `visited` includes `i`.
   - `mydict_x` and `mydict_y` are dictionaries as described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Check `mydict_x[i[0]]`**:
   - The loop will only execute if `mydict_x[i[0]]` is not an empty set.
   - Therefore, `mydict_x[i[0]]` must contain at least one y-coordinate.

2. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Ensure that `mydict_x[i[0]]` is not empty. This means there must be at least one y-coordinate associated with the x-coordinate `i[0]`.

3. **Other States**:
   - `i` is already defined and is a tuple of two integers.
   - `visited` already includes `i`.
   - `mydict_y` is not directly relevant to the loop condition, but it should still be present as part of the initial state.

### Final State:
To ensure the loop executes, `mydict_x[i[0]]` must contain at least one y-coordinate. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect this requirement.

State: **`i` is a tuple of two integers representing the coordinates of a snow drift, `visited` is a set containing tuples of coordinates of snow drifts that have been visited including `i`, `mydict_x` is a dictionary where keys are x-coordinates and values are sets of y-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same x-coordinate, `mydict_x[i[0]]` must contain at least one y-coordinate, `mydict_y` is a dictionary where keys are y-coordinates and values are sets of x-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same y-coordinate.**
