To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `lst` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a tuple `(x, y)`.
- `mydict_x` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 1000 where each key `x` maps to a list containing `y` values corresponding to the tuples `(x, y)` in `lst`.
- `mydict_y` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 1000 where each key `y` maps to a list containing `x` values corresponding to the tuples `(x, y)` in `lst`.
- `visited` includes `i` and possibly other elements connected to `i` through the tuples in `lst` if `i` is not in `visited`.
- `count_of_components` is incremented by 1 if `i` is not in `visited`.
- `i` is the first element of `lst`.
- `x` and `y` are the last values returned by `func_1()` during the final iteration of the loop.
- If `n` is 0, then `lst`, `mydict_x`, and `mydict_y` remain unchanged and `i` is -1.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in lst:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `lst` to iterate over.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the first element of `lst`. This means the loop has just processed the first element of `lst`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `lst` must be available. Since `i` is the first element, the next element will be the second element of `lst`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` should now be the second element of `lst`.
- The `visited` set should include the first element of `lst` (if it was not already included).
- The `count_of_components` should be incremented by 1 if the first element of `lst` was not in `visited` before this iteration.
- The `x` and `y` values should be updated to the values returned by `func_1()` during the current iteration (which is the second iteration).

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `lst` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a tuple `(x, y)`, `mydict_x` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 1000 where each key `x` maps to a list containing `y` values corresponding to the tuples `(x, y)` in `lst`, `mydict_y` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 1000 where each key `y` maps to a list containing `x` values corresponding to the tuples `(x, y)` in `lst`, `visited` includes the first element of `lst` and possibly other elements connected to the first element through the tuples in `lst`, `count_of_components` is incremented by 1 if the first element of `lst` was not in `visited`, `i` is the second element of `lst`, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_1()` during the second iteration of the loop.**
