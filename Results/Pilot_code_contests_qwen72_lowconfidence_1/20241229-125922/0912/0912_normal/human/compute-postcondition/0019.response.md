Postcondition: ***`i` is a tuple of two integers representing the coordinates of a snow drift, `visited` is a set containing tuples of coordinates of snow drifts that have been visited including the tuple `(child, i[1])` from the previous iteration, `mydict_x` is a dictionary where keys are x-coordinates and values are sets of y-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same x-coordinate, `mydict_y` is a dictionary where keys are y-coordinates and values are sets of x-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same y-coordinate, and `mydict_y[i[1]]` contains at least one element and at least one `child` in `mydict_y[i[1]]` that is not in `visited`. If `(child, i[1])` is not in `visited`, the `dfs` function has been called with the argument `(child, i[1])`. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
