Postcondition: ***`i` is a tuple of two integers representing the coordinates of a snow drift, `visited` is a set containing tuples of coordinates of snow drifts that have been visited, `mydict_x` is a dictionary where keys are x-coordinates and values are sets of y-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same x-coordinate, `mydict_y` is a dictionary where keys are y-coordinates and values are sets of x-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same y-coordinate, `mydict_y[i[1]]` contains at least one element, and there is at least one `child` in `mydict_y[i[1]]` that is not in `visited`. The current value of `child` is such that the tuple `(child, i[1])` is not in `visited`.***
