Postcondition: **`i` is a tuple of two integers representing the coordinates of a snow drift, and `visited` is a set containing tuples of coordinates of snow drifts that have been visited. `mydict_x` is a dictionary where keys are x-coordinates and values are sets of y-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same x-coordinate. `mydict_y` is a dictionary where keys are y-coordinates and values are sets of x-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same y-coordinate. The current value of `i` is not in the set `visited`.**
