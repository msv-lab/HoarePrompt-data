Output State: **`i` is a tuple of two integers representing the coordinates of a snow drift, `visited` is a set containing tuples of coordinates of snow drifts that have been visited. After all iterations of the loop, `visited` includes all tuples `(child, i[1])` where `child` is in `mydict_y[i[1]]` and `(child, i[1])` was not originally in `visited`. `mydict_x` is a dictionary where keys are x-coordinates and values are sets of y-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same x-coordinate, and `mydict_y` is a dictionary where keys are y-coordinates and values are sets of x-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same y-coordinate. If no unvisited `child` exists in `mydict_y[i[1]]`, the loop does not execute, and `visited` remains unchanged from its initial state.**
