The code snippet prints the value of `count_of_components - 1`. This operation does not modify any of the variables in the initial state, but it does produce output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `lst` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a tuple `(x, y)`, `mydict_x` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 1000 where each key `x` maps to a list containing `y` values corresponding to the tuples `(x, y)` in `lst`, `mydict_y` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 1000 where each key `y` maps to a list containing `x` values corresponding to the tuples `(x, y)` in `lst`, `visited` includes all elements in `lst` and all elements reachable from any element in `lst` through the tuples in `lst`, `count_of_components` is the number of distinct connected components in the graph represented by `lst`, `i` is the last element of `lst`, `x` and `y` are the last values returned by `func_1()` during the final iteration of the loop. If `n` is 0, then `lst`, `mydict_x`, and `mydict_y` remain unchanged, `visited` remains an empty set, `count_of_components` remains 0, and `i` is -1.** 

The value of `count_of_components - 1` has been printed.
