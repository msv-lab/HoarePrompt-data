The function `dfs(i)` is called, which presumably performs a depth-first search starting from the node represented by `i`. Given the initial state, the call to `dfs(i)` will affect the `visited` set and potentially the `count_of_components` variable. Here's the detailed reasoning:

- `i` is the third element of `lst`, so `i` is a tuple `(x, y)`.
- The `dfs` function will explore all nodes connected to `i` and mark them as visited in the `visited` set.
- If `i` (the third element of `lst`) was not already in `visited`, `count_of_components` will be incremented by 1.

Let's break down the impact on the variables:

1. **`visited`**: This set will be updated to include all elements reachable from `i` that were not already in `visited`.
2. **`count_of_components`**: If `i` was not already in `visited`, this variable will be incremented by 1.

Other variables (`n`, `lst`, `mydict_x`, `mydict_y`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged unless they are modified within the `dfs` function, but based on the given initial state, no such modifications are specified.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `lst` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a tuple `(x, y)`, `mydict_x` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 1000 where each key `x` maps to a list containing `y` values corresponding to the tuples `(x, y)` in `lst`, `mydict_y` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 1000 where each key `y` maps to a list containing `x` values corresponding to the tuples `(x, y)` in `lst`, `visited` includes all elements reachable from the second element of `lst` and the third element of `lst` and any elements reachable from the third element of `lst`, `count_of_components` is incremented by 1 if the third element of `lst` was not already in `visited`, `i` is the third element of `lst`, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_1()` during the third iteration of the loop.**
