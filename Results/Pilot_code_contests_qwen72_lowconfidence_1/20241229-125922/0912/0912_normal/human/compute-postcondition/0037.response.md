The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. Inside the function, it utilizes an integer `n` representing the number of snow drifts, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. It also uses a list `lst` to store tuples `(x, y)` representing the coordinates of each snow drift, where 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000. Additionally, it uses two dictionaries, `mydict_x` and `mydict_y`, which map x-coordinates and y-coordinates to lists of corresponding y-coordinates and x-coordinates, respectively. A set `visited` is used to keep track of the snow drifts that have been visited during the depth-first search (DFS).

Since the output description is not provided, I cannot determine the exact return value of the function. However, based on the context, it seems the function likely performs some operations involving the coordinates and the DFS, but without more specific information about the output, I can only describe the parameters and the internal structures used.

Functionality: **The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It operates using an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of snow drifts, a list `lst` storing tuples `(x, y)` (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000) for the coordinates of each snow drift, dictionaries `mydict_x` and `mydict_y` mapping x-coordinates and y-coordinates to lists of corresponding y-coordinates and x-coordinates, respectively, and a set `visited` to track visited snow drifts during a depth-first search (DFS).**
