The code increments the value of `count_of_components` by 1. This means the previous value of `count_of_components` is increased by 1. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `lst` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a tuple `(x, y)`, `mydict_x` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 1000 where each key `x` maps to a list containing `y` values corresponding to the tuples `(x, y)` in `lst`, `mydict_y` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 1000 where each key `y` maps to a list containing `x` values corresponding to the tuples `(x, y)` in `lst`, `visited` includes all elements reachable from the second element of `lst` and possibly other elements connected to the first element through the tuples in `lst`, `count_of_components` is incremented by 1, `i` is the second element of `lst`, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_1()` during the second iteration of the loop.**
