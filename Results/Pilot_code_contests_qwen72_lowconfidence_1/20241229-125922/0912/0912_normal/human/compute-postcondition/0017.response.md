To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Current State:**
   - `i` is a tuple of two integers representing the coordinates of a snow drift.
   - `visited` is a set containing tuples of coordinates of snow drifts that have been visited.
   - `mydict_x` is a dictionary where keys are x-coordinates and values are sets of y-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same x-coordinate.
   - `mydict_y` is a dictionary where keys are y-coordinates and values are sets of x-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same y-coordinate.
   - If `(child, i[1])` is not in `visited`, then `visited` includes the tuple `(child, i[1])`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each `child` in `mydict_y[i[1]]`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one `child` in `mydict_y[i[1]]` that is not in `visited`.

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - **`i`**: The value of `i` does not change during the iteration of the loop.
   - **`visited`**: The set `visited` may include new elements if `(child, i[1])` is not already in `visited`. After the previous iteration, a new tuple `(child, i[1])` was added to `visited`.
   - **`mydict_x` and `mydict_y`**: These dictionaries remain unchanged.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, there must still be at least one `child` in `mydict_y[i[1]]` that is not in `visited`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the following adjustments:

- `visited` now includes the tuple `(child, i[1])` from the previous iteration.
- There must be at least one `child` in `mydict_y[i[1]]` that is not in `visited`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is a tuple of two integers representing the coordinates of a snow drift, `visited` is a set containing tuples of coordinates of snow drifts that have been visited including the tuple `(child, i[1])` from the previous iteration, `mydict_x` is a dictionary where keys are x-coordinates and values are sets of y-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same x-coordinate, `mydict_y` is a dictionary where keys are y-coordinates and values are sets of x-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same y-coordinate, and `mydict_y[i[1]]` contains at least one element and at least one `child` in `mydict_y[i[1]]` that is not in `visited`.**
