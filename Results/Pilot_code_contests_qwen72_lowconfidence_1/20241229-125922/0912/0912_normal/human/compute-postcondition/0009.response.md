To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Current State**:
   - `i` is a tuple of two integers representing the coordinates of a snow drift.
   - `visited` is a set containing tuples of coordinates of snow drifts that have been visited, including `i`.
   - `mydict_x` is a dictionary where keys are x-coordinates and values are sets of y-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same x-coordinate.
   - `mydict_x[i[0]]` must contain at least one y-coordinate.
   - `mydict_y` is a dictionary where keys are y-coordinates and values are sets of x-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same y-coordinate.

2. **For Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for child in mydict_x[i[0]]:
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `mydict_x[i[0]]` that have not yet been processed.
   - The variable `child` takes on each value from the set `mydict_x[i[0]]`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `i` is the current snow drift being processed, and `child` iterates over the y-coordinates in `mydict_x[i[0]]`, the next iteration will use the next `child` value from the set.
   - The set `mydict_x[i[0]]` should still contain at least one unvisited `child` for the loop to execute again.
   - The `visited` set should not already contain the tuple `(i[0], child)` for the next `child` to be processed.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect the next `child` value in `mydict_x[i[0]]` and ensure that it is not already in `visited`.

**Adjusted State**:
- `i` remains the same as it represents the current x-coordinate.
- `child` is the next y-coordinate in `mydict_x[i[0]]` that has not been visited.
- `visited` must not contain the tuple `(i[0], child)` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is a tuple of two integers representing the coordinates of a snow drift, `visited` is a set containing tuples of coordinates of snow drifts that have been visited, including `i`. `mydict_x` is a dictionary where keys are x-coordinates and values are sets of y-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same x-coordinate, and `mydict_x[i[0]]` must contain at least one y-coordinate that is not in `visited`. `mydict_y` is a dictionary where keys are y-coordinates and values are sets of x-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same y-coordinate. `child` is the next y-coordinate in `mydict_x[i[0]]` that has not been visited.**
