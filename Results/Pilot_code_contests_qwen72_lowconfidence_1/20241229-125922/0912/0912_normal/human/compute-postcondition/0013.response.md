To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions based on the provided information:

1. **`child` in `mydict_y[i[1]]`**: The loop will iterate over each `child` in the set `mydict_y[i[1]]`. For the loop to execute at least once, `mydict_y[i[1]]` must contain at least one element.

2. **Unvisited `child`**: The problem statement mentions that if no unvisited `child` exists in `mydict_x[i[0]]`, the loop does not execute. This implies that for the loop to execute, there must be at least one `child` in `mydict_y[i[1]]` that is not in `visited`.

3. **Initial State of `visited`**: The `visited` set initially contains tuples `(i[0], child)` where `child` is in `mydict_x[i[0]]` and `(i[0], child)` was not originally in `visited`. This means that some elements in `mydict_x[i[0]]` might already be in `visited`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that:

- `mydict_y[i[1]]` is not empty.
- There is at least one `child` in `mydict_y[i[1]]` that is not in `visited`.

Let's summarize the required adjustments:

- **`mydict_y[i[1]]` must contain at least one element**.
- **There must be at least one `child` in `mydict_y[i[1]]` that is not in `visited`**.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is a tuple of two integers representing the coordinates of a snow drift, `visited` is a set containing tuples of coordinates of snow drifts that have been visited, `mydict_x` is a dictionary where keys are x-coordinates and values are sets of y-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same x-coordinate, `mydict_y` is a dictionary where keys are y-coordinates and values are sets of x-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same y-coordinate, `mydict_y[i[1]]` must contain at least one element, and there must be at least one `child` in `mydict_y[i[1]]` that is not in `visited`**.
