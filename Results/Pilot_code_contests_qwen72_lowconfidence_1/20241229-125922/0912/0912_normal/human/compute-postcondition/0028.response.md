The function `dfs(i)` is called, which implies a depth-first search starting from the second element of `lst`. Since the specifics of the `dfs` function are not provided, we can infer the following based on typical behavior of a DFS algorithm in this context:

- The `visited` set will include all elements that are reachable from `i` (the second element of `lst`), including `i` itself.
- If `i` was not already in `visited` before the call, `count_of_components` would be incremented by 1. However, since `i` is the second element and the first element is already in `visited`, whether `count_of_components` is incremented depends on whether `i` was previously visited or not. Given that `i` is the second element and typically the first element would be connected to the second, it's likely `i` was not previously visited.

Therefore, the `visited` set will be updated to include all elements reachable from `i`, and `count_of_components` will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `lst` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a tuple `(x, y)`, `mydict_x` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 1000 where each key `x` maps to a list containing `y` values corresponding to the tuples `(x, y)` in `lst`, `mydict_y` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 1000 where each key `y` maps to a list containing `x` values corresponding to the tuples `(x, y)` in `lst`, `visited` includes all elements reachable from the second element of `lst` and possibly other elements connected to the first element through the tuples in `lst`, `count_of_components` is incremented by 1 if the second element of `lst` was not in `visited`, `i` is the second element of `lst`, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_1()` during the second iteration of the loop.**
