You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bajtek is learning to skate on ice. He's a beginner, so his only mode of transportation is pushing off from a snow drift to the north, east, south or west and sliding until he lands in another snow drift. He has noticed that in this way it's impossible to get from some snow drifts to some other by any sequence of moves. He now wants to heap up some additional snow drifts, so that he can get from any snow drift to any other one. He asked you to find the minimal number of snow drifts that need to be created.

We assume that Bajtek can only heap up snow drifts at integer coordinates.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of snow drifts. Each of the following n lines contains two integers xi and yi (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000) — the coordinates of the i-th snow drift.

Note that the north direction coinсides with the direction of Oy axis, so the east direction coinсides with the direction of the Ox axis. All snow drift's locations are distinct.

Output

Output the minimal number of snow drifts that need to be created in order for Bajtek to be able to reach any snow drift from any other one.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` reads a single line from standard input, removes any leading and trailing whitespace, splits the line into parts based on spaces, and converts each part into an integer. It returns a map object containing these integers. The actual content of the map object depends on the input provided. If the input line contains non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`. If the input line is empty or contains only whitespace, the function will return an empty map object.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), splits the line into individual string tokens based on whitespace, converts each token to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function assumes that the input line contains valid integer representations separated by whitespace. If the input line is empty or contains non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`. After the function executes, the program will have a list of integers derived from the input, or it will terminate with an error if the input is invalid.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from standard input, removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the line, and returns the cleaned string. If the input is empty or consists only of whitespace, the function will return an empty string. The function does not handle any other edge cases, such as handling multi-line input or non-string inputs, and it assumes that the input is a single line of text. After the function concludes, the program state is unchanged except for the returned string, which is the result of the input processing.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():

    n = int(func_3())
    lst = []
    count_of_components = 0
    mydict_x = {i: [] for i in range(1, 1001)}
    mydict_y = {i: [] for i in range(1, 1001)}
    for i in range(n):
        (x, y) = func_1()
        lst.append((x, y))
        mydict_x[x].append(y)
        mydict_y[y].append(x)
    visited = set()
    for i in lst:
        if i not in visited:
            dfs(i)
            count_of_components += 1
    print(count_of_components - 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of snow drifts. It then reads `n` pairs of coordinates `(x, y)` (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000) and stores them in a list `lst`. It also populates two dictionaries, `mydict_x` and `mydict_y`, which map x-coordinates to lists of y-coordinates and y-coordinates to lists of x-coordinates, respectively. The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to find the number of distinct connected components in the graph represented by these coordinates. Finally, it prints the number of connected components minus one. If `n` is 0, the function prints `-1` since there are no snow drifts to form any components.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def dfs(i):
    if i not in visited:
        visited.add(i)
        for child in mydict_x[i[0]]:
            if (i[0], child) not in visited:
                dfs((i[0], child))
        for child in mydict_y[i[1]]:
            if (child, i[1]) not in visited:
                dfs((child, i[1]))
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the given snow drift coordinates `i`. It marks the current snow drift as visited by adding `i` to the `visited` set. Then, it recursively explores all connected snow drifts that share the same x-coordinate and y-coordinate, marking them as visited if they haven't been visited yet. The function modifies the `visited` set to include all reachable snow drifts from the starting point `i`. If `i` is already in `visited`, the function does nothing. The dictionaries `mydict_x` and `mydict_y` are used to efficiently find connected snow drifts. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `visited` contains all the snow drifts that are reachable from the starting point `i`, and `i` itself is marked as visited.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
