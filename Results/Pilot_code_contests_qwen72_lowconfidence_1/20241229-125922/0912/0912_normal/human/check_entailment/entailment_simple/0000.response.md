Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly solves the problem described. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of snow drifts (`n`) and their coordinates using the `func_3` and `func_1` functions. This matches the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Data Structures:**
   - The program uses a list `lst` to store the coordinates of the snow drifts.
   - Two dictionaries `mydict_x` and `mydict_y` are used to map x-coordinates to y-coordinates and y-coordinates to x-coordinates, respectively. This helps in efficiently finding all snow drifts that share the same x or y coordinate.

3. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - The program uses a DFS algorithm to explore all connected components of the graph formed by the snow drifts. The graph is implicitly defined by the shared x and y coordinates.
   - The `dfs` function marks visited snow drifts and recursively visits all connected snow drifts.

4. **Counting Components:**
   - The program counts the number of connected components using the `count_of_components` variable. Each time a new unvisited snow drift is found, a new component is counted.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints `count_of_components - 1`, which is the minimum number of additional snow drifts needed to ensure connectivity between all snow drifts. This is because adding one snow drift can connect two previously disconnected components.

### Why It Meets the Problem Description:

- **Input Handling:** The program correctly reads the input in the specified format.
- **Graph Representation:** The use of dictionaries `mydict_x` and `mydict_y` allows efficient lookup of connected snow drifts.
- **DFS Algorithm:** The DFS algorithm ensures that all connected components are correctly identified.
- **Output Calculation:** The output is calculated as `count_of_components - 1`, which is the minimal number of additional snow drifts required to connect all components.

### Potential Edge Cases:

- **Single Snow Drift:** If there is only one snow drift, the program correctly outputs `0` because no additional snow drifts are needed.
- **Multiple Isolated Snow Drifts:** If there are multiple isolated snow drifts, the program correctly counts each as a separate component and outputs the number of additional snow drifts needed to connect them.
- **Fully Connected Snow Drifts:** If all snow drifts are already connected, the program correctly outputs `0`.

Given these points, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
