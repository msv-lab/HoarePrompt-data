Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the coordinates are not unique. According to the problem description, all snow drift's locations are distinct. However, the code does not enforce this constraint, and it could potentially lead to incorrect results if the input contains duplicate coordinates.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the input is empty (i.e., `n = 0`). The problem description specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, but the program will print `-1` if `n` is 0, which is not a valid output according to the problem description.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  0
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  0
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  -1
  ```

This discrepancy means the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
