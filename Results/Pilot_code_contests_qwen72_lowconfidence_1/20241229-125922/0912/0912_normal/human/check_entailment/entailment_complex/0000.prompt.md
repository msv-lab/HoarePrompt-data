You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bajtek is learning to skate on ice. He's a beginner, so his only mode of transportation is pushing off from a snow drift to the north, east, south or west and sliding until he lands in another snow drift. He has noticed that in this way it's impossible to get from some snow drifts to some other by any sequence of moves. He now wants to heap up some additional snow drifts, so that he can get from any snow drift to any other one. He asked you to find the minimal number of snow drifts that need to be created.

We assume that Bajtek can only heap up snow drifts at integer coordinates.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of snow drifts. Each of the following n lines contains two integers xi and yi (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000) — the coordinates of the i-th snow drift.

Note that the north direction coinсides with the direction of Oy axis, so the east direction coinсides with the direction of the Ox axis. All snow drift's locations are distinct.

Output

Output the minimal number of snow drifts that need to be created in order for Bajtek to be able to reach any snow drift from any other one.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are passed as parameters to the function `func_1`. This function reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line into parts, and maps each part to an integer.
def func_1():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts each part of the input line (after stripping leading/trailing whitespace and splitting by spaces) into an integer. The actual content depends on the input provided to the standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a single line from standard input, removes any leading and trailing whitespace, splits the line into parts based on spaces, and converts each part into an integer. It returns a map object containing these integers. The actual content of the map object depends on the input provided. If the input line contains non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`. If the input line is empty or contains only whitespace, the function will return an empty map object.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function reads input from standard input and returns a list of integers.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers read from standard input, where each integer is converted from its string representation.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), splits the line into individual string tokens based on whitespace, converts each token to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function assumes that the input line contains valid integer representations separated by whitespace. If the input line is empty or contains non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`. After the function executes, the program will have a list of integers derived from the input, or it will terminate with an error if the input is invalid.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters. It reads a line from standard input, strips leading and trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a string read from standard input with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from standard input, removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the line, and returns the cleaned string. If the input is empty or consists only of whitespace, the function will return an empty string. The function does not handle any other edge cases, such as handling multi-line input or non-string inputs, and it assumes that the input is a single line of text. After the function concludes, the program state is unchanged except for the returned string, which is the result of the input processing.

If `n` is 0, then `lst`, `mydict_x`, and `mydict_y` remain unchanged, `visited` remains an empty set, `count_of_components` remains 0, and `i` is -1.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of snow drifts. It then reads `n` pairs of coordinates `(x, y)` (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000) and stores them in a list `lst`. It also populates two dictionaries, `mydict_x` and `mydict_y`, which map x-coordinates to lists of y-coordinates and y-coordinates to lists of x-coordinates, respectively. The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to find the number of distinct connected components in the graph represented by these coordinates. Finally, it prints the number of connected components minus one. If `n` is 0, the function prints `-1` since there are no snow drifts to form any components.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a tuple of two integers representing the coordinates of a snow drift, and `visited` is a set containing tuples of coordinates of snow drifts that have been visited. `mydict_x` is a dictionary where keys are x-coordinates and values are sets of y-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same x-coordinate. `mydict_y` is a dictionary where keys are y-coordinates and values are sets of x-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same y-coordinate.

    if (i not in visited) :
        visited.add(i)
        for child in mydict_x[i[0]]:
            if (i[0], child) not in visited:
                dfs((i[0], child))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is a tuple of two integers representing the coordinates of a snow drift, `visited` is a set containing tuples of coordinates of snow drifts that have been visited, including all tuples `(i[0], child)` where `child` is in `mydict_x[i[0]]` and `(i[0], child)` was not originally in `visited`. `mydict_x` is a dictionary where keys are x-coordinates and values are sets of y-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same x-coordinate, and `mydict_x[i[0]]` contains all y-coordinates that were checked. `mydict_y` is a dictionary where keys are y-coordinates and values are sets of x-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same y-coordinate. If no unvisited `child` exists in `mydict_x[i[0]]`, the loop does not execute, and `visited` remains unchanged from its initial state.
        for child in mydict_y[i[1]]:
            if (child, i[1]) not in visited:
                dfs((child, i[1]))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is a tuple of two integers representing the coordinates of a snow drift, `visited` is a set containing tuples of coordinates of snow drifts that have been visited. After all iterations of the loop, `visited` includes all tuples `(child, i[1])` where `child` is in `mydict_y[i[1]]` and `(child, i[1])` was not originally in `visited`. `mydict_x` is a dictionary where keys are x-coordinates and values are sets of y-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same x-coordinate, and `mydict_y` is a dictionary where keys are y-coordinates and values are sets of x-coordinates of snow drifts sharing the same y-coordinate. If no unvisited `child` exists in `mydict_y[i[1]]`, the loop does not execute, and `visited` remains unchanged from its initial state.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`i` is a tuple of two integers representing the coordinates of a snow drift, and `visited` is a set containing tuples of coordinates of snow drifts that have been visited. If `i` is not in `visited`, then after all iterations of the loop, `visited` includes all tuples `(child, i[1])` where `child` is in `mydict_y[i[1]]` and `(child, i[1])` was not originally in `visited`. If no unvisited `child` exists in `mydict_y[i[1]]`, the loop does not execute, and `visited` remains unchanged from its initial state. If `i` is already in `visited`, `visited` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the given snow drift coordinates `i`. It marks the current snow drift as visited by adding `i` to the `visited` set. Then, it recursively explores all connected snow drifts that share the same x-coordinate and y-coordinate, marking them as visited if they haven't been visited yet. The function modifies the `visited` set to include all reachable snow drifts from the starting point `i`. If `i` is already in `visited`, the function does nothing. The dictionaries `mydict_x` and `mydict_y` are used to efficiently find connected snow drifts. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `visited` contains all the snow drifts that are reachable from the starting point `i`, and `i` itself is marked as visited.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
