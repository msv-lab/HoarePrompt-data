You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bajtek is learning to skate on ice. He's a beginner, so his only mode of transportation is pushing off from a snow drift to the north, east, south or west and sliding until he lands in another snow drift. He has noticed that in this way it's impossible to get from some snow drifts to some other by any sequence of moves. He now wants to heap up some additional snow drifts, so that he can get from any snow drift to any other one. He asked you to find the minimal number of snow drifts that need to be created.

We assume that Bajtek can only heap up snow drifts at integer coordinates.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of snow drifts. Each of the following n lines contains two integers xi and yi (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000) — the coordinates of the i-th snow drift.

Note that the north direction coinсides with the direction of Oy axis, so the east direction coinсides with the direction of the Ox axis. All snow drift's locations are distinct.

Output

Output the minimal number of snow drifts that need to be created in order for Bajtek to be able to reach any snow drift from any other one.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` reads a single line from standard input, removes any leading and trailing whitespace, splits the line into parts based on spaces, and converts each part into an integer. It returns a map object containing these integers. The actual content of the map object depends on the input provided. If the input line contains non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`. If the input line is empty or contains only whitespace, the function will return an empty map object.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), splits the line into individual string tokens based on whitespace, converts each token to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function assumes that the input line contains valid integer representations separated by whitespace. If the input line is empty or contains non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`. After the function executes, the program will have a list of integers derived from the input, or it will terminate with an error if the input is invalid.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from standard input, removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the line, and returns the cleaned string. If the input is empty or consists only of whitespace, the function will return an empty string. The function does not handle any other edge cases, such as handling multi-line input or non-string inputs, and it assumes that the input is a single line of text. After the function concludes, the program state is unchanged except for the returned string, which is the result of the input processing.
Function number 4 :
 Code:

def func_4():

    lst = []
    count_of_components = 0

            dfs(i)
            count_of_components += 1
    print(count_of_components - 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of snow drifts. It then reads `n` pairs of coordinates `(x, y)` (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000) and stores them in a list `lst`. It also populates two dictionaries, `mydict_x` and `mydict_y`, which map x-coordinates to lists of y-coordinates and y-coordinates to lists of x-coordinates, respectively. The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to find the number of distinct connected components in the graph represented by these coordinates. Finally, it prints the number of connected components minus one. If `n` is 0, the function prints `-1` since there are no snow drifts to form any components.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def dfs(i):
    if i not in visited:
        visited.add(i)
        for child in mydict_x[i[0]]:
            if (i[0], child) not in visited:
                dfs((i[0], child))
        for child in mydict_y[i[1]]:
            if (child, i[1]) not in visited:
                dfs((child, i[1]))
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the given snow drift coordinates `i`. It marks the current snow drift as visited by adding `i` to the `visited` set. Then, it recursively explores all connected snow drifts that share the same x-coordinate and y-coordinate, marking them as visited if they haven't been visited yet. The function modifies the `visited` set to include all reachable snow drifts from the starting point `i`. If `i` is already in `visited`, the function does nothing. The dictionaries `mydict_x` and `mydict_y` are used to efficiently find connected snow drifts. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `visited` contains all the snow drifts that are reachable from the starting point `i`, and `i` itself is marked as visited.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
