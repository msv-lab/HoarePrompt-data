Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of snow drifts `n` is 0. According to the problem description, if there are no snow drifts, the output should be 0 (since no additional snow drifts are needed). However, the function `func_4` incorrectly prints `-1` in this case. This is a violation of the problem specification, making the program incorrect.

Additionally, the program uses a global `visited` set and assumes that the `dfs` function is defined and accessible within the scope of `func_4`. While this is not a logical error, it is a design choice that could lead to issues in a larger program. However, for the purpose of this verification, the primary issue is the incorrect handling of the case where `n` is 0.
