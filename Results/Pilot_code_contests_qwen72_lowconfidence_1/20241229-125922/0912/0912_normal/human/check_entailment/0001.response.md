Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the coordinates of the snow drifts are not within the range of 1 to 1000. The dictionaries `mydict_x` and `mydict_y` are initialized with keys from 1 to 1000, but the problem statement specifies that the coordinates can be up to 1000, which means the coordinates can also be 0 or greater than 1000. This will lead to a `KeyError` when trying to access a key that does not exist in the dictionaries.

For example, if the input includes a snow drift at coordinates (0, 500) or (1001, 500), the program will fail because it tries to access `mydict_x[0]` or `mydict_x[1001]`, which do not exist.

To fix this, the dictionaries should be initialized dynamically or checked for the existence of the key before appending values.
