The function `func_1` reads a single line from standard input, removes any leading and trailing whitespace, splits the line into parts based on spaces, and converts each part into an integer. It returns a map object containing these integers. The actual content of the map object depends on the input provided. If the input line contains non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`. If the input line is empty or contains only whitespace, the function will return an empty map object.
