The provided Python code changes the definitions of the built-in functions `range` and `input`. The function `range` is now an alias for `xrange`, which is more memory-efficient for large ranges in Python 2.x, and `input` is now an alias for `raw_input`, which reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that. This does not affect the existing state of the variables `n`, `x1`, `x2`, ..., `xn`.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and x1, x2, ..., xn are a sequence of distinct integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. `range` is now an alias for `xrange`, and `input` is now an alias for `raw_input`.**
