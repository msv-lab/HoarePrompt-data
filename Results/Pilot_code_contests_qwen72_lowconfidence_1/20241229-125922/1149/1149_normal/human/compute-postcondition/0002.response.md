Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and x1, x2, ..., xn are a sequence of distinct integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. If the first character of `sys.version` is '2', `range` is now an alias for `xrange`, and `input` is now an alias for `raw_input`. Otherwise, there are no changes to the program state.***
