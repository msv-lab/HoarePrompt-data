Precondition: **mon, day, hour, min, and sec are integers representing a valid date and time in the year 2012, where 1 ≤ mon ≤ 12, 1 ≤ day ≤ 31, 0 ≤ hour ≤ 23, 0 ≤ min ≤ 59, and 0 ≤ sec ≤ 59.** However, this precondition does not fully capture the requirements of the problem as described. The function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should take the log entries and the parameters `n` and `m` as inputs, not individual date and time components. A more accurate function definition and precondition based on the problem description would be:

Function definition:
```python
def find_warning_time(n, m, log_entries):
```

Precondition: **n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000, and log_entries is a list of strings where each string is in the format "2012-MM-DD HH:MM:SS:MESSAGE" and represents a valid date and time in the year 2012, and MESSAGE contains only spaces, uppercase and lowercase English letters, and characters "!", ".", ",", "?".**
