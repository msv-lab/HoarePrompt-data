To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `mon`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `mon` is an integer between 1 and 12.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `day` is an integer between 1 and 31.
   - `hour` is an integer between 0 and 23.
   - `min` is an integer between 0 and 59.
   - `sec` is an integer between 0 and 59.
   - `mons` is a list `[31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]`.
   - `days` is 31.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The loop will continue if `i` is still less than `mon`.

Given that `i` is currently 0, the next value of `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `mon` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`mon` is an integer between 2 and 12, `i` is 1, `day` is an integer between 1 and 31, `hour` is an integer between 0 and 23, `min` is an integer between 0 and 59, `sec` is an integer between 0 and 59, `mons` is [31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31], `days` is 31**
