The value of `days` is incremented by the value of `mons[i]`. Since `i` is 2, `mons[i]` is `mons[2]`, which is 31. Therefore, `days` is incremented by 31.

The initial value of `days` is 60, so after the increment, `days` becomes 60 + 31 = 91.

The other variables (`mon`, `i`, `day`, `hour`, `min`, `sec`, and `mons`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mon` is an integer between 3 and 12, `i` is 2, `day` is an integer between 1 and 31, `hour` is an integer between 0 and 23, `min` is an integer between 0 and 59, `sec` is an integer between 0 and 59, `mons` is [31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31], `days` is 91**
