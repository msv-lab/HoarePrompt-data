The value of `days` is updated by adding the value of `mons[i]` to it. Since `i` is 1, `mons[1]` is 29 (from the list `[31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]`). Therefore, `days` becomes `31 + 29`, which equals 60.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mon` is an integer between 2 and 12, `i` is 1, `day` is an integer between 1 and 31, `hour` is an integer between 0 and 23, `min` is an integer between 0 and 59, `sec` is an integer between 0 and 59, `mons` is [31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31], `days` is 60**
