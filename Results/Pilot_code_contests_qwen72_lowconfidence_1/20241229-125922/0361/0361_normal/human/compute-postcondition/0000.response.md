The list `mons` is initialized with the number of days in each month for the year 2012 (a leap year). This does not affect the existing variables `mon`, `day`, `hour`, `min`, and `sec`. The initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the `mons` list.

Output State: **mon, day, hour, min, and sec are integers representing a valid date and time in the year 2012, where 1 ≤ mon ≤ 12, 1 ≤ day ≤ 31, 0 ≤ hour ≤ 23, 0 ≤ min ≤ 59, and 0 ≤ sec ≤ 59; mons = [31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]**
