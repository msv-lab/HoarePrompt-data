To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement.

### Given State:
- `mon`, `day`, `hour`, `min`, and `sec` are integers representing a valid date and time in the year 2012.
  - 1 ≤ `mon` ≤ 12
  - 1 ≤ `day` ≤ 31
  - 0 ≤ `hour` ≤ 23
  - 0 ≤ `min` ≤ 59
  - 0 ≤ `sec` ≤ 59
- `mons` = [31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]
- `days` = 0

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(mon):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop `for i in range(mon):` will execute if `mon` is greater than 0.
- Since `mon` represents the month and is constrained to be between 1 and 12, the loop will always execute at least once because `mon` cannot be 0.

### States to Adjust:
- The loop will execute as long as `mon` is within its valid range (1 to 12).
- The variable `i` is initialized by the loop and will start from 0.

### Final State:
- `mon` is an integer between 1 and 12.
- `i` is 0 (initialized by the loop).

### Conclusion:
Since the loop will always execute at least once given the constraints on `mon`, no additional adjustments are needed beyond ensuring `mon` is within its valid range.

State: **`mon` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `day` is an integer between 1 and 31, `hour` is an integer between 0 and 23, `min` is an integer between 0 and 59, `sec` is an integer between 0 and 59, `mons` is [31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31], `days` is 0**
