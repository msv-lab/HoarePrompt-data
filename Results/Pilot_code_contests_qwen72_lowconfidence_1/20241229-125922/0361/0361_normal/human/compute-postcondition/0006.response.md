To determine the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider how the loop variable `i` changes and what conditions must be met for the loop to continue executing.

Given:
- `mon` is an integer between 2 and 12.
- `i` is 1.
- `day` is an integer between 1 and 31.
- `hour` is an integer between 0 and 23.
- `min` is an integer between 0 and 59.
- `sec` is an integer between 0 and 59.
- `mons` is [31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31].
- `days` is 60.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(mon):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `mon`.
4. Therefore, `i` will be incremented to 2 at the start of the next iteration.
5. The condition for the loop to continue is that `mon` must be greater than 2.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`mon` is an integer between 3 and 12, `i` is 2, `day` is an integer between 1 and 31, `hour` is an integer between 0 and 23, `min` is an integer between 0 and 59, `sec` is an integer between 0 and 59, `mons` is [31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31], `days` is 60**
