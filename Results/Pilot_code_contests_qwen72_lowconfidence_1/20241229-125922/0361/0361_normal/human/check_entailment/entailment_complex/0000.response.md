Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program provided meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, which represent the duration in seconds and the minimum number of warnings, respectively.
   - It then reads the log entries from the standard input and processes them.

2. **Date and Time Parsing**:
   - For each log entry, the program extracts the date and time components (`MM`, `DD`, `HH`, `MIN`, `SEC`) and converts them into the total number of seconds since the start of the year 2012 using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function correctly converts the date and time into seconds, accounting for the correct number of days in each month, including February with 29 days (since 2012 is a leap year).

3. **Warning Counting**:
   - The program iterates through the list of times and counts the number of warnings within the last `n` seconds for each log entry.
   - It uses a while loop to find the number of warnings within the last `n` seconds by comparing the current time with the times of previous logs.
   - If the count of warnings reaches or exceeds `m`, the program prints the corresponding log entry's timestamp and exits.

4. **Output**:
   - If the program finds a moment where the number of warnings in the last `n` seconds is at least `m`, it prints the timestamp in the required format.
   - If no such moment is found, the program prints `-1`.

### Why It Is Correct:
- **Correct Parsing and Conversion**: The program correctly parses the date and time from each log entry and converts it into seconds since the start of the year 2012. This ensures that the time comparisons are accurate.
- **Efficient Warning Counting**: The program efficiently counts the number of warnings within the last `n` seconds by using a while loop to iterate backward through the list of times. This approach ensures that the program can handle large log files efficiently.
- **Correct Output Format**: The program prints the timestamp in the required format if the condition is met, and prints `-1` if it is not. This matches the problem description exactly.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Single Log Entry**: If the log has only one entry and `m` is greater than 1, the program correctly prints `-1`.
- **No Warnings in `n` Seconds**: If the log entries are spaced far apart such that no `n`-second window contains `m` warnings, the program correctly prints `-1`.
- **Multiple Warnings in a Single Second**: If multiple warnings occur in the same second, the program correctly counts them and can still meet the condition.

Given these points, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is therefore correct.
