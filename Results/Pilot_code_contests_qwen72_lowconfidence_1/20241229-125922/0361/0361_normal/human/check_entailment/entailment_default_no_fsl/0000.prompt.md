You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You've got a list of program warning logs. Each record of a log stream is a string in this format: 

"2012-MM-DD HH:MM:SS:MESSAGE" (without the quotes). 

String "MESSAGE" consists of spaces, uppercase and lowercase English letters and characters "!", ".", ",", "?". String "2012-MM-DD" determines a correct date in the year of 2012. String "HH:MM:SS" determines a correct time in the 24 hour format.

The described record of a log stream means that at a certain time the record has got some program warning (string "MESSAGE" contains the warning's description).

Your task is to print the first moment of time, when the number of warnings for the last n seconds was not less than m.

Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000).

The second and the remaining lines of the input represent the log stream. The second line of the input contains the first record of the log stream, the third line contains the second record and so on. Each record of the log stream has the above described format. All records are given in the chronological order, that is, the warning records are given in the order, in which the warnings appeared in the program. 

It is guaranteed that the log has at least one record. It is guaranteed that the total length of all lines of the log stream doesn't exceed 5·106 (in particular, this means that the length of some line does not exceed 5·106 characters). It is guaranteed that all given dates and times are correct, and the string 'MESSAGE" in all records is non-empty.

Output

If there is no sought moment of time, print -1. Otherwise print a string in the format "2012-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" (without the quotes) — the first moment of time when the number of warnings for the last n seconds got no less than m.

Program:
```
import sys

(n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
times = []
a = sys.stdin.readlines()
for i in range(len(a)):
    str1 = a[i]
    MM = int(str1[5:7])
    DD = int(str1[8:10])
    HH = int(str1[11:13])
    MIN = int(str1[14:16])
    SEC = int(str1[17:19])
    times.append(func_1(MM, DD, HH, MIN, SEC))
for i in range(len(times)):
    tmp = 0
    j = i
    bol = False
    while j >= 0 and times[i] - times[j] < n:
        j -= 1
        tmp += 1
    if tmp >= m:
        print(a[i][:19])
        exit()
print(-1)

def func_1(mon, day, hour, min, sec):
    mons = [31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]
    days = 0
    for i in range(mon):
        days += mons[i]
    return (days + day) * 86400 + 3600 * hour + 60 * min + sec


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes five parameters: `mon`, `day`, `hour`, `min`, and `sec`, which represent a valid date and time in the year 2012. It calculates and returns the total number of seconds elapsed since the start of the year 2012 up to the given date and time. The calculation accounts for the correct number of days in each month, including February with 29 days (since 2012 is a leap year). The function correctly handles the conversion of days, hours, minutes, and seconds into the total number of seconds. However, the function does not validate the input to ensure that the provided date and time are valid (e.g., it does not check if `day` is within the valid range for the given `mon`). If invalid inputs are provided, the function may return incorrect results.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
