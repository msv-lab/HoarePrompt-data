Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly implement the solution according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input values `n` and `m`, and then reads the log entries from standard input. It correctly parses the date and time from each log entry.

2. **Time Conversion**: The function `func_1` converts the date and time into a single integer representing the number of seconds since the start of the year. This conversion is accurate and handles leap years correctly (since 2012 is a leap year, February has 29 days).

3. **Sliding Window Check**: The program uses a sliding window approach to check the number of warnings within the last `n` seconds. It iterates through the list of converted times and counts the number of warnings within the last `n` seconds for each log entry. If the count reaches or exceeds `m`, it prints the corresponding log entry's timestamp and exits.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as the first log entry and the last log entry correctly. It also handles cases where no such moment exists by printing `-1`.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program seems to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
