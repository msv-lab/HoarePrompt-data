Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the first line to get the values of `n` and `m`.
   - It then reads the remaining lines from standard input, which represent the log entries.

2. **Time Conversion:**
   - For each log entry, the program extracts the date and time components (month, day, hour, minute, second).
   - It converts these components into the total number of seconds since the start of the year using the `func_1` function. This conversion ensures that the time is represented in a format that can be easily compared and manipulated.

3. **Sliding Window Check:**
   - The program iterates through the list of converted times.
   - For each time, it checks the number of warnings within the last `n` seconds using a sliding window approach.
   - If the number of warnings in the last `n` seconds is at least `m`, it prints the corresponding log entry and exits the program.

4. **Output:**
   - If a valid moment is found, the program prints the time in the required format.
   - If no such moment is found, the program prints `-1`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Time Conversion Function (`func_1`):**
  - The function correctly calculates the total number of seconds since the start of the year.
  - It handles the leap year (2012) by including February with 29 days.
  - The calculation ensures that the time is represented in a continuous and comparable format.

- **Sliding Window Logic:**
  - The program uses a while loop to count the number of warnings within the last `n` seconds.
  - It starts from the current time and moves backward until the difference in time exceeds `n` seconds.
  - This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies the first moment when the number of warnings in the last `n` seconds is at least `m`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where no such moment exists by printing `-1`.
  - It also correctly processes the log entries in chronological order, as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly parses the input, converts the times, and applies the sliding window logic to find the first moment when the number of warnings in the last `n` seconds is at least `m`. Therefore, the program is correct.
