The function `func_1` takes five parameters: `mon`, `day`, `hour`, `min`, and `sec`, which represent a valid date and time in the year 2012. It calculates and returns the total number of seconds elapsed since the start of the year 2012 up to the given date and time. The calculation accounts for the correct number of days in each month, including February with 29 days (since 2012 is a leap year). The function correctly handles the conversion of days, hours, minutes, and seconds into the total number of seconds. However, the function does not validate the input to ensure that the provided date and time are valid (e.g., it does not check if `day` is within the valid range for the given `mon`). If invalid inputs are provided, the function may return incorrect results.
