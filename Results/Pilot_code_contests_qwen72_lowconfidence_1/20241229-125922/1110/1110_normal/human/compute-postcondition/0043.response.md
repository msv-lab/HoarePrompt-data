Output State: **`one` is a non-empty list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `to` is a list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (to[-1] if to else -1)` and do not satisfy the condition for `one`, `idx` is a sorted list of indices based on `val`, `val` is a list of integers with `val[ix] = 1`, `n` is the length of `val`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, and the combined length of `one` and `to` is equal to `n`.**
