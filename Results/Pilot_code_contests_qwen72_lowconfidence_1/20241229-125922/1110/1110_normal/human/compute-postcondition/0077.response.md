The code `to.append(ix)` adds the current value of `ix` to the end of the list `to`. This impacts the state of the `to` list, which was initially an empty list.

Since `to` is now updated to include `ix`, the new state of `to` is `[ix]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, except for the fact that `to` is no longer an empty list.

The condition that `ix` is greater than the last element of `to` if `to` is not empty, or `ix` is greater than -1 if `to` is empty, remains valid because `ix` was appended to `to`, making `to` non-empty and ensuring that `ix` is indeed greater than the last element (which is now `ix` itself).

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is an empty list, `to` is `[ix]`, `idx` is a non-empty list of indices sorted based on the values in `val` at the indices specified by `idx` and in case of ties, the indices themselves, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`, and either `ix <= (one[-1] if one else -1)` or `val[ix] > (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`. Additionally, the current value of `ix` is greater than the last element of `to` if `to` is not empty, or `ix` is greater than -1 if `to` is empty.**
