To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop structure step by step.

### Given State:
- `ix` is the next element in `idx`.
- Conditions for appending `ix` to `one` or `to`:
  - If `ix` is greater than the last element of `one` (or -1 if `one` is empty) and `val[ix]` is less than or equal to the first element of `to` (or infinity if `to` is empty), then `ix` is appended to `one`.
  - Otherwise, if `ix` is greater than the last element of `to` (or -1 if `to` is empty), `ix` is appended to `to`.
  - If neither condition is met, `one` remains unchanged from the previous iteration, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for ix in idx:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `idx` to iterate over.
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - `ix` must be the next element in `idx`.
   - The conditions for appending `ix` to `one` or `to` must be checked.
   - If `ix` is appended to `one` or `to`, the respective lists (`one` or `to`) will be updated.
   - If neither condition is met, the loop will break.

### Adjusted State:
- `ix` must be the next element in `idx`.
- `one` and `to` may be updated based on the conditions.
- The loop will break if neither condition is met.

### Final State:
State: **`ix` is the next element in `idx`, `one` and `to` may be updated based on the conditions, the loop will break if neither condition is met**.
