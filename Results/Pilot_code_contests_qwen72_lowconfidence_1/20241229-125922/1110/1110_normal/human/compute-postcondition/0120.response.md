Postcondition: ***_ is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop, `one` contains indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1)` and `val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `to` contains indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (to[-1] if to else -1)` and `val[ix] > (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `idx` is a sorted list of indices based on `val` and ties resolved by the indices themselves, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, and `n` is the value returned by `gil()`. If `len(one) + len(to) == n`, then `_` is incremented by the length of `one` from the initial state, `one` and `to` remain unchanged, `val[ix]` is 2 for all elements `ix` in the original `to`, `to` must have had at least 1 element if the loop executed, `ix` is the last element in the original `to` after the loop finishes, all elements in `val` have been printed without newline characters. If `to` was empty, the loop did not execute, and `val[ix]` remains 1 for all `ix` in `one`. A newline character has been printed. Otherwise, the sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is less than `n`.***
