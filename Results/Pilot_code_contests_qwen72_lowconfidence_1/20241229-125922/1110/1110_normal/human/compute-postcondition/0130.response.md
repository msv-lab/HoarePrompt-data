The code snippet `one.append(ix)` adds the value of `ix` to the end of the list `one`. Let's go through the changes step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `one` is an empty list.
   - `to` is an empty list.
   - `idx` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` where `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`.
   - The sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is 0 (less than `n`).
   - `n` is the value returned by `gil()`.
   - `ix` is the first element in `idx`.
   - `ix` is greater than the last element of `one` (or -1 if `one` is empty) and `val[ix]` is less than or equal to the value at the first element of `to` (or infinity if `to` is empty).

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - `one.append(ix)` appends the value of `ix` to the list `one`.

3. **Updated State**:
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `one` is now a list containing one element, which is the value of `ix`.
   - `to` remains an empty list.
   - `idx` remains a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` where `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`.
   - The sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is 1 (still less than `n`).
   - `n` is the value returned by `gil()`.
   - `ix` is the first element in `idx`.
   - `ix` is greater than the last element of `one` (which is now `ix`) and `val[ix]` is less than or equal to the value at the first element of `to` (or infinity if `to` is empty).

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is [ix], `to` is an empty list, `idx` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` where `n` must be greater than 0, `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`, the sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is 1 (less than `n`), `n` is the value returned by `gil()`, `ix` is the first element in `idx`, and `ix` is greater than the last element of `one` (which is `ix`) and `val[ix]` is less than or equal to the value at the first element of `to` (or infinity if `to` is empty).**
