The value of `val` is updated to the value returned by the function `gbs()`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is a list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `to` is a list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (to[-1] if to else -1)` and do not satisfy the condition for `one`, `idx` is a sorted list of indices based on `val`, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`**
