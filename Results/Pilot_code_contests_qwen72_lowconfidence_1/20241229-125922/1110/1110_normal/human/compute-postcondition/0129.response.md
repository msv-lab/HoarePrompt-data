Postcondition: ***`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is an empty list, `to` is an empty list, `idx` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` where `n` must be greater than 0, `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`, the sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is 0 (less than `n`), `n` is the value returned by `gil()`, `ix` is the first element in `idx`, and `ix` is greater than the last element of `one` (or -1 if `one` is empty) and `val[ix]` is less than or equal to the value at the first element of `to` (or infinity if `to` is empty).***
