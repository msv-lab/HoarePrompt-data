The value `ix` is appended to the list `one`. The other variables (`_`, `to`, `idx`, `val`, `n`) remain unchanged. The sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is now 1, 2, 3, or 4 (as `one` has gained an additional element).

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is now either `[next_ix, ix, ix]`, `[ix, ix]`, `[next_ix, ix]`, or `[ix]`, `to` is either `[next_ix, ix]`, `[ix]`, `[next_ix]`, or remains the same, the sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is 1, 2, 3, or 4 (less than or equal to `n`), `idx` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` where `n` must be greater than 0, `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`, `ix` is the next element in `idx`. If the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)` is not met, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
