The code snippet `print()` adds a newline character to the output. This does not affect the state of any variables in the program.

Output State: **`to` is a list of integers from `idx`, `_` is incremented by 1, `one` is a list of integers from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `idx` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` sorted based on the values in `val` and the original index positions, `val` is updated such that `val[ix]` is 2 for all `ix` in `to`, the sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is equal to `n`, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`, and if `n` is greater than 0, all elements in `val` have been printed without newlines. If `n` is 0, `val` is an empty list and nothing is printed.**
