To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and the state transitions:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `idx`, which is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`. For the loop to continue, `ix` must be the next element in `idx`.

2. **State Variables**:
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `one` and `to` are lists of integers with specific configurations.
   - The sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is 0, 1, 2, or 3 (less than or equal to `n`).
   - `idx` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`.
   - `n` is the value returned by `gil()`.
   - `ix` is the next element in `idx`.

3. **Break Condition**: The loop breaks if the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)` is not met.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Increment `_`**: Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, it will be incremented again at the start of the next iteration.
2. **Update `ix`**: `ix` will be the next element in `idx`. If `ix` was the current element, the next `ix` will be the subsequent element in the list `idx`.
3. **Update `val`**: `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()` at the start of each iteration.
4. **Check `one` and `to`**: The lists `one` and `to` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless modified within the loop body.
5. **Check `n`**: `n` remains the same as it is returned by `gil()` and does not change between iterations.
6. **Check Break Condition**: The break condition must still be evaluated with the new `ix` and `val`.

### Adjusted State:

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `ix` is the next element in `idx`.
- `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`.
- `one` and `to` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
- `idx` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- The break condition must still be checked with the new `ix` and `val`.

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `one` and `to` are lists of integers where `one` is either `[next_ix, ix]`, `[ix]`, or remains the same, and `to` is either `[next_ix, ix]`, `[ix]`, `[next_ix]`, or remains the same. The sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is 0, 1, 2, or 3 (less than or equal to `n`). `idx` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` where `n` must be greater than 0, `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`, and `n` is the value returned by `gil()`. `ix` is the next element in `idx`. If the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)` is not met, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
