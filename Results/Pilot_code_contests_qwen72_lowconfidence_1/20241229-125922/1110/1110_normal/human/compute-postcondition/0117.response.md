The `print()` function is called, which prints a newline character. This does not change any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **_ is incremented by the length of `one` from the initial state, `one` remains unchanged, `to` remains unchanged, `idx` remains unchanged, `val` remains unchanged, `inf` is `float('inf')`, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`, `val[ix]` is 2 for all elements `ix` in the original `to`, `to` must have had at least 1 element if the loop executed, `ix` is the last element in the original `to` after the loop finishes, all elements in `val` have been printed without newline characters. If `to` was empty, the loop did not execute, and `val[ix]` remains 1 for all `ix` in `one`. A newline character has been printed.**
