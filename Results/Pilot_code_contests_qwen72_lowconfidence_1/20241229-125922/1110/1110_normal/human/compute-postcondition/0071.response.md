The code snippet sets `to` to an empty list. This overrides the previous value of `to`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is an empty list, `to` is an empty list, `idx` is sorted based on the values in `val` at the indices specified by `idx` and in case of ties, the indices themselves, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`**
