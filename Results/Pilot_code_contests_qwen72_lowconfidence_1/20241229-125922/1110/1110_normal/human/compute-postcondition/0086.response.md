Postcondition: ***`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is a list that may contain the value of `ix` if `ix` is greater than `(one[-1] if one else -1)` and `val[ix]` is less than or equal to `(val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, otherwise `one` remains an empty list. If `ix` is greater than `(to[-1] if to else -1)`, `to` is a list containing `ix` as its last element. Otherwise, if `ix` is greater than `(to[-1] if to else -1)` and `val[ix]` is greater than `(val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `to` is updated to `[ix]`. If neither condition is met, `to` remains an empty list or the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional block. `idx` is a non-empty list of indices with at least one more element, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, and `n` is the value returned by `gil()`***.
