To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition.

### Given Information:
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `one` is either `[ix]` or an empty list.
- `to` is either `[ix]` or an empty list.
- `idx` is a list of integers from `0` to `n-1` where `n` must be greater than 0.
- `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`.
- The sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is 0, 1, or 2 (less than `n`).
- `n` is the value returned by `gil()`.
- `ix` is the first element in `idx`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over each element in `idx`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State:**
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `one` is either `[ix]` or an empty list.
   - `to` is either `[ix]` or an empty list.
   - `idx` is a list of integers from `0` to `n-1` where `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`.
   - The sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is 0, 1, or 2 (less than `n`).
   - `n` is the value returned by `gil()`.
   - `ix` is the first element in `idx`.

2. **Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `idx`.
   - After the current iteration, `ix` will move to the next element in `idx`.
   - The state of `one` and `to` will depend on the conditions provided in the problem statement.

### Adjusted States:
- `ix` will be the next element in `idx`.
- `_` will be incremented by 1.
- `one` and `to` will be updated based on the conditions provided.

### Detailed Adjustments:
- **`ix`**: The next element in `idx`.
- **`_`**: Incremented by 1.
- **`one` and `to`**: Updated based on the conditions:
  - If `ix` is greater than the last element of `one` (or -1 if `one` is empty) and `val[ix]` is less than or equal to the value at the first element of `to` (or infinity if `to` is empty), then `one` is `[ix]` and `to` is an empty list.
  - Otherwise, if `ix` is greater than the last element of `to` (or -1 if `to` is empty), then `to` is `[ix]`.
  - If neither of these conditions is met, `one` and `to` remain as they were.

### Final State:
State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is either [next_ix] or remains the same, `to` is either [next_ix] or remains the same, `idx` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` where `n` must be greater than 0, `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`, the sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is 0, 1, or 2 (less than `n`), `n` is the value returned by `gil()`, `ix` is the next element in `idx`.**
