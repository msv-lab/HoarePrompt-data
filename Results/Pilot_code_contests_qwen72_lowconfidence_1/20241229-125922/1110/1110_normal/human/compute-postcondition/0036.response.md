Postcondition: ***`ix` is the next element in `idx`. If `ix` is greater than the last element of `to` (or -1 if `to` is empty), `to` now includes `ix` as its last element. Otherwise, the loop is broken. In both cases, `one` and `to` may be updated based on the conditions, and the loop will break if neither condition is met.***
