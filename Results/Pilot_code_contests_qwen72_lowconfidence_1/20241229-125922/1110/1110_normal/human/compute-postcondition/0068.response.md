The code `idx = list(xrange(n))` creates a new list `idx` containing integers from 0 to `n-1`. This operation does not affect the values of `_`, `one`, `to`, `val`, `inf`, or `n`.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is a list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `to` is a list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (to[-1] if to else -1)` and do not satisfy the condition for `one`, `idx` is a sorted list of indices `[0, 1, ..., n-1]` based on `val`, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`**
