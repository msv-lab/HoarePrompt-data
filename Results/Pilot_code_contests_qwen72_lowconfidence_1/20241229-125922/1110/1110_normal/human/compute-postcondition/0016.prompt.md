You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?


Example Answer 1:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?


Example Answer 2:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: `inf` is `float('inf')`, `gbs` is a function that reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and converts each element in the resulting list of strings to an integer, `gfl` is a function that reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each string in the list to a float, `t` is the first integer read from `stdin` using `gil` and must be greater than 0, `g` reads a line from `stdin` and returns it stripped, `gl` reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and splits it into a list of strings, `gil` converts a list of strings (read by `gl`) into a list of integers, `gcl` reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and returns it as a list, `mod` is 1000000007, `_` is 0, `n` is the integer read from `stdin`, `val` is a list of integers read from `stdin`, `idx` is a list containing integers from 0 to `n-1` sorted by the values in `val` and then by their original indices, `one` is an empty list, `to` is an empty list
```
for ix in idx:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?
