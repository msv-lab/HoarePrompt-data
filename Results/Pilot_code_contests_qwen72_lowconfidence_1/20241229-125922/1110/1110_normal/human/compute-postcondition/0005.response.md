The code snippet defines a new function `gbs` which reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and converts each element in the resulting list of strings to an integer.

- `gbs` is now defined as a lambda function that reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and converts each element in the resulting list of strings to an integer.
- The definitions of `gfl`, `t`, `g`, `gl`, `gil`, and `gcl` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`gbs` is a function that reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and converts each element in the resulting list of strings to an integer; `gfl` is a function that reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each string in the list to a float; `t` represents the number of test cases; `g` reads a line from `stdin` and returns it stripped; `gl` reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and splits it into a list of strings; `gil` converts a list of strings (read by `gl`) into a list of integers; `gcl` reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and returns it as a list.**
