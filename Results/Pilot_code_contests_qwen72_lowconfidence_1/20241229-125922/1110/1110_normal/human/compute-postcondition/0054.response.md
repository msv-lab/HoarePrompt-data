To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will start and iterate. The loop iterates over each element in the `val` list. For the loop to execute, `val` must be a non-empty list.

Given the initial state:
- `one` is a non-empty list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] = 1`
- `to` is a list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (to[-1] if to else -1)` and do not satisfy the condition for `one`
- `idx` is a sorted list of indices based on `val`
- `val` is a list of integers where `val[ix] = 1` for all `ix` in `one` and `val[ix] = 2` for all `ix` in `to`
- `n` is the length of `val`
- `inf` is `float('inf')`
- The combined length of `one` and `to` is equal to `n`

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. `val` must be a non-empty list. This is already implied by the given state since `n` is the length of `val` and the combined length of `one` and `to` is equal to `n`.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. The loop will run as long as `val` is non-empty, which is guaranteed by the given state.

State: **`one` is a non-empty list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] = 1`, `to` is a list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (to[-1] if to else -1)` and do not satisfy the condition for `one`, `idx` is a sorted list of indices based on `val`, `val` is a list of integers where `val[ix] = 1` for all `ix` in `one` and `val[ix] = 2` for all `ix` in `to`, `n` is the length of `val`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, and the combined length of `one` and `to` is equal to `n`**
