The code snippet `val = gbs()` reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and converts each element in the resulting list of strings to an integer, assigning this list to `val`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`inf` is `float('inf')`, `gbs` is a function that reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and converts each element in the resulting list of strings to an integer, `gfl` is a function that reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each string in the list to a float, `t` is the first integer read from `stdin` using `gil` and must be greater than 0, `g` reads a line from `stdin` and returns it stripped, `gl` reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and splits it into a list of strings, `gil` converts a list of strings (read by `gl`) into a list of integers, `gcl` reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and returns it as a list, `mod` is 1000000007, `_` is 0, `n` is the integer read from `stdin`, `val` is a list of integers read from `stdin`**
