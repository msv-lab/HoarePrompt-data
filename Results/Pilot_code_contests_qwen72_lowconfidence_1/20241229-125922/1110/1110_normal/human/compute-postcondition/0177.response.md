Output State: **`_` is incremented by `t` (the number of iterations specified by `t`), `one` is a list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `to` is a list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (to[-1] if to else -1)` and do not satisfy the condition for `one`, `idx` is a sorted list of indices based on `val`, `val` is a list of integers, `n` is the length of `val`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, and all other variables remain unchanged from their initial values. For each iteration, if the combined length of `one` and `to` is equal to `n`, then `one` is a non-empty list and `val[ix] = 1` for all `ix` in `one` and `val[ix] = 2` for all `ix` in `to`. The values in `val` are printed without newline characters, followed by a newline character. If the combined length of `one` and `to` is less than `n` for any iteration, a single hyphen (`-`) is printed. After all iterations, `one` and `to` are reset for each new iteration, and the final state of `val` depends on the last iteration where `len(one) + len(to) == n`. If no such iteration exists, `val` retains its original value for each iteration.**
