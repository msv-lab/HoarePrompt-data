To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement.

### Given State:
- `inf` is `float('inf')`
- `gbs` is a function that reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and converts each element in the resulting list of strings to an integer.
- `gfl` is a function that reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each string in the list to a float.
- `t` is the first integer read from `stdin` using `gil`.
- `g` reads a line from `stdin` and returns it stripped.
- `gl` reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and splits it into a list of strings.
- `gil` converts a list of strings (read by `gl`) into a list of integers.
- `gcl` reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and returns it as a list.
- `mod` is 1000000007

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute based on the value of `t`.
- The loop will run `t` times, where `t` is the first integer read from `stdin` using the `gil` function.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- The variable `_` is the loop counter, which starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`inf` is `float('inf')`, `gbs` is a function that reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and converts each element in the resulting list of strings to an integer, `gfl` is a function that reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each string in the list to a float, `t` is the first integer read from `stdin` using `gil` and must be greater than 0, `g` reads a line from `stdin` and returns it stripped, `gl` reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and splits it into a list of strings, `gil` converts a list of strings (read by `gl`) into a list of integers, `gcl` reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and returns it as a list, `mod` is 1000000007, `_` is 0**
