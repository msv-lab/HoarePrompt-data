Postcondition: ***`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is an empty list, `to` is an empty list, `idx` is a non-empty list of indices sorted based on the values in `val` at the indices specified by `idx` and in case of ties, the indices themselves, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`. Additionally, `ix` is greater than `-1` (since `one` is empty), and `val[ix]` is less than or equal to `inf` (since `to` is empty).***
