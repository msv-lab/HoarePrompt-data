Output State: **`one` is a non-empty list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] = 1`, `to` is a list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (to[-1] if to else -1)` and do not satisfy the condition for `one`, `idx` is a sorted list of indices based on `val`, `val` is a list of integers where `val[ix] = 1` for all `ix` in `one` and `val[ix] = 2` for all `ix` in `to`, `n` is the length of `val`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, and the combined length of `one` and `to` is equal to `n`. The loop prints each value in `val` exactly once, so the values of `val` are printed in the order they appear in the list.**
