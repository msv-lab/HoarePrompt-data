To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions and the state before the loop:

### Given State:
- `_` is incremented by the length of `one`.
- `one` contains indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1)` and `val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`.
- `to` contains indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (to[-1] if to else -1)` and `val[ix] > (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`.
- `idx` is a sorted list of indices based on `val` and ties resolved by the indices themselves.
- `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`.
- `inf` is `float('inf')`.
- `n` is the value returned by `gil()`.
- The combined length of `one` and `to` is equal to `n`.
- `val[ix]` is 1 for all `ix` in `one`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for ix in to:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `to` is not an empty list. This is because the loop iterates over the elements in `to`.

2. **State Adjustments**:
   - **`to` must not be empty**: For the loop to execute, `to` must contain at least one element. If `to` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - **`ix` is the first element in `to`**: Before the loop starts, `ix` should be the first element in `to`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, `to` must contain at least one element, and `ix` should be the first element in `to`.

### Final State:
State: **`_` is incremented by the length of `one`, `one` contains indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1)` and `val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `to` contains indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (to[-1] if to else -1)` and `val[ix] > (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `idx` is a sorted list of indices based on `val` and ties resolved by the indices themselves, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`, the combined length of `one` and `to` is equal to `n`, `val[ix]` is 1 for all `ix` in `one`, `to` must have at least 1 element, `ix` is the first element in `to`**
