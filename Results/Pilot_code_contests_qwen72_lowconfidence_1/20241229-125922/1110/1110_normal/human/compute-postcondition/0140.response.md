The code `to.append(ix)` appends the value of `ix` to the list `to`. This impacts the length of `to`, which increases by 1. Since `ix` is the next element in `idx`, the new element added to `to` is the next integer in the sequence from 0 to `n-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `one` is either `[next_ix]` or remains the same.
- `to` is either `[next_ix]` or remains the same.
- `idx` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` where `n` must be greater than 0.
- `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`.
- The sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is 0, 1, or 2 (less than `n`).
- `n` is the value returned by `gil()`.
- `ix` is the next element in `idx`.

After executing the code:
- The length of `to` increases by 1, and `ix` is appended to `to`.
- All other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is either `[next_ix]` or remains the same, `to` is either `[next_ix, ix]` or `[ix]` or `[next_ix]` depending on the initial state, `idx` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` where `n` must be greater than 0, `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`, the sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is 1, 2, or 3 (less than or equal to `n`), `n` is the value returned by `gil()`, `ix` is the next element in `idx`.**
