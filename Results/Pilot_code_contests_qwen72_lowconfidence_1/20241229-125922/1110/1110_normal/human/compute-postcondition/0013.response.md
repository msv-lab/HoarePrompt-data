The `idx` list is sorted based on the values in the `val` list at the corresponding indices, and in case of ties, the original indices are used as a tiebreaker. This means that after sorting, `idx` will contain the indices of the elements in `val` in ascending order of their values, and if two elements in `val` have the same value, they will appear in the order of their original indices.

The values of the other variables (`inf`, `gbs`, `gfl`, `t`, `g`, `gl`, `gil`, `gcl`, `mod`, `_`, `n`, `val`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`inf` is `float('inf')`, `gbs` is a function that reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and converts each element in the resulting list of strings to an integer, `gfl` is a function that reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each string in the list to a float, `t` is the first integer read from `stdin` using `gil` and must be greater than 0, `g` reads a line from `stdin` and returns it stripped, `gl` reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and splits it into a list of strings, `gil` converts a list of strings (read by `gl`) into a list of integers, `gcl` reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and returns it as a list, `mod` is 1000000007, `_` is 0, `n` is the integer read from `stdin`, `val` is a list of integers read from `stdin`, `idx` is a list containing integers from 0 to `n-1` sorted by the values in `val` and then by their original indices**
