Postcondition: ***`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is a list of integers from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `to` is a list of integers from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (to[-1] if to else -1)`, `idx` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` sorted based on the values in `val` and the original index positions, `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`, the sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is equal to `n`, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`***
