Postcondition: ***`_` is incremented by 1, `one` and `to` are lists of integers. If `ix > (to[-1] if to else -1)`, then `to` is updated to include `ix`, and the sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is 1, 2, 3, or 4 (less than or equal to `n`). Otherwise, the sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` remains 0, 1, 2, or 3 (less than or equal to `n`). `idx` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` where `n` must be greater than 0, `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`, `ix` is the next element in `idx`. If the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)` is not met, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
