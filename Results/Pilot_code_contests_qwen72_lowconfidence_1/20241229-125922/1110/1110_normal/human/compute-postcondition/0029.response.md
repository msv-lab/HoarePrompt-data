The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional structure it is currently within. The values of the variables `ix`, `one`, and `to` remain unchanged, but the flow of control is altered to exit the current loop or condition.

Output State: **`ix` is the next element in `idx`, `one` is a list that may have had an element added in the previous iteration, `to` is a list that may have had an element added in the previous iteration, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
