The value of `val[ix]` is set to 1. This does not change the conditions or the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. The initial state remains valid with the only change being the assignment of `val[ix]` to 1.

Output State: **`one` must contain at least two elements, `_` is incremented by 1, `one` contains indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1)` and `val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `to` contains indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (to[-1] if to else -1)` and `val[ix] > (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `idx` is a sorted list of indices based on `val` and ties resolved by the indices themselves, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`, and the combined length of `one` and `to` is equal to `n`, `val[ix]` is 1.**
