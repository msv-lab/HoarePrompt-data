To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given Information:
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `ix` is the current index from the list `idx`.
- `one` is a list that may contain `ix` under certain conditions.
- `to` is a list that may contain `ix` under different conditions.
- `idx` is a non-empty list of indices with at least one more element.
- `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`.
- `inf` is `float('inf')`.
- `n` is the value returned by `gil()`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for ix in idx:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Conditions:
1. If `ix` is greater than `(one[-1] if one else -1)` and `val[ix]` is less than or equal to `(val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `one` is a list containing `ix`. Otherwise, `one` remains an empty list.
2. If `ix` is greater than `(to[-1] if to else -1)` and `val[ix]` is greater than `(val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `to` is updated to `[ix]`. Otherwise, `to` remains an empty list.
3. If neither condition is met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional block.

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements of `idx`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `idx` after the current `ix`.

### Adjusting the States:
- The current `ix` will be the next element in `idx`.
- The lists `one` and `to` may be updated based on the conditions provided.

### Updated State:
- `ix` is the next element in `idx`.
- The lists `one` and `to` may change based on the conditions, but we cannot determine their exact values without knowing the specific values of `val` and the current state of `one` and `to`.

Given the information, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next `ix` and the potential updates to `one` and `to`.

### Final State:
State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `ix` is the next element in `idx`, `one` and `to` may be updated based on the conditions, `idx` is a non-empty list of indices with at least one more element, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, and `n` is the value returned by `gil()`**.
