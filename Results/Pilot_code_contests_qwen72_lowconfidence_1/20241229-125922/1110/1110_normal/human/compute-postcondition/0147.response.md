The `break` statement causes an immediate exit from the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables are not changed by this statement, but the flow of the program is affected.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `one` and `to` are lists of integers where `one` is either `[next_ix, ix]`, `[ix]`, or remains the same, and `to` is either `[next_ix, ix]`, `[ix]`, `[next_ix]`, or remains the same. The sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is 0, 1, 2, or 3 (less than or equal to `n`).
- `idx` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` where `n` must be greater than 0.
- `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`.
- `n` is the value returned by `gbs()`.
- `ix` is the next element in `idx`.
- If the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)` is not met, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it does cause the program to exit the current loop or if statement.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `one` and `to` are lists of integers where `one` is either `[next_ix, ix]`, `[ix]`, or remains the same, and `to` is either `[next_ix, ix]`, `[ix]`, `[next_ix]`, or remains the same. The sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is 0, 1, 2, or 3 (less than or equal to `n`). `idx` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` where `n` must be greater than 0, `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`, `ix` is the next element in `idx`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
