Postcondition: ***`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is an empty list, `idx` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` where `n` must be greater than 0, `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`, the sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is either 0 or 1 (less than `n`), `n` is the value returned by `gil()`, `ix` is the first element in `idx`, and either `ix` is less than or equal to `(one[-1] if one else -1)` or `val[ix]` is greater than `(val[to[0]] if to else inf)`. If `ix` is greater than `(to[-1] if to else -1)`, `to` is a list containing `[ix]`. Otherwise, `to` remains an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
