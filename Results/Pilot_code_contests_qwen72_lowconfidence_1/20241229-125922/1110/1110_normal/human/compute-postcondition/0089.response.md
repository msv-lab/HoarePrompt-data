The code snippet `one.append(ix)` appends the value of `ix` to the list `one`. This operation modifies the list `one` but does not affect the other variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`_` is incremented by 1, `ix` is the next element in `idx`, `one` now includes the value of `ix`, `to` may be updated based on the conditions, `idx` is a non-empty list of indices with at least one more element, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, and `n` is the value returned by `gil()`**
