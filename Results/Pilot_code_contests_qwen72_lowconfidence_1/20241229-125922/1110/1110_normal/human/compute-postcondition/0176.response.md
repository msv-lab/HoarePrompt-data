Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is a list of integers from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `to` is a list of integers from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (to[-1] if to else -1)`, `idx` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` sorted based on the values in `val` and the original index positions, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`. If `len(one) + len(to) == n`, `val` is updated such that `val[ix]` is 2 for all `ix` in `to`, and if `n` is greater than 0, all elements in `val` have been printed without newlines. If `n` is 0, `val` is an empty list and nothing is printed. Otherwise, if `len(one) + len(to) < n`, `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`.**
