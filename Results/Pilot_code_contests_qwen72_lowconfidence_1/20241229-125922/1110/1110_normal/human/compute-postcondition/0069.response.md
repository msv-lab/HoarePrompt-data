The code snippet `idx.sort(key=lambda x: [val[x], x])` sorts the list `idx` based on the values in `val` at the indices specified by `idx`, and in case of ties, it uses the index itself for sorting. This means that after the sort, `idx` will be ordered such that the elements of `val` are in ascending order, and within ties, the original indices are in ascending order.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `one` is a list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`
- `to` is a list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (to[-1] if to else -1)` and do not satisfy the condition for `one`
- `idx` is a sorted list of indices `[0, 1, ..., n-1]` based on `val`
- `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`
- `inf` is `float('inf')`
- `n` is the value returned by `gil()`

After executing the code snippet, the only change is in the `idx` list, which is now sorted according to the new key.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is a list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `to` is a list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (to[-1] if to else -1)` and do not satisfy the condition for `one`, `idx` is sorted based on the values in `val` at the indices specified by `idx` and in case of ties, the indices themselves, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`**
