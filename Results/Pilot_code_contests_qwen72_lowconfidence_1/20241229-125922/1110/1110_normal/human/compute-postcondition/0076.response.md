Postcondition: ***`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is an empty list, `to` is an empty list, `idx` is a non-empty list of indices sorted based on the values in `val` at the indices specified by `idx` and in case of ties, the indices themselves, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`, and either `ix <= (one[-1] if one else -1)` or `val[ix] > (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`. Additionally, the current value of `ix` is greater than the last element of `to` if `to` is not empty, or `ix` is greater than -1 if `to` is empty.***
