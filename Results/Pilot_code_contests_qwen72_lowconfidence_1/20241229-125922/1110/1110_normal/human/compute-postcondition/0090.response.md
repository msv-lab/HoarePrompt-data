The code `to.append(ix)` adds the current value of `ix` to the list `to`. This modifies the list `to` but does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `ix` is the next element in `idx`, `one` and `to` may be updated based on the conditions, `idx` is a non-empty list of indices with at least one more element, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`, `to` includes the new element `ix`**
