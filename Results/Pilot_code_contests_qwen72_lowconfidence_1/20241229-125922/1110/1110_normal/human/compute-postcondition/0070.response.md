The code snippet provided resets the list `one` to an empty list. This impacts the state of the variable `one`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is an empty list, `to` is a list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (to[-1] if to else -1)` and do not satisfy the condition for `one`, `idx` is sorted based on the values in `val` at the indices specified by `idx` and in case of ties, the indices themselves, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`**
