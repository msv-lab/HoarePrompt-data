The code snippet `t, = gil()` calls the function `gil()`, which reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and splits it into a list of strings, then converts each string in the list to an integer. The first (and only) integer in the resulting list is assigned to the variable `t`.

Since `t` is now assigned the value of the first integer read from `stdin` using `gil()`, the initial state of `t` representing the number of test cases is updated to reflect this specific value.

The other variables and functions (`inf`, `gbs`, `gfl`, `g`, `gl`, `gil`, `gcl`, `mod`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`inf` is `float('inf')`, `gbs` is a function that reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and converts each element in the resulting list of strings to an integer; `gfl` is a function that reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each string in the list to a float; `t` is the first integer read from `stdin` using `gil`; `g` reads a line from `stdin` and returns it stripped; `gl` reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and splits it into a list of strings; `gil` converts a list of strings (read by `gl`) into a list of integers; `gcl` reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and returns it as a list; `mod` is 1000000007**
