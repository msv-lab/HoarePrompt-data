The value of `val[ix]` is updated to 2. Given that `ix` is the first element in `to`, and initially `val[ix]` was 1 for all `ix` in `one`, this update changes the value at the index `ix` in `val`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`_` is incremented by the length of `one`, `one` contains indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1)` and `val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `to` contains indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (to[-1] if to else -1)` and `val[ix] > (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `idx` is a sorted list of indices based on `val` and ties resolved by the indices themselves, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`, the combined length of `one` and `to` is equal to `n`, `val[ix]` is 2 for the first element `ix` in `to`, `to` must have at least 1 element, `ix` is the first element in `to`.**
