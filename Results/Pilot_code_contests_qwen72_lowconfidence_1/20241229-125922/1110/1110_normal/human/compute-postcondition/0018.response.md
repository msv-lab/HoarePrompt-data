The code `one.append(ix)` adds the value of `ix` to the end of the list `one`. Given that `ix` is greater than the last element of the list `one` (or -1 if `one` is empty), this condition remains true after appending `ix`. Additionally, the value of `val[ix]` being less than or equal to the value of `val[to[0]]` (or infinity if `to` is empty) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`ix` is greater than the last element of the list `one` (which now includes `ix`), and the value of `val[ix]` is less than or equal to the value of `val[to[0]]` (or infinity if `to` is empty).**
