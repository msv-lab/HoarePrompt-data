To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and the current state:

1. **Current State:**
   - `ix` is greater than the last element of the list `one` (or -1 if `one` is empty).
   - The value of `val[ix]` is less than or equal to the value of `val[to[0]]` (or infinity if `to` is empty).
   - If both conditions are met, `ix` is added to the list `one`.
   - Otherwise, if `ix` is greater than the last element of the list `to` (or -1 if `to` is empty), `ix` is added to the list `to` as its last element.
   - If neither condition is met, the loop or if statement is exited.

2. **Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `ix` will be updated to the next element in `idx`.
   - We need to check if the new `ix` meets the conditions for being added to `one` or `to`.

3. **Adjustments:**
   - The new `ix` will be the next element in `idx`.
   - The lists `one` and `to` may have been modified in the previous iteration based on the conditions.

Given the current state, the next iteration will depend on the next value of `ix` from `idx` and the updated states of `one` and `to`.

**State Adjustments:**
- `ix` will be the next element in `idx`.
- `one` and `to` will be updated based on the previous iteration's conditions.

**State:**
- `ix` is the next element in `idx`.
- `one` is a list that may have had an element added in the previous iteration.
- `to` is a list that may have had an element added in the previous iteration.
- The conditions for adding `ix` to `one` or `to` will be re-evaluated with the new `ix`.

State: **`ix` is the next element in `idx`, `one` is a list that may have had an element added in the previous iteration, `to` is a list that may have had an element added in the previous iteration.**
