To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `idx`, which is a non-empty list of indices sorted based on the values in `val` at the indices specified by `idx` and in case of ties, the indices themselves. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `idx`.

2. **State Variables**:
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `one` is updated based on the conditions involving `ix`, `one`, and `val`.
   - `to` is updated based on the conditions involving `ix`, `to`, and `val`.
   - `idx` is a non-empty list of indices.
   - `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`.
   - `inf` is `float('inf')`.
   - `n` is the value returned by `gil()`.

3. **Current State**:
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `one` is a list that may contain the value of `ix` if certain conditions are met.
   - `to` is updated to `[ix]` if certain conditions are met.
   - `idx` is a non-empty list of indices.
   - `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`.
   - `inf` is `float('inf')`.
   - `n` is the value returned by `gil()`.

4. **Adjustments for Next Iteration**:
   - The variable `ix` will be the next element in `idx`.
   - The list `idx` must have at least one more element for the loop to execute again.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the following adjustments:

- `ix` is the next element in `idx`.
- `one` and `to` are updated based on the conditions involving the new `ix`.
- The rest of the variables (`_`, `idx`, `val`, `inf`, and `n`) remain as they are, unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is a list that may contain the value of `ix` if `ix` is greater than `(one[-1] if one else -1)` and `val[ix]` is less than or equal to `(val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, otherwise `one` remains an empty list. `to` is updated to `[ix]` if `ix` is greater than `(to[-1] if to else -1)` and `val[ix]` is greater than `(val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, otherwise `to` remains an empty list or the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional block. `idx` is a non-empty list of indices with at least one more element, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, and `n` is the value returned by `gil()`.**
