The value of `ix` is appended to the list `one`. Since `one` was either `[next_ix]` or remained the same before, now `one` will be `[next_ix, ix]` or `[ix]` respectively. The length of `one` increases by 1, which means the sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` can now be 1, 2, or 3 (less than or equal to `n`). The other variables (`_`, `to`, `idx`, `val`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is either [next_ix, ix] or [ix], `to` is either [next_ix] or remains the same, `idx` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` where `n` must be greater than 0, `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`, the sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is 1, 2, or 3 (less than or equal to `n`), `n` is the value returned by `gil()`, `ix` is the next element in `idx`.**
