The code appends the current value of `ix` to the list `to`. This action changes the state of `to` by adding a new element at the end of the list, which is the value of `ix`.

Output State: **`ix` is not greater than `(one[-1] if one else -1)` or `val[ix]` is greater than `(val[to[0]] if to else inf)`. Additionally, all other variables retain their initial states as described in the precondition. The current value of `ix` is greater than `(to[-1] if to else -1)`. `to` now includes `ix` as its last element.**
