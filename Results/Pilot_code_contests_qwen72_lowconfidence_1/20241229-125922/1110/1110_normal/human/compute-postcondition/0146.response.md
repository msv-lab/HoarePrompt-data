The code `to.append(ix)` appends the current value of `ix` to the list `to`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `one` and `to` are lists of integers where `one` is either `[next_ix, ix]`, `[ix]`, or remains the same, and `to` is either `[next_ix, ix]`, `[ix]`, `[next_ix]`, or remains the same. The sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is 0, 1, 2, or 3 (less than or equal to `n`).
- `idx` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` where `n` must be greater than 0.
- `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`.
- `n` is the value returned by `gil()`.
- `ix` is the next element in `idx`.
- If the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)` is not met, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

After executing the code `to.append(ix)`:
- The value of `ix` is appended to the list `to`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `one` is either `[next_ix, ix]`, `[ix]`, or remains the same.
- `to` is either `[next_ix, ix]`, `[ix]`, `[next_ix]`, or remains the same, but now with `ix` appended to it.
- The sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is 1, 2, 3, or 4 (less than or equal to `n`).
- `idx` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` where `n` must be greater than 0.
- `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`.
- `n` is the value returned by `gil()`.
- `ix` is the next element in `idx`.
- If the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)` is not met, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is either `[next_ix, ix]`, `[ix]`, or remains the same, `to` is either `[next_ix, ix]`, `[ix]`, `[next_ix]`, or remains the same but now with `ix` appended to it, the sum of the lengths of `one` and `to` is 1, 2, 3, or 4 (less than or equal to `n`), `idx` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` where `n` must be greater than 0, `val` is updated to the value returned by `gbs()`, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`, `ix` is the next element in `idx`, if the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)` is not met, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
