The code `one.append(ix)` adds the value of `ix` to the list `one`. This impacts the state of the `one` list, which was initially empty, making it now contain one element, specifically the value of `ix`.

Therefore, the updated output state is:
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `one` is a list containing the value of `ix`
- `to` is an empty list
- `idx` is a non-empty list of indices sorted based on the values in `val` at the indices specified by `idx` and in case of ties, the indices themselves
- `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`
- `inf` is `float('inf')`
- `n` is the value returned by `gil()`
- `ix` is greater than `-1`
- `val[ix]` is less than or equal to `inf`

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is a list containing the value of `ix`, `to` is an empty list, `idx` is a non-empty list of indices sorted based on the values in `val` at the indices specified by `idx` and in case of ties, the indices themselves, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`, `ix` is greater than `-1`, `val[ix]` is less than or equal to `inf`**
