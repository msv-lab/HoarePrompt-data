The code snippet `to.append(ix)` adds the value of `ix` to the list `to`. Based on the initial state, `to` could either be an empty list or contain elements depending on the conditions described. After this operation, `to` will definitely contain `ix` as its last element.

- `_` is incremented by 1 (unchanged).
- `one` is a list that may contain the value of `ix` under certain conditions (unchanged).
- `to` is updated to include `ix` as its last element.
- `idx` is a non-empty list of indices with at least one more element (unchanged).
- `val` is the value returned by `gbs()` (unchanged).
- `inf` is `float('inf')` (unchanged).
- `n` is the value returned by `gil()` (unchanged).

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is a list that may contain the value of `ix` if `ix` is greater than `(one[-1] if one else -1)` and `val[ix]` is less than or equal to `(val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, otherwise `one` remains an empty list, `to` is a list containing `ix` as its last element, `idx` is a non-empty list of indices with at least one more element, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, and `n` is the value returned by `gil()`**.
