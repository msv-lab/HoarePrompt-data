The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional structure it is currently within. The values of the variables do not change, but the control flow of the program does.

Output State: **`ix` is not greater than `(one[-1] if one else -1)` or `val[ix]` is greater than `(val[to[0]] if to else inf)`. Additionally, `ix` is less than or equal to `(to[-1] if to else -1)`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
