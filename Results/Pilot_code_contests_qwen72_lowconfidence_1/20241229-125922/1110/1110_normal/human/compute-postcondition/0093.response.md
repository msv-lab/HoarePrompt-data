Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `ix` is the next element in `idx`, `idx` is a non-empty list of indices with at least one more element, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, and `n` is the value returned by `gil()`. If `ix` is greater than the last element in `one` (or -1 if `one` is empty) and `val[ix]` is less than or equal to `val[to[0]]` (or `inf` if `to` is empty), then `one` now includes the value of `ix`. Otherwise, if `ix` is greater than the last element in `to` (or -1 if `to` is empty), `to` includes the new element `ix`. If neither condition is met, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
