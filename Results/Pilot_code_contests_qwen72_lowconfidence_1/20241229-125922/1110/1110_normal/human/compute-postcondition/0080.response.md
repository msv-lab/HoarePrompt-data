Postcondition: ***`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is an empty list, `idx` is a non-empty list of indices sorted based on the values in `val` at the indices specified by `idx` and in case of ties, the indices themselves, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`, and either `ix <= (one[-1] if one else -1)` or `val[ix] > (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`. If `ix` is greater than `(to[-1] if to else -1)`, `to` is updated to `[ix]`. Otherwise, `to` remains an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.***
