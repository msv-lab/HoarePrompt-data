The code `val[ix] = 2` updates the value of `val` at the index `ix` to 2. Given that `ix` is the second element in the original `to`, this assignment does not change the fact that `val[ix]` was already 2 according to the initial state. Therefore, the assignment has no net effect on the state of the variables.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by the length of `one`, `one` contains indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1)` and `val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `to` contains indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (to[-1] if to else -1)` and `val[ix] > (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `idx` is a sorted list of indices based on `val` and ties resolved by the indices themselves, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, `n` is the value returned by `gil()`, the combined length of `one` and `to` is equal to `n`, `val[ix]` is 2 for the second element `ix` in the original `to`, `to` must have at least 1 element, `ix` is the second element in the original `to`.**
