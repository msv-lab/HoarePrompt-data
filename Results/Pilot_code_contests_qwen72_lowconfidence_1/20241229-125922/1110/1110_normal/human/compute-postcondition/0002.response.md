The code defines a lambda function `gil` that reads a line from standard input, strips it, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts each string in the list to an integer.

Output State: **The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, each involving a sequence of digits. The input includes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) indicating the length of the digit sequence, and a string of `n` digits (0-9). The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `g` is a function that reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and returns the result. `gl` is a lambda function that calls `g()`, strips the result, and splits it into a list of strings. `gil` is a lambda function that converts a list of strings (read by `gl`) into a list of integers.**
