Postcondition: ***`ix` is the next element in `idx`. If `ix` is greater than the last element of `one` (or -1 if `one` is empty) and `val[ix]` is less than or equal to `val[to[0]]` (or infinity if `to` is empty), `ix` is appended to `one`, and `to` may be updated based on the conditions. If `ix` is greater than the last element of `to` (or -1 if `to` is empty), `to` now includes `ix` as its last element. In either case, the loop will break if neither condition is met.***
