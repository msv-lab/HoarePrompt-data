The code snippet `one.append(ix)` adds the value of `ix` to the list `one`. This means that `one` will now contain at least one element, which is `ix`.

- `_` is incremented by 1 (remains unchanged).
- `one` is a list that contains `ix` if the conditions specified in the initial state were met. Now, `one` definitely contains `ix`.
- `to` is updated to `[ix]` under certain conditions, but this line of code does not affect `to` directly.
- `idx` is a non-empty list of indices with at least one more element (remains unchanged).
- `val` is the value returned by `gbs()` (remains unchanged).
- `inf` is `float('inf')` (remains unchanged).
- `n` is the value returned by `gil()` (remains unchanged).

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is a list containing `ix`, `to` is updated to `[ix]` if the conditions specified in the initial state were met, otherwise `to` remains an empty list or the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional block, `idx` is a non-empty list of indices with at least one more element, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, and `n` is the value returned by `gil()`.**
