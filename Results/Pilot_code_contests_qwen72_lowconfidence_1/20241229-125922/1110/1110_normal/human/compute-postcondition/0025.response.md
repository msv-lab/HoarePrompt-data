Postcondition: ***If `ix` is greater than the last element of the list `one` (or -1 if `one` is empty) and the value of `val[ix]` is less than or equal to the value of `val[to[0]]` (or infinity if `to` is empty), then `ix` is added to the list `one`. Otherwise, if `ix` is greater than the last element of the list `to` (or -1 if `to` is empty), then `ix` is added to the list `to` as its last element. If neither condition is met, the loop or if statement is exited, and all other variables retain their initial states as described in the precondition.***
