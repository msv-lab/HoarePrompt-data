Postcondition: ***`ix` is not greater than `(one[-1] if one else -1)` or `val[ix]` is greater than `(val[to[0]] if to else inf)`. If `ix` is greater than `(to[-1] if to else -1)`, `to` now includes `ix` as its last element. Otherwise, `ix` is less than or equal to `(to[-1] if to else -1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the precondition.***
