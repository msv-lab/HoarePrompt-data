Postcondition: ***`ix` is the next element in `idx`. If `ix` is greater than the last element of `one` (or -1 if `one` is empty) and `val[ix]` is less than or equal to the first element of `to` (or infinity if `to` is empty), then `ix` is appended to `one`. Otherwise, if `ix` is greater than the last element of `to` (or -1 if `to` is empty), `ix` is appended to `to`. If neither condition is met, `one` remains unchanged from the previous iteration, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
