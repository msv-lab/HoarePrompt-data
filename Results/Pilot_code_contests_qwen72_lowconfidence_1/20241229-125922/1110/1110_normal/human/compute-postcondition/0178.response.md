The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts no explicit parameters but expects input in a specific format: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case comprises an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), indicating the length of a digit sequence, and a string of `n` digits (0-9). The sum of `n` across all test cases should not exceed 2⋅10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. However, the exact nature of the output (the processing logic and the returned value for each test case) is not specified in the given information.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a string of `n` digits (0-9). It returns a result for each test case.**
