Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `one` is a list that may contain the value of `ix` if `ix` is greater than `(one[-1] if one else -1)` and `val[ix]` is less than or equal to `(val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, otherwise `one` remains an empty list. `to` is updated to `[ix]` if `ix` is greater than `(to[-1] if to else -1)` and `val[ix]` is greater than `(val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, otherwise `to` remains an empty list or the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional block. `idx` is a non-empty list of indices sorted based on the values in `val` at the indices specified by `idx` and in case of ties, the indices themselves, `val` is the value returned by `gbs()`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, and `n` is the value returned by `gil()`.**
