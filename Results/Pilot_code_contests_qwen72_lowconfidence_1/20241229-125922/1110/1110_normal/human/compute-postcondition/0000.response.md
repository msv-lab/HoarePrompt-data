The code defines a lambda function `g` that reads a line from the standard input (`stdin`), strips any leading and trailing whitespace characters, and returns the result. This function does not modify any existing variables but introduces a new function `g` into the environment.

Output State: **The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, each involving a sequence of digits. The input includes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) indicating the length of the digit sequence, and a string of `n` digits (0-9). The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `g` is a function that reads a line from `stdin`, strips it, and returns the result.**
