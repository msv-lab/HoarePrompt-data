The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a string of `n` digits (0-9). For each test case, it attempts to partition the digits into two groups: `one` and `to`. The group `one` contains indices where the current digit is greater than the previous digit in `one` and less than or equal to the first digit in `to` (if `to` is not empty). The group `to` contains indices where the current digit is greater than the previous digit in `to` and does not meet the conditions for `one`. If the combined length of `one` and `to` equals `n`, the function prints the modified sequence where digits at indices in `one` are set to 1 and digits at indices in `to` are set to 2. If the combined length of `one` and `to` is less than `n`, the function prints a hyphen (`-`). The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases provided as input. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the input sequence is empty or contains all identical digits, which might affect the partitioning logic.
