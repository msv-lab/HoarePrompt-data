Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the digit sequence `n` and the sequence itself `val`.

2. **Sorting Indices**:
   - It creates a list `idx` containing indices from 0 to `n-1`.
   - It sorts `idx` based on the values in `val` and the indices themselves to ensure a stable sort.

3. **Coloring Digits**:
   - It initializes two lists, `one` and `to`, to keep track of indices that will be colored with 1 and 2, respectively.
   - It iterates over the sorted indices and assigns each index to either `one` or `to` based on the conditions:
     - If the current index `ix` is greater than the last index in `one` and the value at `ix` is less than or equal to the value at the first index in `to`, it appends `ix` to `one`.
     - Otherwise, if `ix` is greater than the last index in `to`, it appends `ix` to `to`.
     - If neither condition is met, it breaks out of the loop.

4. **Validation**:
   - If the combined length of `one` and `to` equals `n`, it means a valid coloring has been found.
   - It then updates the `val` list to reflect the coloring and prints the result.
   - If the combined length is less than `n`, it prints `-` indicating no valid coloring exists.

### Why It Meets the Problem Description:

- **Non-Decreasing Sequence**:
  - The program ensures that the sequence formed by concatenating the digits colored with 1 followed by those colored with 2 is non-decreasing.
  - This is achieved by sorting the indices and then assigning colors based on the conditions mentioned.

- **Handling All Test Cases**:
  - The program processes each test case independently and correctly handles the constraints (e.g., the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2â‹…10^5).

- **Output Format**:
  - The output format matches the problem description: for each test case, it prints a valid coloring or a single hyphen `-` if no valid coloring exists.

### Potential Edge Cases:

- **Single Digit Sequences**:
  - The program correctly handles sequences of length 1 by printing the digit as it is (since a single digit is always non-decreasing).

- **Sequences with Repeated Digits**:
  - The program correctly handles sequences with repeated digits by ensuring the non-decreasing property is maintained.

- **Sequences with No Valid Coloring**:
  - The program correctly identifies and prints `-` for sequences where no valid coloring exists.

Given the above points, the program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
