You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence of n digits d_1d_2 ... d_{n}. You need to paint all the digits in two colors so that:

  * each digit is painted either in the color 1 or in the color 2; 
  * if you write in a row from left to right all the digits painted in the color 1, and then after them all the digits painted in the color 2, then the resulting sequence of n digits will be non-decreasing (that is, each next digit will be greater than or equal to the previous digit). 



For example, for the sequence d=914 the only valid coloring is 211 (paint in the color 1 two last digits, paint in the color 2 the first digit). But 122 is not a valid coloring (9 concatenated with 14 is not a non-decreasing sequence).

It is allowed that either of the two colors is not used at all. Digits painted in the same color are not required to have consecutive positions.

Find any of the valid ways to paint the given sequence of digits or determine that it is impossible to do.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — the number of test cases in the input.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) — the length of a given sequence of digits.

The next line contains a sequence of n digits d_1d_2 ... d_{n} (0 ≤ d_i ≤ 9). The digits are written in a row without spaces or any other separators. The sequence can start with 0.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values ​​of n for all test cases in the input does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

Output

Print t lines — the answers to each of the test cases in the input.

If there is a solution for a test case, the corresponding output line should contain any of the valid colorings written as a string of n digits t_1t_2 ... t_n (1 ≤ t_i ≤ 2), where t_i is the color the i-th digit is painted in. If there are several feasible solutions, print any of them.

If there is no solution, then the corresponding output line should contain a single character '-' (the minus sign).

Note

In the first test case, d=040425524644. The output t=121212211211 is correct because 0022444 (painted in 1) concatenated with 44556 (painted in 2) is 002244444556 which is a sorted sequence of n given digits.
Program:

def func():
    g = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()

        for ix in idx:
            if ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf):
                one.append(ix)
            elif ix > (to[-1] if to else -1):
                to.append(ix)
            else:
                break
        if len(one) + len(to) == n:
            for ix in one:
                val[ix] = 1
            for ix in to:
                val[ix] = 2
            for v in val:
                print(v, end='')
            print()
        else:
            print('-')


```
Output hints: The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a string of `n` digits (0-9). For each test case, it attempts to partition the digits into two groups: `one` and `to`. The group `one` contains indices where the current digit is greater than the previous digit in `one` and less than or equal to the first digit in `to` (if `to` is not empty). The group `to` contains indices where the current digit is greater than the previous digit in `to` and does not meet the conditions for `one`. If the combined length of `one` and `to` equals `n`, the function prints the modified sequence where digits at indices in `one` are set to 1 and digits at indices in `to` are set to 2. If the combined length of `one` and `to` is less than `n`, the function prints a hyphen (`-`). The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases provided as input. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the input sequence is empty or contains all identical digits, which might affect the partitioning logic.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
