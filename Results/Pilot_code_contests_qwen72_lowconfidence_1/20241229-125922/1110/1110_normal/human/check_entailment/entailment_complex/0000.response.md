Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the digit sequence `n` and the sequence itself `val`.

2. **Sorting Indices:**
   - It creates a list of indices `idx` and sorts them based on the values in `val` and their original positions. This ensures that the indices are processed in a way that respects the non-decreasing order requirement.

3. **Partitioning into Two Groups:**
   - The program initializes two lists, `one` and `to`, to keep track of indices that belong to the two groups.
   - It iterates through the sorted indices and adds each index to either `one` or `to` based on the conditions:
     - An index `ix` is added to `one` if it is greater than the last index in `one` and the value at `ix` is less than or equal to the first value in `to` (if `to` is not empty).
     - Otherwise, it is added to `to` if it is greater than the last index in `to`.

4. **Validation and Output:**
   - After processing all indices, the program checks if the combined length of `one` and `to` equals `n`.
   - If true, it sets the values in `val` to 1 for indices in `one` and 2 for indices in `to`, and prints the resulting sequence.
   - If false, it prints a hyphen (`-`), indicating that no valid partition exists.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Digit Sequence:** The program handles single-digit sequences correctly by always printing `1` or `2` as the output.
- **All Identical Digits:** If all digits are the same, the program will partition them into one group (either `one` or `to`), ensuring the output is valid.
- **Empty Test Case:** The program does not handle empty test cases, but this is not a concern since the problem guarantees that `n` is at least 1.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases as specified. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
