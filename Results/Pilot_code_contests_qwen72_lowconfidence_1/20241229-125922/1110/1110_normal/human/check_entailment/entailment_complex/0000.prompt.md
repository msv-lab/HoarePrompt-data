You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a sequence of n digits d_1d_2 ... d_{n}. You need to paint all the digits in two colors so that:

  * each digit is painted either in the color 1 or in the color 2; 
  * if you write in a row from left to right all the digits painted in the color 1, and then after them all the digits painted in the color 2, then the resulting sequence of n digits will be non-decreasing (that is, each next digit will be greater than or equal to the previous digit). 



For example, for the sequence d=914 the only valid coloring is 211 (paint in the color 1 two last digits, paint in the color 2 the first digit). But 122 is not a valid coloring (9 concatenated with 14 is not a non-decreasing sequence).

It is allowed that either of the two colors is not used at all. Digits painted in the same color are not required to have consecutive positions.

Find any of the valid ways to paint the given sequence of digits or determine that it is impossible to do.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — the number of test cases in the input.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) — the length of a given sequence of digits.

The next line contains a sequence of n digits d_1d_2 ... d_{n} (0 ≤ d_i ≤ 9). The digits are written in a row without spaces or any other separators. The sequence can start with 0.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values ​​of n for all test cases in the input does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

Output

Print t lines — the answers to each of the test cases in the input.

If there is a solution for a test case, the corresponding output line should contain any of the valid colorings written as a string of n digits t_1t_2 ... t_n (1 ≤ t_i ≤ 2), where t_i is the color the i-th digit is painted in. If there are several feasible solutions, print any of them.

If there is no solution, then the corresponding output line should contain a single character '-' (the minus sign).

Output

Note

In the first test case, d=040425524644. The output t=121212211211 is correct because 0022444 (painted in 1) concatenated with 44556 (painted in 2) is 002244444556 which is a sorted sequence of n given digits.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, each involving a sequence of digits. The input includes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) indicating the length of the digit sequence, and a string of `n` digits (0-9). The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    g = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    gl = lambda : g().split()
    gil = lambda : [int(var) for var in gl()]
    gfl = lambda : [float(var) for var in gl()]
    gcl = lambda : list(g())
    gbs = lambda : [int(var) for var in g()]
    mod = int(1000000000.0) + 7
    inf = float('inf')
    t, = gil()
    for _ in range(t):
        n, = gil()
        
        val = gbs()
        
        idx = list(xrange(n))
        
        idx.sort(key=lambda x: [val[x], x])
        
        one = []
        
        to = []
        
        for ix in idx:
            if ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf
                ):
                one.append(ix)
            elif ix > (to[-1] if to else -1):
                to.append(ix)
            else:
                break
        
        if len(one) + len(to) == n:
            for ix in one:
                val[ix] = 1
            for ix in to:
                val[ix] = 2
            for v in val:
                print(v, end='')
            print()
        else:
            print('-')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `_` is incremented by `t` (the number of iterations specified by `t`), `one` is a list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `to` is a list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (to[-1] if to else -1)` and do not satisfy the condition for `one`, `idx` is a sorted list of indices based on `val`, `val` is a list of integers, `n` is the length of `val`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, and all other variables remain unchanged from their initial values. For each iteration, if the combined length of `one` and `to` is equal to `n`, then `one` is a non-empty list and `val[ix] = 1` for all `ix` in `one` and `val[ix] = 2` for all `ix` in `to`. The values in `val` are printed without newline characters, followed by a newline character. If the combined length of `one` and `to` is less than `n` for any iteration, a single hyphen (`-`) is printed. After all iterations, `one` and `to` are reset for each new iteration, and the final state of `val` depends on the last iteration where `len(one) + len(to) == n`. If no such iteration exists, `val` retains its original value for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a string of `n` digits (0-9). For each test case, it attempts to partition the digits into two groups: `one` and `to`. The group `one` contains indices where the current digit is greater than the previous digit in `one` and less than or equal to the first digit in `to` (if `to` is not empty). The group `to` contains indices where the current digit is greater than the previous digit in `to` and does not meet the conditions for `one`. If the combined length of `one` and `to` equals `n`, the function prints the modified sequence where digits at indices in `one` are set to 1 and digits at indices in `to` are set to 2. If the combined length of `one` and `to` is less than `n`, the function prints a hyphen (`-`). The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases provided as input. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the input sequence is empty or contains all identical digits, which might affect the partitioning logic.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
