You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence of n digits d_1d_2 ... d_{n}. You need to paint all the digits in two colors so that:

  * each digit is painted either in the color 1 or in the color 2; 
  * if you write in a row from left to right all the digits painted in the color 1, and then after them all the digits painted in the color 2, then the resulting sequence of n digits will be non-decreasing (that is, each next digit will be greater than or equal to the previous digit). 



For example, for the sequence d=914 the only valid coloring is 211 (paint in the color 1 two last digits, paint in the color 2 the first digit). But 122 is not a valid coloring (9 concatenated with 14 is not a non-decreasing sequence).

It is allowed that either of the two colors is not used at all. Digits painted in the same color are not required to have consecutive positions.

Find any of the valid ways to paint the given sequence of digits or determine that it is impossible to do.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — the number of test cases in the input.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) — the length of a given sequence of digits.

The next line contains a sequence of n digits d_1d_2 ... d_{n} (0 ≤ d_i ≤ 9). The digits are written in a row without spaces or any other separators. The sequence can start with 0.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values ​​of n for all test cases in the input does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

Output

Print t lines — the answers to each of the test cases in the input.

If there is a solution for a test case, the corresponding output line should contain any of the valid colorings written as a string of n digits t_1t_2 ... t_n (1 ≤ t_i ≤ 2), where t_i is the color the i-th digit is painted in. If there are several feasible solutions, print any of them.

If there is no solution, then the corresponding output line should contain a single character '-' (the minus sign).

Example

Note

In the first test case, d=040425524644. The output t=121212211211 is correct because 0022444 (painted in 1) concatenated with 44556 (painted in 2) is 002244444556 which is a sorted sequence of n given digits.

            elif ix > (to[-1] if to else -1):
                to.append(ix)

                break
        if len(one) + len(to) == n:
            for ix in one:
                val[ix] = 1
            for ix in to:
                val[ix] = 2
            for v in val:
                print(v, end='')
            print()
        else:
            print('-')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical flaw in how it processes the indices for the digits. Specifically, the condition `if ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf):` does not correctly handle all edge cases, especially when the sequence has repeated digits or when the sequence is already sorted.

Consider the following test case:

```
1
4
1122
```

Expected output:
```
1122
```

Actual output:
```
-
```

The program fails to correctly identify that the sequence `1122` can be painted as `1122`, which is a valid non-decreasing sequence. This indicates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, each involving a sequence of digits. The input includes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) indicating the length of the digit sequence, and a string of `n` digits (0-9). The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

        for ix in idx:
            if ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf
                ):
                one.append(ix)
            elif ix > (to[-1] if to else -1):
                to.append(ix)
            else:
                break
        
        if len(one) + len(to) == n:
            for ix in one:
                val[ix] = 1
            for ix in to:
                val[ix] = 2
            for v in val:
                print(v, end='')
            print()
        else:
            print('-')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `_` is incremented by `t` (the number of iterations specified by `t`), `one` is a list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf)`, `to` is a list of indices from `idx` that satisfy the condition `ix > (to[-1] if to else -1)` and do not satisfy the condition for `one`, `idx` is a sorted list of indices based on `val`, `val` is a list of integers, `n` is the length of `val`, `inf` is `float('inf')`, and all other variables remain unchanged from their initial values. For each iteration, if the combined length of `one` and `to` is equal to `n`, then `one` is a non-empty list and `val[ix] = 1` for all `ix` in `one` and `val[ix] = 2` for all `ix` in `to`. The values in `val` are printed without newline characters, followed by a newline character. If the combined length of `one` and `to` is less than `n` for any iteration, a single hyphen (`-`) is printed. After all iterations, `one` and `to` are reset for each new iteration, and the final state of `val` depends on the last iteration where `len(one) + len(to) == n`. If no such iteration exists, `val` retains its original value for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a string of `n` digits (0-9). For each test case, it attempts to partition the digits into two groups: `one` and `to`. The group `one` contains indices where the current digit is greater than the previous digit in `one` and less than or equal to the first digit in `to` (if `to` is not empty). The group `to` contains indices where the current digit is greater than the previous digit in `to` and does not meet the conditions for `one`. If the combined length of `one` and `to` equals `n`, the function prints the modified sequence where digits at indices in `one` are set to 1 and digits at indices in `to` are set to 2. If the combined length of `one` and `to` is less than `n`, the function prints a hyphen (`-`). The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases provided as input. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the input sequence is empty or contains all identical digits, which might affect the partitioning logic.
