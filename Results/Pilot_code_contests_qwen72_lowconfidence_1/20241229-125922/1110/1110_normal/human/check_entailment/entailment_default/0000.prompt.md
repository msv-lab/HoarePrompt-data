You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

Output hints: The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation:The code originally looks correct. The function hints agree with the code and with their help we determine that the code indeed follows the problem description. the function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints: The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect and not follow the problem description. We also see that the output hints agree with the code and they also help prove that the code is incorrect.  The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Output hints: The function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. If the taget is at the last index it wont be found as the loop will break before reaching the last index.

Example answer 3:
Explanation: Originnaly the code looks correct but after confirming that the output hints agree with the code,we can see the function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the list. However, the termination condition of the while loop is `left < right`, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely when `left` is equal to `right`. This condition can lead to missing the target element if it is at the last index of the list. Also when left and right are adjacent then mid will always be left leading to infinate loop.
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence of n digits d_1d_2 ... d_{n}. You need to paint all the digits in two colors so that:

  * each digit is painted either in the color 1 or in the color 2; 
  * if you write in a row from left to right all the digits painted in the color 1, and then after them all the digits painted in the color 2, then the resulting sequence of n digits will be non-decreasing (that is, each next digit will be greater than or equal to the previous digit). 



For example, for the sequence d=914 the only valid coloring is 211 (paint in the color 1 two last digits, paint in the color 2 the first digit). But 122 is not a valid coloring (9 concatenated with 14 is not a non-decreasing sequence).

It is allowed that either of the two colors is not used at all. Digits painted in the same color are not required to have consecutive positions.

Find any of the valid ways to paint the given sequence of digits or determine that it is impossible to do.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — the number of test cases in the input.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) — the length of a given sequence of digits.

The next line contains a sequence of n digits d_1d_2 ... d_{n} (0 ≤ d_i ≤ 9). The digits are written in a row without spaces or any other separators. The sequence can start with 0.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values ​​of n for all test cases in the input does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

Output

Print t lines — the answers to each of the test cases in the input.

If there is a solution for a test case, the corresponding output line should contain any of the valid colorings written as a string of n digits t_1t_2 ... t_n (1 ≤ t_i ≤ 2), where t_i is the color the i-th digit is painted in. If there are several feasible solutions, print any of them.

If there is no solution, then the corresponding output line should contain a single character '-' (the minus sign).

-

Note

In the first test case, d=040425524644. The output t=121212211211 is correct because 0022444 (painted in 1) concatenated with 44556 (painted in 2) is 002244444556 which is a sorted sequence of n given digits.
Program:
```
from __future__ import print_function
from collections import Counter, OrderedDict
from itertools import permutations as perm
from collections import deque
from sys import stdin
from bisect import *
from heapq import *
import math

def func():
    g = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    gl = lambda : g().split()
    gil = lambda : [int(var) for var in gl()]
    gfl = lambda : [float(var) for var in gl()]

    mod = int(1000000000.0) + 7
    inf = float('inf')
    (t,) = gil()
    for _ in range(t):
        (n,) = gil()
        val = gbs()
        idx = list(xrange(n))
        idx.sort(key=lambda x: [val[x], x])
        one = []
        to = []
        for ix in idx:
            if ix > (one[-1] if one else -1) and val[ix] <= (val[to[0]] if to else inf):
                one.append(ix)
            elif ix > (to[-1] if to else -1):
                to.append(ix)
            else:
                break
        if len(one) + len(to) == n:
            for ix in one:
                val[ix] = 1
            for ix in to:
                val[ix] = 2
            for v in val:
                print(v, end='')
            print()
        else:
            print('-')


```
Output hints: The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a string of `n` digits (0-9). For each test case, it attempts to partition the digits into two groups: `one` and `to`. The group `one` contains indices where the current digit is greater than the previous digit in `one` and less than or equal to the first digit in `to` (if `to` is not empty). The group `to` contains indices where the current digit is greater than the previous digit in `to` and does not meet the conditions for `one`. If the combined length of `one` and `to` equals `n`, the function prints the modified sequence where digits at indices in `one` are set to 1 and digits at indices in `to` are set to 2. If the combined length of `one` and `to` is less than `n`, the function prints a hyphen (`-`). The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases provided as input. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the input sequence is empty or contains all identical digits, which might affect the partitioning logic.

Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
