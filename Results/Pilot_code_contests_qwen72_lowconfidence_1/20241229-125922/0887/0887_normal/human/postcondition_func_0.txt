The function `func_1` takes a list `a` of distinct tuples `(x, y)` where each coordinate is an integer within the range -105 to 105. It processes these coordinates to compute the minimum and maximum `y` values for each transformed `x` coordinate (using the formula `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005`). The function then adjusts these minimum and maximum values to ensure they are non-decreasing and non-increasing, respectively, across the range of transformed `x` values. Finally, it calculates and returns the sum of `(lmx[j] - lmn[j]) / 2` for all `j` from 0 to 200008 where `lmn[j] < lmx[j]`. If no such `j` exists, the function returns 0. The input list `a` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the function.
